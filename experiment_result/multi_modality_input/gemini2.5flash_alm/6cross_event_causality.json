This activation of rhodopsin is the first step that sets in motion the entire signaling cascade, ultimately leading to the closing of Na+ channels and decreased neurotransmitter release. Without this initial activation, the subsequent steps would not occur.\n\nOption B describes the direct enzymatic action that leads to the closing of the Na+ channels: 'Activated rhodopsin activates phosphodiesterase, converting cGMP to GMP and reducing cGMP available to keep cyclic nucleotide-gated Na+ channels open.' The reduction of cGMP is what directly causes the Na+ channels to close, leading to hyperpolarization and decreased neurotransmitter release.\n\nBoth events are direct causes in the cascade leading to the decreased neurotransmitter release, with A being the initiating event and B being the immediate biochemical mechanism that directly affects the Na+ channels."

Event 7 (mechanically forcing through a screen described as messy) is a filtration step prone to loss. Event 9 (using coffee filters and a 'poor man’s squeezing method') is a filtration step where inefficiencies and potential damage to the filter could cause loss. Event 8 (repeated washing and transfers using siphoning) involves multiple opportunities for solid material to be left behind or accidentally removed with the liquid. Event 12, crushing the drying material, occurs *after* washing and filtration and is primarily for drying, not the main cause of losses in washing or filtration itself, although minor airborne loss could occur."

Event 4, where Pasteur proved bacteria cause fermentation and that bacteria arise from other bacteria, is crucial because it established causal mechanisms for bacterial action (relevant to spoilage and beneficial processes) and disproved spontaneous generation, which is fundamental to controlling their spread. Event 5, Koch's advancement of germ theory directly linked bacteria to disease (harmful bacteria) and his development of methods for growing bacteria on nutrient materials provided the essential practical tools for systematically studying, identifying, and ultimately controlling or utilizing bacteria in a laboratory setting. Both these developments were foundational for the capabilities mentioned in Event 16. Leeuwenhoek's initial observation (Event 3) was a prerequisite but didn't provide the causal or methodological insights needed for control and utilization. The explanation of flagella (Event 15) describes a specific bacterial characteristic but is not a broad enabler of the capability to control and use bacteria."

Event B explicitly summarizes this property on the blackboard and immediately poses the exact question, directly linking the concept to the query. Event C provides the foundational knowledge of how acids and bases react with litmus, which is essential for the reasoning process: it allows for the elimination of acids (since blue litmus would turn red) and the consideration of bases (as blue litmus would also remain blue), thus enabling the identification of 'neutral' as a valid possibility."

This convergence directly establishes the confidence in the cosmological parameters. Event 3 then explicitly states these precise values on the plot (omega matter of about 0.3, and an equation-of-state near -1 for dark energy), which are the direct numerical inputs for the pie chart's percentages and characteristics in Event 4.

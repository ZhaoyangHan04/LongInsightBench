It also states that 'The video concludes with a black screen,' which the overall video description identifies as the 'VIDEO AND FOOTAGE CREDITS.' This segment thus contains the on-screen overlays for liking and subscribing, followed by the credits list at the very end of the video. The presence of these elements at the conclusion of the video also implies the 'brief electronic stinger on audio' typical of an outro."

This part of the explanation begins around 00:01:50, where the speaker states, 'But I didn't want to start in that special crop mode... Instead, I get the planet all framed up and centered in one of the other video modes... and then I just try to quickly switch to the crop mode and record a very short video before the planet leaves the frame.' This explanation, accompanied by the camera screen visuals, continues until about 00:02:41. Therefore, option A best captures the entire described scenario."

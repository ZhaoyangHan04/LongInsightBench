    "question": "When does the segment show the “24 different injuries” montage (including a yellow-jersey player receiving medical attention, talking with a coach wearing an “Evonik Industries” logo, and a person on crutches with a knee brace) while the narrator says another Barcelona midfielder in the same position has been injured at least 24 times and that “every time Gundo came back, he came back better”?",

    "model_reason": "During the time frame [00:03:58 - 00:04:51], the audio features a description of another Barcelona player, specifically Ilkay Gündoğan (\"Gundo\"), who is mentioned as having been injured multiple times but always coming back stronger. This aligns with the visual montage described, showing images related to injuries and recovery."

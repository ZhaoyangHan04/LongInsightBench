      "C: He begins by praising Giannis’ defense and playmaking without mentioning his jumper, then pivots to predicting that voter fatigue will certainly stop any MVP bid, and ends by focusing on other contenders only. The game footage and web pages are background while he minimizes any personal improvement. His tone remains flat and unconvinced.",
      "D: He jumps from discussing a Hornets loss and Royce O’Neal to previewing Lakers–Kings, never returning to Giannis’ skills, and closes without referencing odds. The visuals mostly showcase broadcast tickers rather than any analysis. His tone stays casual and noncommittal."

    "model_reason": "The host starts by acknowledging the \"no bag\" critique in the preseason context, then reacts to live clips where Giannis takes quicker, in-rhythm jumpers and mid-range looks, before weighing Vegas odds to argue the improvement could overcome voter fatigue. Visuals move from the red-room monologue to NBA TV game footage and finally to an MVP odds page, mirroring the shift from observation to analysis. The audio escalates from curiosity to \"hand him another MVP\" assertions and then to a measured breakdown of odds."

    "options": [
      "A: She cheerfully greets viewers and introduces a video about what to bring to volleyball tournaments, then prompts them to take notes. On-screen text urges viewers to “GRAB A PAPER AND PENCIL,” and she immediately begins a numbered list, starting with deodorant and moving to a water bottle and lotion while holding each item up. Her spoken explanations stress hygiene and hydration as foundational essentials.",
      "B: She first jumps into gym gameplay without clarifying the topic, then much later welcomes viewers and gives a brief summary. Only after that does she casually mention snacks, with no on-screen prompts to prepare to take notes, and she avoids demonstrating early items.",
      "C: She downplays making lists and recommends packing on the fly, beginning with food and saving hygiene tips for the very end. The opening consists mainly of music with no clear instruction to write anything down.",
      "D: She opens by outlining a strict practice drill schedule and only afterward remembers to mention gear in passing. There is no invitation to prepare to take notes, and the first items she highlights are a phone charger and lunch rather than hygiene-focused basics."

    "question": "Considering the speaker’s evolving stance, how does her view of practice shift from individual, domestic making to a collaborative pedagogy and ethics, as shown and said across the video?",
    "options": [
      "A: She introduces herself as an artist and “ambassador of entanglement” amid rustic, task-filled interiors, then states that “being is the practice,” linking everyday work to art. She later emphasizes that installations must be livable systems and, in summer, become a school where work-styles are practiced together. The trajectory culminates in dinner-table conversations and an articulated “ethics of comportment.”",
      "B: She distances herself from domestic labor and pivots to solitary studio pursuits, minimizing communal participation. Summers are closed to students, and winter becomes a time for private, individual study. The language of comportment and conversation is deemphasized over time.",
      "C: She reframes cleaning, arranging, and making as conceptually charged practice and then extends this into livable, everyday installations. From there, the project scales into a collaborative school that transcends institutions through conversation, culminating in a social and political “ethics of comportment.”",
      "D: Her stance moves from running a conventional academic lecture series with grades to turning the project into a boutique fashion label based in the city. Public lectures give way to gallery openings, replacing communal meals and glossaries with brand showcases."

      "A"
    ],
    "model_reason": "The speaker's perspective evolves from an individual focus on domestic and artistic practice to a collaborative approach that integrates work, art, and education. She emphasizes the importance of making everyday life an artful experience, transforming her home into a site of change and her art projects into livable systems. Her vision for the project includes turning it into a school where students can engage in large-scale, collaborative projects, and she values the role of conversation and social interaction in the creative process. This progression is reflected in her use of terms like \"ambassador of entanglement\" and her focus on the \"ethics of comportment."

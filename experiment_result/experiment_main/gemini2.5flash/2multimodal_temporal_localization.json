These two events are separated in the video:\n- The statement about Jon Moxley making history by defeating Tetsuya Naito occurs around [00:07:13 - 00:07:15]. This is covered by option D.\n- The reading of Moxley's quote (\"In all likelihood, I'll probably only get one shot at the IWGP championship in my entire life. That's fine. I'm only gonna need one.\") from the taped red paper on screen occurs from approximately [00:07:38 - 00:07:44]. This is covered by option B and partially by C.\n\nSince no single option encompasses both parts of this compound event, we must select the option(s) that best align with the most distinctive and visually verifiable part of the request. The visual cue of \"the screen shows a taped red paper displaying that quote\" is a strong identifier for the second part of the condition.\n\n- Option B ([00:07:36 - 00:07:44]) accurately covers the entire duration when the taped red paper with the quote is displayed and the narrator reads the quote.\n- Option C ([00:07:40 - 00:07:48]) starts after the quote has begun to be read, making it less precise than option B for this specific event.\n\nTherefore, option B is the most appropriate choice for the segment describing the quote reading from the taped paper, which is the latter and more detailed part of the question's combined condition."

This occurs while the file explorer and later the FIFA Editor Tool website/Mod Manager download page are visible.\n\nNo single moment perfectly aligns the *specific* MEGA download page visual with *all three* auditory cues simultaneously, as some audio cues occur after the initial MEGA page is no longer on screen. However, we need to choose the option that best encompasses all these elements.\n\n* Option A: **[00:02:05 - 00:03:21]**\n * The MEGA download page for \"FIFA 22 Russian Mod Lite.rar\" is visible at the beginning of this segment (**[00:02:05 - 00:02:19]**).\n * The discussion about WinRAR/7-Zip starts at **[00:02:08]** (within the MEGA page visual) and continues throughout the segment.\n * The instruction to \"extract the whole folder\" is given at **[00:02:38]** (within this segment).\n * The mention of \"FIFA Mod Manager\" is made at **[00:02:55]** (within this segment).\n This option includes the visual and all mentioned audio cues, even if they are not perfectly simultaneous throughout the entire duration of the visual. It's the most comprehensive time frame.\n\n* Option B: **[00:00:38 - 00:02:00]** - This segment ends before the MEGA download page for \"FIFA 22 Russian Mod Lite.rar\" is fully displayed and does not contain the WinRAR/Mod Manager discussions.\n* Option C: **[00:03:21 - 00:03:33]** - The specific MEGA download page is not visible in this segment.\n* Option D: **[00:04:06 - 00:05:02]** - The specific MEGA download page is not visible in this segment.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the best choice as it contains all the specified visual and auditory elements within its timeframe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$"

The narrator notes that using a network cable would not require the administrative password.\n\nLet's analyze the video:\n*   **Visual (Close-up of modem's back label):** This visual is present from approximately **00:00:59 to 00:01:45**.\n*   **Narration (Explains how to find router's IP):** The narrator states, \"Look on the back and you'll find at the top the IP number that will allow you to access the administrative page of your AT&T U-verse router.\" This occurs from approximately **00:01:03 to 00:01:14**.\n*   **Narration (Notes that using a network cable would not require the administrative password):** The narrator says, \"But only if you are connecting to your U-verse router wirelessly. Because if you are connected via network cable, then the administrative page can be accessed without any password.\" This occurs from approximately **00:01:30 to 00:01:42**.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A: [00:00:59 - 00:01:20]**\n    *   **Visual:** Yes, the close-up of the label is present.\n    *   **Narration (IP explanation):** Yes, the entire explanation of finding the IP (00:01:03 - 00:01:14) falls within this segment.\n    *   **Narration (Cable password note):** This segment contains the *start* of the discussion about passwords (00:01:17), but not the specific note about *not* needing a password with a network cable, which comes later. Therefore, this condition is not fully met within this segment.\n\n*   **B: [00:01:20 - 00:01:40]**\n    *   **Visual:** Yes, the close-up of the label is present.\n    *   **Narration (IP explanation):** No, the explanation of finding the IP finished before this segment started.\n    *   **Narration (Cable password note):** Yes, the entire note about not needing a password with a network cable (00:01:30 - 00:01:42) falls within this segment (and extends just slightly beyond the end of the segment, but the core statement is captured).\n\n*   **C: [00:00:00 - 00:00:30]**\n    *   **Visual:** No close-up of the modem's back label.\n    *   **Narration:** Neither specific narration point occurs.\n\n*   **D: [00:01:44 - 00:02:07]**\n    *   **Visual:** The close-up of the modem's back label is visible only briefly at the very beginning of this segment (until ~00:01:45), then the screen changes.\n    *   **Narration (IP explanation):** No, the IP explanation was prior to this segment.\n    *   **Narration (Cable password note):** The narrator states \"In my case, since I'm connected to my AT&T U-verse router via a network cable, I am not prompted for a password\" (00:02:00 - 00:02:06), which fulfills this condition. However, the visual of the label is mostly gone.\n\nThe question requires \"where the narrator explains how to find the router’s IP **and** notes that using a network cable would not require the administrative password.\" Since these two narration points are sequential and do not overlap, no single option strictly contains both complete explanations. However, the question asks to \"Select all time segments\" where these conditions are met. To cover both narration points while the visual is present:\n\n*   Option **A** covers the \"explains how to find the router’s IP\" part of the narration (00:01:03 - 00:01:14) while the close-up of the label is present.\n*   Option **B** covers the \"notes that using a network cable would not require the administrative password\" part of the narration (00:01:30 - 00:01:42) while the close-up of the label is present.\n\nBoth A and B are necessary to collectively address all the conditions mentioned in the question.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{AB}$"

However, if we interpret \"select all time segments where...\" as selecting multiple relevant segments that collectively address the complex description, then options A and B are the most appropriate.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **A: [00:04:10 - 00:04:20]**\n    *   **Speaker:** A female speaker discusses \"inflationary cosmology\" (00:04:11) and the \"multiverse\" (00:04:14), which is synonymous with parallel universes.\n    *   **Visuals:** This segment features an animated atom (00:04:10 - 00:04:14). It transitions to a pink-ish background with the word \"INFLATION\". This segment contains the \"animated atom\" part of the visual criteria and covers \"inflationary cosmology\" and \"parallel universes\".\n\n*   **B: [00:04:40 - 00:04:53]**\n    *   **Speaker:** The female speaker references ideas supported by \"quantum mechanics\", including \"superposition and wave function collapse\" (00:04:45-00:04:47), and explicitly states that \"these theories are merely speculative\" (00:04:49). This discussion is a continuation of the video's exploration of multiverses/parallel universes from the preceding segment.\n    *   **Visuals:** This segment displays a blue digital background with the words \"QUANTUM PHYSICS\" (00:04:40) and later \"QUANTUM COMPUTING\" (00:04:43). This segment contains the \"blue digital background with QUANTUM COMPUTING\" part of the visual criteria and covers \"superposition and wave function collapse\" and the \"speculative\" nature of the theories.\n\nSince the full set of verbal and visual criteria is split across these two segments, both are necessary to fulfill the prompt."

However, considering the other options, option A is the only one that encompasses the initial visual of crushed plastic bottles and its direct transition into the majority of the specified space imagery, while also containing the primary narration about the James Webb Space Telescope's anniversary. Options B, C, and D either start too late (missing the plastic bottles and initial transition) or are in entirely different parts of the video. Thus, option A is the most fitting, despite the slight mismatch with the voice change's precise timing."

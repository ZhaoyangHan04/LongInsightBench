(2) A female narrator defines boiling point while a diagram shows “Atmospheric Pressure equals Vapor Pressure.” (3) A “Choose a heat source” graphic appears as the narrator says they’ll use a Bunsen burner. (4) The Bunsen burner is lit to a steady blue flame while the narrator explains lighting and adjustment. (5) A “Thermometer placement” diagram appears as glassware is clamped into the distillation setup. (6) The narrator concludes, “Let us review the steps,” with step-by-step text on screen."

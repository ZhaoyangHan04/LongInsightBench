He argues that if you lose your private key, your crypto fund is gone forever, but if you lose your credit card details, you can still get refunded by the bank. However, he corrects this by stating that no bank would be responsible for refunding amounts over $250,000. He also mentions that the Bitcoin blockchain has never been hacked, unlike banks that are frequently hacked. This information directly corresponds to option A.\nThe speaker expresses concerns about Libra's centralization and reliance on Facebook's leadership. He believes that Libra is risky because it is centralized, and people need to trust Facebook to operate well. If Zuckerberg were to step down or be replaced, the speaker doubts whether they would trust the new CEO. This concern aligns with option D.\nThe speaker mentions that Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by 2022 or 2023 and other currencies will become useless. This statement is related to the discussion about the security of Bitcoin compared to fiat currency and the potential future value of Bitcoin. Therefore, option B is relevant to the context.\nThe speaker discusses decentralized websites and their potential to disrupt social media. He suggests that decentralized websites cannot be censored by governments, which could have significant implications for social media platforms like Facebook. This point is connected to the broader discussion about the impact of blockchain technology on various industries, including social media. Hence, option C is relevant to the context."

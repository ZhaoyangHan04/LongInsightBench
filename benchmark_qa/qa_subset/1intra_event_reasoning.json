The audio explains that after losing contact, they move to a frame chosen so that the transformed electric field (from v × B) cancels the gravitational force, thereby converting the cycloidal motion into a circular one. This synthesis identifies option A as correct. Options B, C, and D are not supported: the audio explicitly mentions no electric field in the ground frame and generating one via transformation (not by changing B as in B), the ramp is no longer involved at this stage (contradicting C), and the magnetic field is essential for the circular motion (contradicting D).",

Visually, the slides shown in the same time window include the 'We build solutions for three customer types' graphic that lists 'Enterprise Customers,' reinforcing the enterprise targeting. While C and D reference elements present (hosted in IONOS cloud and a 'rent it now' CTA), neither constitutes evidence of enterprise scale by itself.",

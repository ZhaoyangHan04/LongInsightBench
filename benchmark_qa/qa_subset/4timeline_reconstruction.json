Event 3 is next: the solar system visuals accompany a teaser about the largest object and a playful wind-like SFX just before coronal mass ejections are revealed. Event 4 logically follows, focusing on solar activity’s impact on Earth: the “Carrington Event” title is on screen while the narrator describes 1859 auroras and telegraph failures. Event 5 then moves beyond the solar system to black holes; we see the glowing ring while the narrator calls M87’s black hole “the chad” and mentions its recent photo, with swelling music. Event 6 escalates the scale to the Great Wall: we see “HLGQ (4 bil. light years)” text and hear the narrator question why it counts as a single thing, notably with no music.

That makes (6) next.\n- Storage frustration (events 9–10): He complains that the under-counter storage is a mess and Target bins aren’t enough and mentions needing to properly build something after years (audio in events 9–10) while we see the cluttered storage under the cutting board (visual in event 9). So (1) follows.\n- Wrap-up (event 11): He concludes, “This is how this normally looks… This is my normal day” (audio in event 11) as the camera shows the cramped kitchen/heater/curtain (visual in event 11). This places (7) last.\nTherefore the correct order is 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 1 -> 7 (Option A). Single modality is insufficient: the visuals alone don’t establish the Seattle reference, the WD-40 cleaning method, or his concluding remarks; the audio alone doesn’t show which areas are being referenced (e.g., the exact storage, sink, and food on the bed).",

Finally, event 4 shows FIGURE 1.6 of Earth and the speaker calls Earth the “pale blue dot” and mentions a geostationary satellite—this is sub-event (3). Both modalities are required: the audio cues (“Let’s…jump into the PowerPoint,” “most beautiful thing,” “pale blue dot,” and the orchestral music) anchor the transitions and identify which commentary goes with which visual, while the visuals (specific figure numbers and slide subjects—galaxies, Mars, Orion, Earth) confirm which segment is on screen. Relying on only one modality would make the ordering ambiguous (e.g., multiple space images without the spoken transitions).",

Next comes (3): the Eratosthenes shadow‑diagram appears, and the narrator discusses calculating curvature—exactly the visual diagram and curvature talk in that section (event_id 3). After establishing spherical measurements, (4) is next: the Vanguard I satellite diagram coincides with the narrator naming “1958 Vanguard 1” and describing the “Bartlett pear” deviation—this pairing of the satellite visuals and those specific phrases occurs later (event_id 5). Subsequently, (5) occurs with the on‑screen Copernicus statue as the narrator explains switching from geocentric to heliocentric models (event_id 7). Finally, (6) is last: the DNA helix with “c0nc0rdance” is shown while the host says, “Thanks for watching,” which is the clear audio sign‑off matched to that closing visual (event_id 9).

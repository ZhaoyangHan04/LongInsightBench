This combination appears only from 00:00:47 to 00:01:07. The other ranges feature different topics or speakers: 00:01:07–00:01:39 discusses operator responsibilities, 00:00:00–00:00:47 is the intro, and 00:02:01–00:02:30 covers reporting and documentation timelines.",

This precise visual and audio pairing occurs from 00:02:56 to 00:03:47. The other options show either the same speaker but different topics (00:02:30–00:02:56 discusses SDS content generally; 00:06:17–00:06:49 proposes low-volume exemptions) or different regulatory topics (00:05:54–00:06:17).",

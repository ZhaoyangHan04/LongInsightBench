        "gold_reasoning": "This occurs in event 6. Visually, a 3D terrain visualization appears and the path is seen as blue and yellow dots along the ridge. Auditorily, the speaker explicitly says to show the route in 3D, discusses adding an extra point to include more of the ridge in the 3D view, mentions options like terrain/map images and resolution, and later notes using undo to remove the extra point and compares starting from a bus stop versus the train station. These combined cues uniquely match 00:04:07–00:05:30. The other options correspond to different content: [00:05:39–00:06:09] shows the peak finder and mentions the Eiger (event 8), [00:01:15–00:01:51] is drawing a rough track with no altitude profile yet (event 3), and [00:07:20–00:08:07] covers exporting a GPX and concluding remarks (event 11).",

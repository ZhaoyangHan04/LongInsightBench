The audio simultaneously lists Facebook’s “global expansion,” “lawsuits over address book data,” “government surveillance,” and “preparation for a large IPO,” among other items. Matching both modalities: the world map visually represents global expansion (A); the gavel symbolizes lawsuits (B); and the monetary sign aligns with the IPO preparation (D). The “BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING” graphic denotes government surveillance, not Google Plus competition, so C is incorrect.",

It also notes that in America the approach is to look at the whole world when hiring graduate students, not just Americans. Visually, the setting is a formal venue with a Chilean flag and an engaged audience, and the segment concludes with BCN branding, indicating an institutional context. Therefore, A is correct (policy to accept foreign students with funding; visual of flag/formal hall) and C is correct (global recruitment emphasis; visual BCN branding). B and D contradict the audio’s message (they suggest restricting to domestic students or focusing on tourism), even though the visuals of an attentive audience and ornate venue are present; the audio evidence rules them out.",

The visuals reinforce this by first showing radio telescopes under the Milky Way (context for radio observing) and then a colorful chart of radio frequencies and applications, supporting the idea of focusing on specific, narrow portions of the spectrum (A).

Visually, he pulls out white cleats from a blue/red bag with white stars, then carefully cleans the cleats using a cloth and a liquid he pours into a plastic bag. Thus, A is correct because it combines the audio reason for choosing football cleats with the visual of him cleaning the white cleats. C is correct because the audio references the PDP/USA bag and the visuals show a patriotic, star-covered bag as he accesses his gear. B is incorrect since the audio says the opposite (football cleats are lighter) and the visuals show white, not black, cleats being cleaned, not laced. D contradicts both the audio (he highlights USA branding) and the visuals (the bag is not plain black, and he cleans, not discards, the cleats).",

The audio in the same segment explains it is a waterless, self-contained composting toilet that separates solids and liquids and uses compost material like spagnum peat moss or coconut core fiber, with an agitator used after each use. Combining the visual sign and internals with the audio explanation, the correct reason is that the composting design eliminates the need for a blackwater tank (Option A). The other options conflict with the demonstrator’s audio (no sewer flushing, no use of water to send waste to a grey tank, and it is clearly being demonstrated as functional).",

Therefore, A is correct (audio: sanitizing/testing and automatic shutoff; visual: workers and machines in use). D is also correct because the wash‑pen sprinklers are described in the audio and the workers’ cleaning activity and wet floor support the hygiene context visually.

The audio details that this came from cleaning a crevice—“all of this is crevice material”—and that he “found in the second pan,” noting it was “not as good as the first one but still pretty consistent” and later calling it “a little worse, but it’s still gold.” He also mentions finding loose bedrock to look deeper and hoping to find more “candy,” which aligns with the probing seen on video. Option C contradicts the audio (he says the second pan was worse, not better), and D conflicts with his hedged comment that moving the bedrock made “probably none, but probably some” difference, not a huge one.",

The audio features several excited calls such as “There is a bunny up there,” “There is a chinchilla up there!” and someone pointing out hummingbirds. While the guide also talks about a temple and sacrifices (audio), the specific excited exclamations align with spotting animals. The spider mention is followed by distaste from a woman rather than collective excitement. Therefore, combining the audio of wildlife sightings with the visual of a hummingbird supports that the group’s excitement is due to seeing animals.",

These points (A and B) underpin the argument that not all sediments are deposited quickly. The speaker also contrasts this with pyroclastic material (seen near an erupting volcano in the visuals), stating pyroclast can be deposited rapidly; thus C (calling the white cliffs volcanic ash) is incorrect, and D is the opposite of the audio claim (pyroclast is rapid, not slow), so both are wrong. The conclusion requires the audio’s rates and global occurrence claims and is supported by the chalk visuals.",

Option A accurately reflects the audio’s asymmetry (south bulge slightly larger) and the small magnitude (“yards, not miles”) while being grounded in the visuals of Vanguard 1 and Earth orbits.

Visually, the video reinforces this by showing a close-up of the legal text “U.S. Code § 6426” and displaying the caption “cost parity = cost the same,” directly tying the policy support to achieving equal pricing.

Synthesizing both, these foods are presented as Vitamin A sources that prevent eye-related deficiencies; hence the eye imagery and deficiency labels.

The audio explains using a Dean–Stark trap with low-density, immiscible organic solvents: the solvent–water azeotrope vaporizes, condenses, and water collects in the trap. It also states progress can be monitored by the volume of water collected or by observing the milkiness of the azeotrope. Therefore, A and C match both the visual setup and the audio description. B is inconsistent because the setup explicitly includes a trap rather than only a simple condenser, and D is incorrect because the event does not use a drying tube or monitoring by mass of a drying agent.",

    "video_caption": "The video begins with a black screen, transitioning to a scene featuring two cartoon characters against a light gray background. One character, dressed in a yellow and black outfit with a cape, appears angry, while the other, in a blue superhero costume with a red cape, looks sad. The angry character clenches a fist, and a thought bubble above the sad character reads, \"Why do you make me feel this way?\" The scene shifts to show the angry character with a thought bubble stating, \"Emotional response: anger - immediate - specific.\" The angry character's face turns red, and the text \"feeling subjective experience\" appears next to them. The video then shows a pink bunny wrapped in a blue blanket, looking distressed, with the word \"mood\" above it. Two characters in black outfits with goggles stand beside the bunny, one asking, \"Why's boss like that?\" and the other responding, \"I dunno.\" The video concludes with a text slide stating, \"with stimulus: - immediately feel an emotional response,\" emphasizing the immediate nature of emotional reactions."

    "video_caption": "The video begins with a plain light gray background displaying the text 'components of an emotion' in the center. It then transitions to a similar background with the same text, but now includes additional text in a speech bubble that reads 'immediate & specific response,' and three bullet points below the main text: 'physiological,' 'cognitive,' and 'behavioural.' The scene shifts to an animated character with a white head and yellow arms, dressed in a black suit, standing in front of a control panel with a sign above that reads 'EVIL LAIR.' The character appears to be operating the controls with an intense expression. The text 'cognitive' appears next to the character, followed by 'subjective conscious experience,' and then 'behavioural' with 'characteristic overt expressions.' The scene transitions to a blank light gray background, followed by an image of a book titled 'THE EXPRESSION OF EMOTION IN MAN AND ANIMALS' by Charles Darwin, with a speech bubble above it that reads, 'particular emotional responses tend to accompany the same emotional states in all members of a species.' The video then shows three cartoon cats in different poses, each with a happy expression, followed by a scene of a UFO with a beam of light shining down on a group of small, white, humanoid figures with distressed expressions. The beam contains DNA strands with the text 'TAAGATC' and 'CTAGATT' written on them. The video concludes with the UFO and the figures still in the beam, emphasizing the connection between emotions and genetic expression."

The scene transitions to an animated character in a yellow cape and black suit, operating a control panel in a room labeled \"EVIL LAIR.\" The character's expression changes from neutral to surprised as a superhero figure with a red cape and blue suit with a red 'S' emblem appears in the doorway. The text \"Common-Sense View\" is displayed at the top, and \"stimulus\" appears at the bottom, indicating the character's reaction to the superhero's presence. The character's brain is shown with a light bulb, symbolizing the thought process, and the text \"stimulus > emotion\" appears, followed by \"stimulus > emotion > arousal\" as the character's heart rate increases, depicted by a red heart with black dots. The character's expression shifts to one of determination as they prepare to take action, with the text \"stimulus > emotion > arousal\" remaining on the screen. The video continues with the character's brain again illuminated by a light bulb, emphasizing the cognitive process, and the text \"stimulus > emotion > arousal\" is highlighted in yellow, reinforcing the sequence of events leading to the character's emotional and physical response. The superhero figure remains in the doorway, maintaining the tension and anticipation of the unfolding scenario."

The character's brain is visible, showing a thought bubble with the text 'Common-Sense View' and the sequence 'stimulus > emotion > arousal.' The scene transitions to a plain background with the text 'William James and Carl Lange' and the same sequence 'stimulus > emotion > arousal.' The next frame introduces the 'James-Lange Theory' with the same sequence. The video then returns to the control room scene, where the character's brain is shown again, but this time the sequence changes to 'stimulus > arousal > emotion.' The character's expression changes to one of surprise, and the text 'James-Lange Theory' remains at the top. The video continues with the character in the control room, facing the superhero in the 'EVIL LAIR' doorway. The text 'James-Lange Theory' is displayed at the top, and the sequence 'stimulus > arousal > emotion' is shown at the bottom. The character's brain is visible, and the character's expression changes to one of surprise. The superhero in the doorway remains unchanged, and the background details, such as the control room and the 'EVIL LAIR' sign, are consistent throughout the video. The video emphasizes the James-Lange Theory by showing the sequence 'stimulus > arousal > emotion' and the character's reaction to the superhero."

    "video_caption": "The video begins with a character in a yellow cape and black suit, standing in a control room, facing a superhero figure in a room labeled \"EVIL LAIR.\" The character's heart is visibly beating, indicating arousal, and the text \"James-Lange Theory\" appears at the top, with \"stimulus > arousal > emotion\" at the bottom, illustrating the theory's concept. The scene transitions to a list of criticisms of the James-Lange Theory, highlighting that arousal does not guarantee emotion. The video then shows a character on a beach, looking disgusted, with the word \"GROSS\" above them, followed by a return to the control room scene, emphasizing the theory's stages. The criticisms continue, noting that arousal may not precede emotion and that identical responses can be associated with different emotions. The video illustrates this with characters displaying fear, anger, surprise, and joy, all with a visibly beating heart. The final scene shows a character in a wheelchair, with a clipboard listing emotions like joy, sadness, fear, and contentment, all checked off, suggesting a comprehensive emotional response. The video effectively uses visual and textual elements to explain the James-Lange Theory and its criticisms, with a focus on the relationship between stimuli, arousal, and emotion."

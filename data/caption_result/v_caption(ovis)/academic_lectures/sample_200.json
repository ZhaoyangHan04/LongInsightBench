The video then presents a table labeled \"Student Table,\" listing student information such as BID, REG_ID, NAME, BRANCH, and EMAIL. Below the table, the keys are listed as SID, REG_ID, and EMAIL. The video continues to elaborate on the concept of super keys by showing additional combinations of these keys, such as SID + REG_ID, REG_ID + EMAIL, and EMAIL + SID. The final frame reiterates the definition of a super key, emphasizing that it is an attribute or set of attributes that can identify a row of data in a table.

The interface is designed to allow users to search for a student by either their Student ID (SID) or Registration ID (REG_ID). The background of the slide is white with a blue cloud-like shape in the top right corner. The video then transitions to a frame where the REG_ID column in the table is highlighted with a red border, and a red arrow points to it, emphasizing its importance. The search bar now displays \"REG_ID\" as the input, indicating that the user has selected to search by REG_ID. The final frame of the video presents a slide with bullet points explaining the concept of primary and alternate keys in a database. It states that if REG_ID is chosen as the primary key, then SID and EMAIL will become alternate keys.

The slide then introduces a new entry for a student named Shelly with a BRANCH_CODE of 'EIC,' which is not allowed by the database as there is no corresponding entry in the Branch Table for 'EIC.' The video then transitions to a slide showing the Branch Table with columns BRANCH_CODE, BRANCH_NAME, and HOD, listing entries for CS, ME, IT, and ECE. A red arrow points to the Branch Table, indicating that an entry in the Student Table is being updated, but a DB error occurs due to the absence of 'EIC' in the Branch Table.

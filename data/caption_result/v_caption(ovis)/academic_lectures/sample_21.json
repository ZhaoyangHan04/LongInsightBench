The households are depicted with red houses and the firms with grey buildings. The text \"cY 0.8\" and \"Savings (S) 0.2\" are displayed, representing the consumption rate and savings rate, respectively. As the video progresses, the diagram updates to show \"Consumption, C = 80m\" and \"Consumption, C = 64m,\" reflecting changes in consumption levels. The savings amount is adjusted to \"16\" and \"20,\" indicating variations in savings. The video maintains a clean, white background throughout, emphasizing the economic concepts being illustrated."

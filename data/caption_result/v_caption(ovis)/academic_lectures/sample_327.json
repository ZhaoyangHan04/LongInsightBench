    "video_caption": "The video begins with a slide introducing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a method for deriving ratio scales from paired comparisons, allowing for some inconsistency in judgment. The slide outlines the inputs, which include actual measurements and subjective opinions, and the outputs, which are ratio scales and consistency index, derived from eigen vectors and eigen values. The background is a light blue gradient, and the text is presented in a combination of dark blue and yellow boxes. The video then transitions to a step-by-step guide of the AHP process, starting with \"Step 1: Define Objective,\" followed by \"Step 2: Structure elements in criteria, sub-criteria, alternatives etc.,\" \"Step 3: Make a pair wise comparison of elements in each group,\" \"Step 4: Calculate weighting and consistency ratio,\" and finally \"Step 5: Evaluate alternatives according weighting.\" Each step is highlighted in a yellow box with a downward arrow indicating the progression from one step to the next. The background remains consistent with the light blue gradient, and the text is presented in a clear, easy-to-read format. The video concludes with a final frame that includes the text \"Set ranking\" in a light grey box, suggesting the final step in the AHP process."

The slide outlines the steps of the process, starting with defining an objective, structuring elements in criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives, making pairwise comparisons, calculating weighting and consistency ratio, evaluating alternatives according to weighting, and concluding with a final recommendation. The next slide specifies the objective as \"Buy a gadget (smart phone, MP3 player...)\" and lists criteria such as color, memory, and delivery, with color options including pink, blue, green, black, and red. The video then transitions to a detailed breakdown of the criteria, including memory options (8 MB, 16 MB, 32 MB, 64 MB) and delivery options (immediate, 5 days, 4 weeks), alongside four gadget models with their respective specifications and prices. The following slide presents a structured hierarchy of the AHP, with the objective \"Gadget to buy\" at the top, followed by criteria and sub-criteria, including color, memory, and delivery, with specific gadget details. The video then shifts to a comparison of elements pairwise with respect to the objective, using a scale from 1 to 9 to indicate the relative importance of each criterion. The final slide emphasizes the importance of pairwise comparisons, showing that memory is 3 times more important than color and delivery is 2 times more important than color, with a visual representation of the scale and a balance scale icon. Throughout the video, the background remains consistently light blue, and the text is presented in a clear, easy-to-read format, with a focus on the logical progression of the Analytic Hierarchy Process."

The slide then transitions to show the results arranged in a matrix format, with the same elements and their pairwise comparisons. The next slide introduces the concept of finding the eigenvector of the matrix, with a formula and instructions for normalization and calculation. An Excel sheet is mentioned as available for these calculations. The video then displays the results of the calculations, including the largest eigenvalue, consistency index, and consistency ratio, with a note that an Excel sheet is available for these computations. The final slide presents the final results of the AHP process, showing the weights assigned to each criterion (Color, Memory, and Delivery) for a \"Gadget to buy\" decision, with percentages indicating their relative importance.

    "video_caption": "The video begins with a slide titled \"AHP\" (Analytic Hierarchy Process) displaying a decision-making framework for choosing a gadget to buy. The framework is divided into three main criteria: Color (17%), Memory (43%), and Delivery (40%). Below this, a table lists the criteria, their weights, and ranks, with Memory being the most important at 43% and ranked first, followed by Delivery at 40% and ranked second, and Color at 17% and ranked third. The background is a light blue, and the text is in a combination of dark blue and yellow.\n\nThe video then transitions to a new slide with the same \"AHP\" title, instructing viewers to \"Compare all elements pair wise with respect to the objective.\" This slide introduces a list of colors: pink, blue, green, black, and red, each enclosed in a beige box. The colors are arranged in a hierarchical structure, with arrows indicating pairwise comparisons between them. The background remains light blue, and the text is in dark blue and yellow.\n\nThe next slide continues with the same title and instruction, showing the pairwise comparisons between the colors. The comparisons are represented by arrows connecting the colors, with numerical values indicating the relative importance of each color in comparison to another. For example, pink is compared to blue with a value of 2, and blue is compared to green with a value of 3. The background and text colors remain consistent with the previous slides.\n\nThe final slide maintains the same title and instruction, displaying the pairwise comparisons with numerical values. The comparisons include fractions, such as 1/7 and 1/3, indicating the relative importance of each color in comparison to another. The slide also includes a note at the bottom stating \"n = 5 results in 10 comparisons,\" explaining the total number of comparisons made. The background and text colors remain consistent throughout the video, providing a cohesive visual presentation of the AHP decision-making process."

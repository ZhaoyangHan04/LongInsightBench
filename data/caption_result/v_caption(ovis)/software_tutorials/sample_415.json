Initially, a stylized cartoon face with blue hair and black sunglasses is displayed on a white canvas, surrounded by various toolbars and panels. The artist uses the software's tools to modify the face, adding a smile and altering the eyes. The interface includes a color palette at the bottom and a layer panel on the right, showing different layers labeled 'cabe√ßa' (head) and 'geral' (general). The artist then switches to a different software, Blender, where a 3D model of the same cartoon face is created. The Blender interface features a dark background with a central viewport displaying the 3D model, surrounded by panels for object tools, render settings, and other options. The artist adjusts the model's position and orientation, eventually animating it to show a sequence of movements. The video concludes with the 3D model in various poses, demonstrating the animation process within Blender."

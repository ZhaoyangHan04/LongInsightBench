The cat sprite's position and orientation change as it completes the loop, ending up at coordinates (-428, -172) and facing 90 degrees. The user then adds a \"wait 1 sec\" block to the script, introducing a delay between each movement and turn, and executes the updated script. The cat sprite moves and turns in a square pattern with a one-second pause between each action, ending up at coordinates (-436, -91) and facing 90 degrees. Finally, the user drags a \"when green flag clicked\" block to the script, indicating that the animation will start when the green flag is clicked, and executes the script again. The cat sprite moves and turns in a square pattern with a one-second pause between each action, ending up at coordinates (-448, -182) and facing 90 degrees.

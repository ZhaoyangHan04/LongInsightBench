The slide explains that singletons allow for easy access to these classes and their properties. The scene transitions to a red background with the question \"Which one are you?\" in white text, prompting viewers to consider their approach to coding. The next frame continues with the same red background, stating \"You assign everything to public fields in the inspector,\" followed by \"or Singletons, everywhere,\" suggesting two contrasting coding styles. An illustration then appears, depicting a character in a red shirt and white gloves, sweating and looking stressed, with a thought bubble showing two buttons labeled \"Singletons\" and \"Using the Inspector,\" indicating a choice between the two methods. The video then shifts to a screenshot of a Unity console displaying multiple \"UnassignedReferenceException\" errors, emphasizing the potential issues that can arise from improper coding practices. The final frame returns to a red background with the text \"Let's mitigate some dependencies!\" in white, suggesting a solution to the problems highlighted in the previous frames.

The Inspector panel shows the properties of the selected 'Cube' object, including its position, rotation, and scale. The Project panel lists assets like 'LeanTween', 'Scenes', and 'Scripts'. The scene then transitions to the GameEvents.cs script file, where the code editor displays the class definition for 'GameEvents' inheriting from 'MonoBehaviour'. The code includes methods like 'Start' and 'Update', with comments explaining their purposes. The 'Start' method is empty, while the 'Update' method is commented out. The code editor highlights the 'Start' method, and the user begins typing 'public static GameEvents current;' to declare a static variable. The user then adds a private void Awake() method, which assigns 'this' to the 'current' variable. Following this, the user declares a public event 'Action onDoorwayTriggerEnter' and adds a new method 'public void DoorwayTriggerEnter()'. The user then types 'if (onDoorwayTriggerEnter != null)' and 'onDoorwayTriggerEnter();' within the 'DoorwayTriggerEnter' method, indicating the intention to invoke the event if it is not null. The video concludes with the user adding a new line of code 'if (onDoorwayTriggerEnter != null)' and 'onDoorwayTriggerEnter();' within the 'DoorwayTriggerEnter' method, indicating the intention to invoke the event if it is not null.

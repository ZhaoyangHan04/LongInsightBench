The slide is set against a light background with a geometric design. The next frame transitions to a slide titled \"ELECTROLYTIC CELL,\" featuring a light gray background and a diagram of an electrolytic cell with an anode, cathode, anions, and cations. The slide explains that an electrolytic cell uses electrical energy from an external voltage source to drive a non-spontaneous redox reaction, converting electrical energy into chemical energy through electrolysis. The slide also lists the three elements of an electrolytic cell: 1 electrolyte and 2 electrodes, with the anode being the positive electrode where oxidation occurs and the cathode being the negative electrode where reduction occurs. The final frame adds a new point stating that electrolytic cells are only used for an external electrical potential of the correct polarity and large enough magnitude to decompose a normally stable or inert chemical compound in the solution. The video maintains a consistent light background and geometric design throughout, with the text and diagram providing educational content on electrolytic cells."

The background is a light pink color, and the diagram is detailed with labels and arrows to indicate the flow of electrons and the formation of gases.\n\nThe video then transitions to a computer screen displaying a similar diagram of the electrolytic cell, with the same labels and reactions. The computer screen is shown on a desk with a keyboard and a hand typing on it, suggesting that the diagram is being viewed or edited on a computer. The background remains consistent with the light pink color, and the text at the top of the screen reiterates the conditions for the reverse reaction to occur. The video concludes with the computer screen still visible, emphasizing the educational or instructional nature of the content, likely aimed at explaining the principles of electrolysis in a classroom or learning environment."

The text \"Why salt bridge is not used?\" appears, followed by the explanation \"As both anode and cathode are dipped in the same solution.\" The scene transitions to introduce the term \"Decomposition potential,\" which is highlighted in a pink box. The video then elaborates on this term, explaining that the minimum electromotive force (EMF) must be applied between the solution and electrode to continuously discharge the ions. It further details that the reverse reaction, the reduction of H+ by Cl2, is thermodynamically non-spontaneous and requires an input of 136V from an external power supply. The video concludes with a note on overpotential, defined as the difference between the theoretical cell voltage and the actual voltage necessary to cause electrolysis, often more than the theoretical value due to kinetic or surface effects. Throughout the video, the background remains white, and the pink question mark icon stays in the top left corner, maintaining a consistent visual theme."

It then delves into the concept of decomposition potential, explaining the minimum EMF required for continuous ion discharge and the non-spontaneous nature of the reverse reaction, which necessitates an external power supply. The term \"overpotential\" is introduced, defined as the difference between theoretical and actual cell voltages needed for electrolysis. The slide also mentions that sometimes reversing a reaction is impossible due to side reactions, exemplified by the reaction Zn + 2H+ -> Zn2+ + H2, where water breaks down to produce hydrogen instead of zinc in aqueous solutions. The background is white with pink geometric shapes, and the text is in black and red, with key terms highlighted in red.\n\nThe video then transitions to a new slide titled \"ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES of ELECTROLYTIC CELL,\" presented in a beige rectangle with white text. The background remains white with pink geometric shapes. A cartoon character, a girl with brown hair tied in a bun, wearing a purple shirt, appears on the left side of the frame. She is depicted in a thoughtful pose, with her hand on her chin and a thought bubble above her head containing a thumbs-up icon, indicating approval or satisfaction. The overall atmosphere is educational and informative, with a focus on explaining the pros and cons of electrolytic cells."

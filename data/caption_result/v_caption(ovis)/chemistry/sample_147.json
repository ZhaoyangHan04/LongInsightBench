The table is color-coded, with different colors representing different categories of elements. The word \"Periods\" is prominently displayed at the top center of the table, indicating the focus on the horizontal rows of the periodic table. The background is white, and the elements are organized into periods and groups, with the periods labeled from 1 to 7 and the groups labeled from 1 to 18. The video then transitions to a simplified version of the periodic table, where the elements are displayed in a more compact and less color-coded format. The background remains white, and the elements are arranged in a grid format, with the periods and groups still labeled. The word \"Periods\" is no longer visible in this frame. The video concludes with the simplified periodic table, emphasizing the arrangement of elements in periods and groups without the additional color-coding."

The individual places the filter paper on a black tabletop, which also holds a piece of paper with the word \"EXPERIMENT\" written on it, a blue bottle, and a metal stand with a clamp. The person then folds the filter paper into a cone shape and places it over a glass beaker. The beaker is positioned under a metal stand with a clamp, and the person carefully pours a liquid from the beaker through the filter paper, allowing the liquid to pass through while retaining any solid particles. The background features a sink, a faucet, and various laboratory equipment, including a white bottle and a poster on the wall. The scene is well-lit, and the focus is on the filtration process, highlighting the careful handling of the filter paper and the liquid being filtered."

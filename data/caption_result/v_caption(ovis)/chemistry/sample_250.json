The slide explains that all compounds containing these ions are soluble, with no exceptions. It also covers nitrates, chlorides, sulfates, carbonates, and hydroxides, detailing their solubility and exceptions. The slide concludes with a note that \"insoluble\" means a compound has an extremely low solubility in water (less than 0.01 M), and all ionic compounds have at least a very small solubility in water.\n\nThe video then transitions to a slide titled \"How water dissolves non-ionic (covalent) compounds.\" This slide explains that nonpolar covalent molecules, like hydrocarbons, do not dissolve well in water, while polar covalent molecules, like sugar, dissolve by hydrogen bonding. It mentions that when the nonpolar part of a molecule is considerably larger than the polar part, the molecule no longer dissolves in water easily. The slide includes an illustration of a molecule with hydrogen bonding, labeled \"methanol is more soluble in water than methane.\" The background of this slide is light blue, and the text is in black and blue, with the title in bold.

This is termed a \"split-brain scenario.\" The slide features a man in the bottom right corner, gesturing as he explains the issue. The background is a gradient of light blue, and the text is highlighted in yellow and orange for emphasis. The video then transitions to another slide with the same title, detailing the historical context of the NameNode as a single point of failure in HDFS clusters before Hadoop 2.0.0, highlighting the lack of automatic failover solutions. The man continues to gesture, emphasizing the points on the slide. The final part of the video presents a diagram titled \"HDFS NameNode HA Architecture,\" illustrating the components and interactions within the Hadoop HA architecture, including ZooKeeper, Quorum Journal Nodes, and Failover Controllers. The man remains in the bottom right corner, pointing to various parts of the diagram to explain the architecture. The background remains consistent with a light blue gradient, and the text is clearly visible, with key terms highlighted in yellow and orange. The video concludes with the man summarizing the diagram, ensuring the audience understands the HA architecture's components and their roles."

    "video_caption": "The video features a presentation slide discussing the \"Split Brain Issue\" in the context of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) NameNode High Availability (HA) architecture. The slide is divided into two sections: on the left, there is a textual explanation of the issue, and on the right, a diagram illustrating the HDFS NameNode HA architecture. The text explains that in a typical HA cluster, two separate machines are configured as NameNodes, with one in an Active state and the other in a Standby state. The Active NameNode handles all client operations, while the Standby NameNode maintains enough state to provide a fast failover if necessary. The diagram shows the components of the HDFS NameNode HA architecture, including the Active and Standby NameNodes, Quorum Journal Nodes, and DataNodes, along with their interactions and data flow. The slide also highlights the importance of the Standby node having up-to-date information regarding the location of blocks in the cluster to ensure a fast failover. The background of the slide is a gradient of blue shades, and there is a small image of a person in the bottom right corner, likely the presenter. The text is presented in bullet points, with key terms highlighted in bold for emphasis. The overall atmosphere of the video is educational, aimed at explaining technical concepts related to HDFS and HA architecture."

It details how to implement Fencing by adding a mechanism in the `hdfs-site.xml` file, with an example XML property snippet shown in a blue box. The text explains that the \"Fencing Method Name\" refers to scripts or Java classes used to fence the Active NameNode during a failover.

The presenter points to the code snippet, highlighting the property for the sshfence method and the format for specifying the user and port. The slide then transitions to another fencing method example, \"shell,\" which allows running an arbitrary shell command to fence the Active NameNode.

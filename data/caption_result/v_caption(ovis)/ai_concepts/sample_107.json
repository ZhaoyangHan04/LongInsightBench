The screen features a diagram illustrating a social network with interconnected nodes, each representing a user. The text on the screen explains that Twitter uses two approaches to find relevant tweets outside a user's network: Social Graph and Embedding Spaces. The Social Graph method estimates relevance by analyzing the engagements of people the user follows or those with similar interests using GraphJet, a Twitter's other Graph model. It generates candidate tweets based on recent engagements and ranks them using a logistic regression model. The man, dressed in a dark t-shirt, gestures with his hands as he elaborates on the topic, occasionally pointing to the screen to emphasize key points. The background is simple, with a plain wall and minimal distractions, focusing the viewer's attention on the presenter and the content on the screen.

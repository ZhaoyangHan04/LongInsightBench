The background is a plain, light gray gradient, providing a neutral backdrop for the figures. The scene then transitions to a Punnett square, a tool used in genetics to predict the outcome of a particular cross or breeding experiment. The square is divided into four quadrants, each containing a figure similar to those in the family tree, with two figures in purple and orange and two in solid purple. A percentage value of 75% appears in the center of the square, indicating the probability of a certain genetic trait being expressed. The Punnett square then changes to show a 100% probability, with all figures in the square now depicted in solid purple, suggesting a complete dominance of the trait. The video then shifts back to the family tree, now with an additional figure in solid purple, representing a new generation or a different genetic outcome. The final scene shows the family tree with an additional row of figures in solid purple, indicating a further progression in the genetic lineage. Throughout the video, the figures maintain their gradient color scheme, and the background remains consistent, emphasizing the focus on the genetic representation."

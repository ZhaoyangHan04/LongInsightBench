The slide features a book cover titled \"Anatomy and Physiology 2e\" by OpenStax, set against a white background with a colorful border. The scene transitions to a detailed diagram of the human eye, labeled \"VISION,\" illustrating the eye's anatomy and the process of light entering the eye and being converted into neural signals. The diagram includes labels for the iris, pupil, cornea, aqueous humor, lens, retina, optic nerve, and other components, with arrows indicating the path of light through the eye. The diagram also shows the layers of the retina, including ganglion cells, amacrine cells, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, rods, and cones, highlighting the sensory transduction process.

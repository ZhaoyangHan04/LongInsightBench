    "video_caption": "The video begins with a simple illustration of a balance scale against a black background, with the equation \"E=mc^2\" displayed above it. The left pan of the scale is labeled \"Energy\" and the right pan is labeled \"Mass,\" both in blue text, emphasizing the equivalence of mass and energy as described by Einstein's famous equation. The scene then transitions to a green can labeled \"Beans\" in red text, accompanied by the phrase \"Instant beans, just add energy!\" in white text above it. Below the can, a note in smaller white text reads, \"Note: you may not create beans.\" This humorous image plays on the concept of mass-energy equivalence, suggesting that adding energy to the can of beans could somehow create more beans, which is a violation of the law of conservation of mass. The video maintains a consistent black background throughout, keeping the focus on the text and illustrations."

The left pan is labeled \"Energy\" and the right pan is labeled \"Mass,\" both in blue text. The scene transitions to a drawing of a beaker filled with blue liquid, representing water, with text explaining that to heat a liter of water by one degree, 4.1813 joules of energy are needed. The video then introduces the concept of electron volts, stating that 1 electron volt equals 1.60217646 x 10^-19 joules. Following this, the video presents the mass of an electron in MeV (0.511 MeV), the mass of a proton (938.3 MeV), and the mass of a neutron (939.6 MeV), each accompanied by a colored dot. The final frame shows the mass of deuterium (1875.8 MeV), described as a hydrogen atom with a neutron in the nucleus, made from a proton and a neutron. The video maintains a consistent black background throughout, focusing on educational content related to energy, mass, and subatomic particles."

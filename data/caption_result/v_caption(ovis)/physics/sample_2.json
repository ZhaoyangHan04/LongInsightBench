It shows a wave with oscillations in multiple planes, representing unpolarized light, passing through a polarizing filter. The filter is depicted as a rectangular object with a vertical slit, allowing only the oscillations in a single plane to pass through, resulting in polarized light. The diagram includes a legend on the right side, explaining that unpolarized light oscillates in all planes around the direction of energy transfer, while polarized light oscillates in one plane around the direction of travel of the wave. The background is a plain light gray, and the diagram uses blue and red lines to differentiate between the unpolarized and polarized light waves. The video remains static, focusing on the educational content without any movement or changes in the scene."

    "video_caption": "The video showcases an interactive physics simulation titled \"Polarization of Light\" from oPhysics. The simulation features a graphical representation of light waves passing through two polarizing filters, depicted as red rectangles. The light waves are shown as green sinusoidal lines, with the filters positioned at different angles to demonstrate the effect of polarization. The interface includes options to \"Show Polarization\" and \"Show the Sun,\" with checkboxes for user interaction. The description below the simulation explains the concept of polarization, stating that the simulation is intended to help visualize the phenomenon. It mentions that a polarizing filter has a particular transmission axis and that the intensity of light passing through the filters depends on the angle between them. The video demonstrates the interaction between the light waves and the filters, showing how the intensity of the light changes as the filters are rotated. The background is a simple white interface with a navigation bar at the top, featuring categories such as \"Home,\" \"Kinematics,\" \"Forces,\" \"Conservation,\" \"Waves,\" \"E&M,\" \"Rotation,\" \"Fluids,\" \"Modern,\" \"Creating Tools,\" and \"Fun Stuff.\" The overall atmosphere is educational, focusing on the visualization of the physics concept."

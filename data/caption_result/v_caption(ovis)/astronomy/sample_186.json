The text on the slide states that the Moon has a diameter of about 3,500 km, which is roughly one-third of Earth's diameter. It explains that the Moon's rotation causes it to be slightly fatter around the equator, resulting in an oblate spheroid shape. The slide includes a visual representation of the Moon, emphasizing that the depicted shape is exaggerated and not noticeable to the naked eye. The text also notes that memorizing the Moon's size is unnecessary for GCSE exams, as it is provided in the exam factsheet. The background of the slide is white, with black text and a grayscale image of the Moon on the right side.

It mentions that when the Moon is full and at its closest point, it is called a supermoon. The slide includes a visual comparison between an average Moon and a supermoon, with the supermoon appearing larger. The text also notes that students do not need to memorize this information for the GCSE exam, as the distance to the Moon is provided in the exam factsheet.

The text explains that the Moon is a complex body with main features such as terrae, which are lighter regions called highlands where the crust is thicker. It mentions that terrae are generally older than maria and have more craters. The slide also notes that almost the entire far side of the Moon is terrae, with some lowlands covered by maria.

The slide includes a detailed description of the maria, explaining that they are lowland areas with thinner crusts, formed by the eruption of magma onto the surface and cooling. The maria are smoother than the surrounding terrain, with fewer craters, and are primarily composed of basalt. The slide also notes that maria no longer form on the Moon as the magma has cooled and solidified. Accompanying the text is an image of the Moon, highlighting the darker regions that represent the maria. Additionally, a note clarifies that while some maria are named oceans, such as the Ocean of Storms, the correct term for these dark features in the GCSE is \"maria\" or \"seas,\" not \"oceans.\" The slide maintains a consistent layout and design throughout the video, with no visible changes or movements between frames."

The next slide, also titled \"The Moon - Surface,\" introduces \"Rilles and wrinkle ridges,\" with images of Hadley Rille and unnamed wrinkle ridges. The text describes rilles as channels cut into the Moon's surface and wrinkle ridges as higher, elongated hills. The third slide, titled \"The Moon - Important Features,\" displays a labeled image of the Moon, highlighting seven specific features for GCSE identification: Kepler crater, Copernicus crater, Appenine mountains, Sea of Crises, Sea of Tranquility, Ocean of Storms, and Tycho crater.

The text elaborates on the concept of tidal locking, mentioning that most moons are tidally locked to their planets, and the Moon's rotation slowed down over time due to Earth's gravity. The slide also discusses the gravitational effects that cause the Moon to bulge at the equator and the eventual synchronization of its rotation and revolution. The background is plain white, and the text is in black, making it easy to read.

Accompanying text explains that the commonly believed 50% visibility is not entirely accurate due to the Earth's distance from the Moon. The text suggests that the closer one is to an object, the less of it can be seen, using the analogy of holding a football or a beach ball. The diagram shows a small blue circle representing Earth, with lines extending from it to the Moon, indicating the limited view from Earth. The background is white, and the text is in black, making it easy to read. The overall message of the video is to clarify the visibility of the Moon's surface from Earth, emphasizing that it is not exactly 50% due to the distance between the two celestial bodies."

The text on the left explains that due to the Earth's rotation and the Moon's elliptical orbit, observers at different latitudes on Earth can see varying portions of the Moon's surface. It mentions that people at the North Pole can see more of the Moon's North Pole, while those at the South Pole can see more of the Moon's South Pole. The text also describes the phenomenon of diurnal libration, where the Earth's rotation allows observers to see different sides of the Moon throughout the day. The slide emphasizes that this effect is called diurnal libration.\n\nThe video then transitions to another slide with the same title, \"The Moon – Libration.\" The text on the left side of the slide explains that the Moon's orbit is not perfectly circular but elliptical, which means its speed of revolution varies throughout its orbit. This variation allows observers to see different parts of the Moon around the edges at different times of the month, a phenomenon called libration in longitude. Additionally, the text mentions that the Moon's axis is tilted about 7 degrees, which sometimes allows observers to see past the North Pole and sometimes past the South Pole, a phenomenon called libration in latitude. The slide concludes by stating that overall, libration allows us to see 59% of the Moon's surface over time, but not all at once. The image of the Moon remains on the right side of the slide, providing a visual reference for the text."

The statue is positioned in front of a grand building, likely the Polish Academy of Sciences, as indicated by the text overlay. The text \"the Birth of Modern Astronomy\" and \"Statue of Nicolaus Copernicus outside Polish Academy of Sciences\" provides context to the scene, highlighting Copernicus's pivotal role in the development of modern astronomy. The scene then transitions to a detailed illustration of Copernicus's heliocentric model, \"De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium,\" alongside a portrait of Copernicus himself. The illustration features concentric circles representing the orbits of celestial bodies, with Copernicus's name and lifespan (1473-1543) displayed prominently. The accompanying text explains that this was the first mathematical heliocentric model, with Copernicus believing planets moved in perfect circles.

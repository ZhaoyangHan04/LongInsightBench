The study, conducted by researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder, involved 20 trained cyclists and a professional triathlete. The participants applied either a transdermal bicarbonate (TSB) lotion or a placebo lotion and completed various exercise and performance tests. The results showed higher lactate levels and other significant effects, supporting the lotion's ability to transdermally deliver sodium bicarbonate, potentially allowing athletes to avoid the side effects of oral bicarbonate use. The video then transitions to a person riding a bicycle on a dirt trail, with a graph overlay showing heart rate and perceived exertion (RPE) during a long-duration test. The scene shifts to a person standing in front of a wall adorned with cycling race placards, wearing a black t-shirt and a cap with the text \"Wilder Bikes.\" The video continues with a bar graph comparing blood lactate levels between the control and PR lotion groups, highlighting the study's results and the impact on the body. The final segment features cyclists riding on a road, with a graph overlay showing heart rate differences between the control and PR lotion groups. The video concludes with a cyclist riding on a road, with text stating that athletes who applied PR lotion displayed a significantly lower heart rate and lower level of perceived exertion at the 15-minute mark of a 1-hour time trial compared to the control group.

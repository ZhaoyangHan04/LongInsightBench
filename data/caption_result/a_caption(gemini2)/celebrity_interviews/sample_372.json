A person quotes someone else, stating that regardless of agreeing or disagreeing with Jackson Wang, he deserves credit for standing up for what he said, as his country of origin is allegedly being villainized by Western media. They express pride in him for speaking up, contrasting it with stereotypes about Asians. Afterward, another person questions the severity of the statements, summarizing that he merely pointed out an anti-China bias in Western media and suggested that visiting China might surprise people. The first person responds, suggesting the media attention was due to how he made the statements and that if he had used different language or wasn't drinking on stage, it would have been perceived differently.

The second speaker responds to this characterization, noting that it's not that big of a deal to him, apart from the format of the expression, and referring to the speaker's shirt.

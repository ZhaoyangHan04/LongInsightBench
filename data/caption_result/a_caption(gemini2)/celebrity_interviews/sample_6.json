He elaborates on the intended message, which was more about the opportunity 9/11 presented for corporations like Halliburton to gain oil contracts. He argues that the main point of the rally was not about left vs. right but rather about the fact that everyone has bought into the idea that conflict in the US is simply a matter of left and right."

The interviewer then questions the choice of portraying a fictional president with echoes of Trump, as opposed to using facts or other methods. The interviewee replies that the book is less about a specific individual and more a \"humorous lament\" about the culture, that leaders are results of that culture, and a \"cry for mutual accountability\"."

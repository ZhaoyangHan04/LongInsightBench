She confirms that she wears some kind of felt, then challenges him \"you want to do it again?\" He agrees eagerly. She suggests it's \"nice\" and he agrees and mentions that he would bring her \"some sunshine\", and that her dress is \"like a pool table.\" She laughs and confirms this. There's a brief pause, then he recounts being a bit scared to meet her, referencing a movie where she was violent, using an axe and the other responds with the fact that the characters were cut up into pieces. He suggests she seemed \"very adept\" at that, particularly praising the \"horse riding\", suggesting action or adventure content is being discussed."

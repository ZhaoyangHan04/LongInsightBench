She also discusses assumptions the public has made about his sexuality, noting that \"laying low for a while and then coming back with some new music and wearing dresses or pearl earrings from time to time kind of threw fans off.\" An audio clip with a male speaking thoughtfully is then played, where he states \"when you strip people down to basic human instinct, I think you get a lot of truth and a lot of natural reactions from people.\" The female speaker returns to the segment quoting an interview with The Guardian when Harry addresses whether he is bisexual, stating that \"it's not a case of I'm not telling you because I don't want to tell you, it's not oh this is mine and it's not yours. It's who cares? Does that make sense? It's just who cares.\" She then summarizes that they are unsure at the moment, but notes that \"Harry has been rocking some cute nail polish.\""

The female speaker denies this, stating she has \"no money problems\". The male speaker rephrases the question, and she reiterates \"no money problems whatsoever\". She then references \"Toni Braxton\" and states \"that's not me\". This conversational segment is suddenly interrupted by loud, rhythmic music that sounds like trap. The music is intense and overwhelming, potentially used for dramatic effect."

Who is the person you admire?

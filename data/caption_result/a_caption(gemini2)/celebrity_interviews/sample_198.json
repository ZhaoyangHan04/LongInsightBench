She adds that the interview allowed her to get some stuff off her chest. This is followed by a conversation between a man and a woman, discussing how cable news is not perceived as very different from the Daily Show. The man then jokes, \"I love that F-35,\" to which the woman responds, \"That wasteful engine bit, that killed him.\" Another female news anchor transitions by stating, \"That's ahead, please stay with us\". The clip then cuts abruptly to sounds of a cash register, followed by a man speaking what sounds like a news report."

The woman mentions Iraq and Bush, referring to the Delfer Report and weapons of mass destruction. The man responds, questioning if Bush changed his rationale or simply started discussing other reasons for the war. He mentions \"four rationales for the war,\" with the main one being fear, referencing Colin Powell and anthrax. The man points out that even in the Delfer Report, Saddam Hussein was trying to get around sanctions to reconstitute his weapons program, implying that the situation is not as straightforward. The woman appears to agree with the premise."

The male voice believes the reality is somewhere in between, saying the argument has not been that this is wrong for the country, and suggests it was a little more. The female says \"it's impassioned, certainly\", adding \"This is wrong for the country!\" The male voice disagrees with the idea that it was just wrong for the country, but that instead it was that \"you're a bad man.\" The woman says, that that isn't true. The male answers maybe. Finally, a female announcer says \"that could very well be, he says\". The announcer then says, \"Or,\" laughing, \"Yeah, there's more.\" She then asks the listener to stay with them for more of their interview."

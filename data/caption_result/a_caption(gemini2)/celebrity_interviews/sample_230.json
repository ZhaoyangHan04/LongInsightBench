The female asks about the male’s perspective on putting too much of himself into the music industry, since he started in his early twenties. The male responds, saying he always puts his all into anything he does. He shares he gave all his trust and love to the industry without considering what would happen if it didn’t work out, so when he hit a wall, it felt like a free fall. He then expresses regrets about maybe he should have stayed in school. He continues saying now he is smarter in terms of foundation and wants businesses instead of chasing dollars. The female acknowledges this sentiment. She then brings up how he recently faced music industry issues and the pain of another devastating loss."

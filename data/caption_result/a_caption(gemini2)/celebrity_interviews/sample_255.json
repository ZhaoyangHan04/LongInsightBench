We'll see.\" The second speaker, in an interview style, then inquires about the inspiration for the first speaker's songs, particularly their blues-rock influences, and asks about the creative process regarding music and lyrics. The first speaker responds, explaining that most of the time, the music comes first, and then he tries to tell a story within the song, though sometimes words come first. He emphasizes the importance of music and melody in his songwriting process. The second speaker follows up by asking if he has ever written a song that, in his opinion, is musically great but still needs work on the lyrics, or vice versa, and asks if his songs are works in progress. The first speaker replies, comparing song creation to preparing a meal, stating, \"You have to know when it's done. You know, you got to know when to stop adding stuff to it,\" and stresses the need to let go.  He adds that he is trying to create the best music he can in the moment.

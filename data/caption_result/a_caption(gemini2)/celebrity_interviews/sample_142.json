The music is abruptly cut off, and the female speaker summarizes that neither person has spoken out about the situation. However, she says April is trying to look unbothered and will keep doing her. The speaker discusses that they went through so much, fought for their love, even argued with Meek Mill in the shade room because everybody had something to say about their relationship. She says at the end of the day, they are grown, they can do what they want, smash who they want to smash, but the relationship was trifling. The woman states that the male involved was Omarian's band member and the female involved was his baby's mother, emphasizing certain lines you just don't cross. She hypothesizes that the pressure from people's opinions, especially negative ones, and those in the industry, strained their relationship. She concludes this is one of her thoughts."

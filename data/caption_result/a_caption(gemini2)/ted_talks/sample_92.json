A male speaker begins discussing futurist and entrepreneur Paul Saffo and his mantra, \"strong opinions weakly or loosely held\". The speaker explains this method, touching upon indecision, paralysis, and uncertainty that come with predicting the future. The speaker adds that Saffo's suggestion to test, amend, and refine ideas helps develop \"good predictive models\". He further explains that the intention is to develop a prediction, any prediction, with the understanding that it will be questioned, debated, and amended."

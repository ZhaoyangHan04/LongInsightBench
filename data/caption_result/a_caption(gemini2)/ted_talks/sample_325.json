The engine fades out as a male speaker enthusiastically begins with the claim, \"My next car gets 100 miles per gallon,\" and introduces himself as Joe Justice, a software consultant and member of Team Wiki Speed. In a professional, informative tone, he describes Team Wiki Speed's accomplishment of building a fast, affordable, efficient, and safe commuter car, noting the functional prototype's rapid construction in three months. A brief pause marks a shift to addressing how this is possible, given the slow rate of change in existing car designs, noting a six-year period resulting in only a 2 mile-per-gallon improvement. The speaker attributes this slowness to the high cost of changing manufacturing processes, noting the long investment periods for existing designs. The speaker states that these long development cycles are common in manufacturing teams."

The first of the two female speakers discusses growing up as two young women of color, how race was important in their lives, and how their schools rarely talked about the topic. After the summer of Eric Garner and Ferguson, they started to ask questions and realized they didn't know much about race. They started talking to random people in Princeton and asked them for stories about race to share on their website. The second female speaker mentions the website and that people were willing to open up and have intimate conversations. They feel it has to do with the fact that people don't have the opportunity to talk about race otherwise. Overall, both speakers speak in a conversational, thoughtful tone, and the general audio quality suggests a professionally recorded interview."

The speakers then reflect on their experience interviewing a large number of individuals, where they have realized how new stories continue to arise and they always have a chance to keep learning. Finally, the first speaker mentions interviewing a student named \"Ayoka\". The tone of their discussion is thoughtful and reflective."

The speaker seems impressed and shares this story in a clear, engaging, and descriptive tone. No music or background sounds are present in the clip."

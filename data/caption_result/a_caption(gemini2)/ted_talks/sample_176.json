A male speaker responds, stating that AI is coming of age and becoming more visible in everyday life. He gives examples, like Siri and Cortana, and businesses that use machine learning. Another male speaker chimes in, stating they are at the beginning of the AI revolution. He explains that computing power and data availability have recently allowed discoveries to happen, especially in the field of natural language. He anticipates a revolution in how we interact with machines, becoming more verbal and moving away from visual interfaces."

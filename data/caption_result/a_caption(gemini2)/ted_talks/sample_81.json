He mentions another experiment where those in a \"poverty condition\" were more likely to overborrow, taking high-interest loans that ultimately hurt their score, which could be explained by \"the advantages of wiggle room,\" and how the poverty condition limits options."

The speaker then thanks the listener for watching and encourages them to engage with the content, signing off with \"and don't stop thunking\". There's a musical tone at the end of the speech, possibly signaling the end of the message."

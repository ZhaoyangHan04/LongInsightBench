He shares a memory of a particularly intense rock paper scissors match with his brother at his parents' cottage, which eventually led to the creation of \"The World Rock Paper Scissors Society.\""

He then explains that he was left with the notion that there seemed to be more to the game than he initially thought and started a website, followed by a comment about what websites used to look like. The speaker defines gambits, relating them to rock, paper, scissors, and continues to describe how the game doesn’t leave much of a trace in anthropological records so they created the culture and history of rock, paper, scissors without the constraints of facts. He continues by noting that they took a lot of inspiration from communist and cultural revolution imagery, because people always had their fists out with the labor movement, speaking in a clear, informative tone throughout, frequently interrupted by laughter from an audience."

He describes how they exaggerated someone's importance to the media, the publication of an official strategy guide, and a documentary that won an award at Slamdance. The speaker jokingly shares that other countries began sending their champions and mentions how the ego of a Rock Paper Scissors champion is unbelievable. He said one of the hardest decisions he ever had to make was deciding whether Fox or ESPN should get the television rights. He also adds that Rock Paper Scissors is not as good of a televised sport as you might think it is. He speaks in an energetic and humorous tone, pausing for audience laughter. The general ambient noise in the background suggests a live audience."

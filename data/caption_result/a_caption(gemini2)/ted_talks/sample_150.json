He begins, in a calm, conversational tone, by noting how \"our lives all revolve around the internet.\" He then asks the audience, seemingly at a live event, \"How many of you go on Facebook...?\" and prompts a show of hands. Continuing, he asks further questions, such as \"How many of you here would not even remember your friend's birthdays if not for Facebook?\" and \"How many of you here watch YouTube more than you watch television now?\" seemingly emphasizing the influence of the internet in peoples' daily lives.

They pause for a moment before continuing, explaining that humor isn't anything new and that marketing is often trying to arouse emotions. However, in terms of crowdfunding, nobody really talks about it. The speaker then notes that you can't find a list of ten ways to be successful, with fun being one of the points. The speaker says that there are people bringing the \"fun back to funding.\" The female speaker finishes with a short \"okay.\""

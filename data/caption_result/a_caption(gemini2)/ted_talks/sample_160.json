He continues, adopting an excited tone, describing the impact of entrepreneurs and a new generation of people on the space industry. He says \"a new space race is here.\" Describing his company, he says it was formed a couple of years ago to participate in a massive revolution in space. He then explains the \"microsatellite disruption,\" contrasting old satellites with modern ones that are smaller, cheaper, and faster to develop. The speaker concludes by stating that this has drawn in investors and a new generation of people, making the space race a reality."

He explains their business strategy involves using small launch vehicles and building a \"constellation of software defined satellites\". According to the male speaker, users will program it \"like you would a cellphone with apps.\" He mentions that reducing the size of a rocket drastically cuts costs and compares their Vector rockets to the rockets that went to the moon, reducing the cost from \"a billion and a half dollars to launch\" to \"one and a half million\" for their rockets."

He highlights the difference of building these rockets in large numbers, drawing a parallel to automotive technology and stating they are doing the \"opposite\" of taking rocket technology to cars. He notes the mass production of these rockets, and aims to produce and fly them by hundreds. This, he claims, allows the rockets to be cheaper and creates more profit. He concludes by referencing Henry Ford's Model T as an inspiration."

He continues, mentioning a suborbital altitude flight and its recovery from the jungle as proof of their systems' functionality. The speaker outlines a gradual development approach and mentions upcoming first flights to orbit this July from a Virginia flight facility. The sound of speech is in a public setting with light background noise that is consistent and unobtrusive."

She speaks of her thesis topic relating to youth radicalization and recruitment in Tunisia and Kenya. Then she shares a personal story about her cousin's radicalization and their attempts to deradicalize him. She then begins to express her perspectives on the issue, stating there are states that project fear to justify treating young people as terrorism suspects. She questions whether deradicalization policies are furthering youth radicalization, and if the UN's strategy is giving states a free hand to violate youth rights. She feels that the state response to terrorism is typically retributive, resulting in collective punishment of young people."

The group will be talking about \"the Illustrated Malcolm Gladwell\" and welcomes the listener to the episode. The speaker asks \"why an illustrated Malcolm Gladwell?\". A male voice answers, explaining that he felt like these books deserved to be thought about from a design perspective with the same care that is given to the storytelling. He states that Malcolm should be able to put \"this thing on the table and have that be\" something, referring to \"Plunk failure,\" and then corrects to \"Plunk value\"."

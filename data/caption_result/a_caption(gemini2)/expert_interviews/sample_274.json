Before proceeding, he asks the listeners to subscribe to the channel if they like the videos and to leave comments to improve the quality. The clip concludes by beginning the explanation of the split brain problem."

He provides a historical context of Hadoop architecture, mentioning that before Hadoop 2, the name node was a single point of failure, with no automatic failover mechanism. Then he describes how the concept of two name nodes was brought in, one active and one passive, as a standby, and that it will take over in failover scenarios. He also introduces the concept of general nodes for maintaining a quorum and sharing namespace and metadata information between the two name nodes, active and passive."

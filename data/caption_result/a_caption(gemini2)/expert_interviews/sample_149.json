He elaborates that the characters and story took on a life of their own. The interviewer clarifies whether the speaker was completely under the characters' influence, which the first speaker dismisses, explaining it was more like having a sense that one option out of many must be right and needing to wait to find out which one. This spoken portion is interjected with continuous background static."

He explains that everything is declining and fading toward the end of the Third Age and that every choice tends to upset tradition. The speaker then questions where God is in The Lord of the Rings, and the other speaker says He is mentioned once or twice. A question is posed about whether he is the one. He confirms. He identifies himself as a Roman Catholic. He expresses that he would wish to be remembered chiefly for his writings on philology and other matters, or by The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. The speaker says, I should have thought that I, it's a situation to be remembered by The Lord of the Rings. He adds that it would be like being remembered by Longfellow, but they remember Longfellow writes Hiwatha and people forget he was a professor of modern languages."

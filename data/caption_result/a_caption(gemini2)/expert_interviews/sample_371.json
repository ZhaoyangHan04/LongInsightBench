She points out that critical care admissions and cases are younger than 70 and that many people suffer from long COVID, which is not fully understood. She questions accepting deaths from a disease that could adapt and threaten vaccine response over elimination, emphasizing that it makes no sense to her, given many countries. A male voice briefly interrupts, questioning whether COVID can be eliminated."

A male speaker disagrees, countering with Australia as an example, stating they have eliminated it so far, but it could come back anytime, especially as borders reopen and people start going on holidays. The male speaker's tone is conversational and slightly skeptical. The conversation seems to be happening in a fairly quiet environment."

She summarizes the scientific community's view in the UK, arguing against \"living with it\" and accepting deaths and morbidity from an incompletely understood disease.

He argues the risk lies more in external mixing associated with schools being open, rather than the school environment itself. The first female speaker responds, citing Public Health England surveillance data that shows an equal number of outbreaks in primary and secondary schools."

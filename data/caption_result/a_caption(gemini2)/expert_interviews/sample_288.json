She speaks in an informative and articulate manner, emphasizing that through science, people can agree on evidence that illustrates a hypothesis, and if evidence contradicts the hypothesis, it must be abandoned. She notes the importance of considering all relevant evidence from various sources and striving for objectivity. Ultimately, she concludes that science is a \"fundamentally useful, accurate, and universal\" method for understanding the world."

She states that ideas must be published in a transparent way, so that others can criticize whether the hypothesis is correct. She then explains that a scientist has no better friend than \"valid critics.\" She suggests that if criticisms lead to the abandonment of a hypothesis because facts don't fit the idea, then the hypothesis must be abandoned and replaced with something more adequate."

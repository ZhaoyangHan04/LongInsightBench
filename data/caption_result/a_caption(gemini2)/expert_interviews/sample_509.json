This music gradually fades as a female speaker begins to talk about her work at the CNRS in France, specifying that she works at an institute near Paris. She describes her main scientific interest as radio transients and SETI research, explaining that her job is 100% research-based, although she enjoys working with students. As she elaborates on her contributions to academic life, including her role as a co-chair in the SKA Science Working Group, the electronic instrumental music returns, signaling the end of her narration."

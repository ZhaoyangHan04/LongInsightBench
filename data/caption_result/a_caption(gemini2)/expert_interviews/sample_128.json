Then, a male speaker begins, stating that stepping outside the \"accepted academic narrative\" will bring \"heat,\" and emphasizes that \"something happened, and it was significant.\" This shifts to a more conversational male voice explaining that they're talking about \"truths.\" They mention being trusted to work at the Pentagon after 9/11 and being assigned by the government to do that work. Finally, a cheerful female voice introduces herself and her companion, welcoming viewers and asking for introductions and the speakers' work. An electronic sound then cuts the end of the clip."

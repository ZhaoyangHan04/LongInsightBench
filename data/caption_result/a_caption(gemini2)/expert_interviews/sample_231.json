The music fades as a male news anchor begins speaking in a clear and professional tone. He introduces a study on Alzheimer's and dementia, mentioning Dr. Kenneth Rockwood's involvement. A second male speaker, presumably Dr. Rockwood, responds, \"Big day, thanks very much,\" sounding appreciative. The news anchor then shifts the focus to differentiating between Alzheimer's and dementia, continuing the conversational tone."

He continues, mentioning that in North America, the people typically impacted by Alzheimer's and dementia are those over the age of 65. He states that it is a disorder uncommon under 65, but affects one in two or one in three people over the age of 85.  He then says that dementia is on the rise and that it's a problem because the population is aging, and that the prevalence of dementia is rising in lockstep with the aging of the population. He concludes his explanation by agreeing to explain \"non-traditional factors.\""

Another male speaker responds, focusing on the message to the general public about maintaining good health to lower the risk of late-life dementia and the importance of physical exercise. He then transitions to discussing a message for the scientific community about the accumulation of small bad things increasing risks, and paying attention to how the brain repairs itself, suggesting a faulty repair mechanism could be the cause of Alzheimer's disease. He finishes by stating they're trying to communicate two messages: to pay attention to aberrant repair response and to how small things add up. The first male speaker then asks about the sample and time frame of the study."

He shares that they looked at high blood pressure, cholesterol, and other things as risks, and they helped to establish the current understanding. He explains that they started over and threw out everything they knew, and used things that couldn’t possibly be related to the risk of Alzheimer's to draw attention that there must be something else going on. A man then asks him how many people were involved and how long it took. The speaker replied, \"So, this was a mountain of work.\" Then, a different man said you know you’re onto something big when you do a ton of media. He said that the man has been talking to reporters all day long, like the New York Times. The man replied the New York Times, CNN, and USA Today. The man then asks what it tells him that the world is so anxious to buy into the study so quickly, and get this information out there."

He describes it as a \"fascinating find\" that touches many people. Then he is thanked and responds in kind. The clip concludes with news jingle music and an outro message."

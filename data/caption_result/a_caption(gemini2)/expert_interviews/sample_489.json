A male speaker responds by saying \"why do I say free software rather than open source\". He describes the difference between the terms and explains that the open source camp seeks to make companies and corporations more comfortable with free software. He continues saying, that \"open source is all about various compromises and trade-offs\" to appeal to corporate interests, which he feels is important for corporate investment, backing, and encouragement. He adds it has been \"enormously important to the growth of the free software and open source phenomenon\", naming \"IBM, HP, Intel, Sun and others\". To conclude, the man believes \"this is a healthy and natural part of the IT landscape,\" so he thinks that is good."

He expresses that these contributors are \"motivated and inspired\" by things such as the empowerment derived from the rights attached to the software, and the ability to improve it. He feels this is also true not only for \"people who are software developers\", because you never know how someone might contribute. He brings up memes."

The speaker also shares the realization that trying to narrow Debian's scope and focus would take away from its essential value, akin to limiting the Linux kernel's focus.

He defines agonists and antagonists in relation to receptors. The speaker then provides an example of nicotine as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist and the conflicting signals that arise due to its effect on both sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent fibers."

He uses blood vessels as an example, stating that they are only innervated by sympathetic efferent fibers. He then says, \"one of the effects of nicotine in the body is to increase blood pressure.\" He connects this to smoking or nicotine consumption, stating it can increase blood pressure and risk of cardiovascular disease. Finally, there is a single-syllable filler word: \"yeah.\" His tone is conversational and informative."

    "audio_caption": "The audio features a single male speaker explaining the difference between somatic and germ cells in mammals. He defines somatic cells as forming internal organs, skin, bones, blood, and connective tissue. Germ cells, he says, give rise to spermatozoa and ova, which fuse during fertilization to create a zygote, which then divides and differentiates into the cells of an embryo. His tone is informative and educational."

He notes that species with a separation between sterile somatic cells and germ line are called Weissts. The speaker's tone is informative and academic. He explains that Weisst development is relatively rare, as many species have the capacity for somatic embryogenesis. Then there is a short musical interlude which features a light piano melody, setting a neutral tone, leading back into the speaker saying genetics and content."

An example is provided of modern cultivated wheat which is a hexaploid species with somatic cells containing six copies of every chromatid."

A sudden shift occurs as dissonant, electronic music begins, creating a stark contrast to the calm speech. The music features prominent, distorted electronic sounds, suggesting a dark or unsettling mood.

Next, a female speaker provides instructions, starting with \"take a glass of water\", describing an experiment using ink and water. Initially, she notes, \"the drop of ink is separately visible from the water,\" and that the interface between the ink and water is distinct. The female speaker then speaks in a slightly lower tone and a percussive clanking sound occurs."

As a result, ink molecules start moving towards water molecules, or in other words, they \"spread out into the water.\" She concludes by stating that \"this spreading out takes place from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.\""

Then, the same female speaker mentions that, because of constant motion, a few molecules of water also move towards the molecules of ink, but that the number is less. The speaker concludes that the interface between ink and water becomes less distinct."

Finally, the speaker concludes by returning to the perfume example, explaining how constituent molecules diffuse into the air in a room, allowing the fragrance to be smelled everywhere. Throughout the clip, the speaker has a clear and informative tone."

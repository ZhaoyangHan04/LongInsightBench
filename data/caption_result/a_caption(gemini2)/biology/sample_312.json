The speaker mentions their widespread occurrence in wet or damp environments and their presence in the rotting mashed potatoes of a culture. The speaker describes observing the creatures in diluted medium, identifying spherical potato bits and the worms' distinct wriggling motion, allowing for immediate identification even at low magnification. This is then followed by a brief period of silence and then an instrumental musical clip."

He describes the anterior end as blunt, pointing out the pharynx with muscle concentrations or bulbs used for sucking in bacteria-rich fluids. Continuing to describe the anatomy of the male nematode, the speaker notes a bulge at the posterior end, the cloaca, from which the anus and male gonopore open. He mentions copulatory spicules that males use to transfer sperm to females. The speaker then references another male with more visible spicules and points out that a dead individual's copulatory spicules are easily seen sticking out. The clip concludes with the male speaker wondering if viewers want to see more."

When the copepod is ingested by a fish, the L3 stage infects the fish, molting into L4 and then an adult. The adults mate and the cycle starts over. He continues, showing examples of L1 juveniles just released from their mother, and showing L1s happily living in their new home, the copepod Tigriopus Californicus. Next, he describes that the long, skinny tail of the juvenile will change in shape at the molt from L2 to L3. He continues, showing L2s in the copepod who are eating and larger than L1s. He then shows an L2 about ready to molt into L3. Finally, he describes L3s, explaining that they have two-pronged posterior ends and a distinctive morphology of the anterior end."

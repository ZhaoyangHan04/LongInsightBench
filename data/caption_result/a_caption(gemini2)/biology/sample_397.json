Then, a male voice begins to speak with an informative tone, discussing sheep and goats as livestock in India, their contribution to the economy, and their role in farmers' livelihoods. He describes the domestic sheep, \"Ovis aries,\" as a quadrupedal ruminant mammal. This is followed by a second, female voice continuing the description, defining sheep as even-toed ungulates. The male voice returns, adding that sheep are raised for their meat, milk, and wool. He distinguishes sheep from goats by their structure and scent glands.

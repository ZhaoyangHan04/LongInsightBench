A friendly and informative female speaker then begins, introducing herself and referencing \"a turtle,\" then questioning whether the listener can discern its sex. She continues to say that a recent paper identified a new way to determine the sex of baby turtles using a western blot, which can be helpful for conservation. The music fades out, leaving only speech."

She highlights that climate change, leading to imbalanced sex ratios, poses a threat to endangered turtle species, potentially leading to extinction. The speaker ends with a question."

She continues explaining that \"a Western blot is a lot like gel electrophoresis\" and scientists use an electric current to separate proteins on a gel, but with antibodies to detect proteins of interest."

The speaker points to a Western blot from the research paper, explaining that it is interpreted similarly to DNA gels with \"fatter bands\" indicating more protein in the sample, and mentions how bands are visualized differently from gel electrophoresis, before trailing into the need to understand how the Western blot works. The speaker is conversational and friendly. Finally, a brief, jazzy tune with piano and drums plays, creating a playful atmosphere."

    "audio_caption": "The audio clip begins with a female speaker explaining that electrophoresis is essentially the same as gel electrophoresis, but is called \"sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.\" A whooping sound is then heard. The speaker mentions that it's usually shortened to SDS PAGE. The speaker continues discussing electrophoresis, explaining that the gel is made out of polyacrylamide. They then discuss SDS PAGE, explaining that the SDS part of SDS PAGE comes from the detergent that scientists add to the protein sample. The speaker explains how negatively charged molecules move through the gel and how SDS is negatively charged. The speaker explains that SDS sticks to all types of proteins, making sure each protein is negatively charged. The speaker then explains that after the gel has run, you cannot see the proteins and that if you were running a DNA gel, you could add a dye that binds to DNA to see where the bands are. The speaker mentions that you can do this with an SDS PAGE gel, called doing a Coomassie stain, but it will show you all of the proteins in the sample, not just the one you are looking for. Gentle, playful piano music is played in the background throughout the entirety of the speech."

Then, the audio transitions to light, piano-based music, which is gentle in tone, and a woman's voice explains why Western blots are called Western blots, suggesting this is a play on words. The speaker refers to another scientist named Edwin Southern who invented a similar method. The speaker also explains that scientists call Western blots \"immunoblots\" or \"immunoassays.\""

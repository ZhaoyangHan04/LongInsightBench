The speaker discusses innervation from the autonomic nervous system and the form of the cells, and refers to a cross section of an artery in a picture, mentioning the adipose tissue around smooth muscle cells, and describing other details such as plasma, red blood cells, and elastic connective tissue. She concludes by noting how smooth muscle cells look like cells, particularly when compared to other muscle types."

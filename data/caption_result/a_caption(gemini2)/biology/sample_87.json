She names examples of animals, such as a bear, a snake, a jellyfish, spiders and humans, and also mentions the animal kingdom as multicellular eukaryotes. The speaker proceeds to mention that animal evolution began about 600 million years ago. Overall, the speaker speaks in a clear and professional tone."

The speaker then talks about animals having specialized connective tissue, and the functions that they provide, for example, transport and structural support."

Following this, the word \"action\" is clearly stated."

She mentions budding and fragmentation, providing the example of a piece that can be separated and grow into a new individual. She continues by stating that some fish, amphibians, and reptiles may exhibit these processes. Afterwards, she references a chart, mentioning a phylogenetic tree of an animal based on morphological, fossil, and genetic data. In the background, there's a brief vocalization, possibly a cough."

The audio clip concludes with a short, quiet sound, possibly a breath."

She describes asymmetrical animals like sponges that lack symmetry, then moves on to radial symmetry as seen in jellyfish, and finally bilateral symmetry in humans, where a vertical plane divides the body into mirror images. A short \"click\" sound then occurs, presumably to stop the recording."

    "audio_caption": "The clip begins with a female speaker who introduces the concept of embryonic development, influencing an animal's appearance. She explains that during embryonic development, cells reorganize into germ layers. She notes that bilaterally symmetrical animals have three germ layers, while radially symmetrical animals have two, with each layer developing into specific tissues and organs. She lists the three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, before describing the ectoderm's development into the central nervous system, epidermis, and hair.  She continues to specify the formation of the stomach, liver, lungs, and intestines by the endoderm, along with the mesoderm's role in providing red blood cells and bone tissue. She moves on to mention diploblasts with two germ layers and triploblasts with three germ layers, followed by the internal body cavity, the coelom, which forms from the mesoderm. Lastly, she mentions that annelids and nematodes each have a body cavity lined by the mesoderm tissue, giving them a gut and a coelom."

Then, the same female voice shifts to describing platyhelminths, highlighting their bilateral symmetry and triblastic layer. Subsequently, she mentions the nervous cords and ganglion that are present in this group. Continuing the same pattern of reading with a factual tone, she explains that nematodes, also called roundworms, are parasitic and have tapered bodies with a complete digestive system. Finally, she states that they are usually present on the ocean floor and may be monoecious or dioecious, resembling long tubes."

She begins with the plant-like protists, naming unicellular and multicellular examples, and describing the kelp as a type of brown algae. She notes that algae are plant-like, but not actual plants, sharing characteristics such as being photosynthetic and having cell walls. She emphasizes that they lack the true body of a plant with differentiated leaves, stems, or roots. She ends by mentioning euglena, a plant-like protist with the best of both worlds."

They have digestive vacuoles or food vacuoles that break down food with enzymes. She continues with further information about these categories."

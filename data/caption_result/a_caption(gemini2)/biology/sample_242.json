We hear that Ted Jones is visiting a laboratory at the City Health Department, where his brother Frank is a bacteriologist. Then, we hear the sound of microscope adjustment knobs, indicating Ted is trying to focus. Frank, a male, offers advice in a helpful and guiding tone: \"Try using the fine adjustment knob and do it more slowly\".  Ted, also a male, replies that he is, and then excitedly exclaims, \"Say, here they are!\". Frank sounds pleased, asking, \"You know what kind they are?\". Ted responds, \"No\", and Frank explains, \"Then they're one of the kinds of bacteria that causes food to spoil\". The narrator then summarizes the scene: Ted has just seen one of the many kinds of bacteria. The music swells again at the end."

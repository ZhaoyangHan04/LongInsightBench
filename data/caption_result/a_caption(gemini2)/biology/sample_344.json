He defines vision as the ability to detect light patterns and interpret them into images. He specifically describes how light is detected by photoreceptor cells in the retina and differentiates between rods and cones. The rods give black and white vision while the cones."

The speaker continues, highlighting the unusual nature of this transduction mechanism, where detecting the stimulus leads to a decrease in neurotransmitter release, contrasting it with other examples where the stimulus causes depolarization and increased neurotransmitter release. The clip ends with a verbalized hesitation, \"um\"."

In contrast, processing in the \"ventral stream\" involves the \"temporal lobe\" and is focused on identifying objects in the visual field. The clip concludes with silence."

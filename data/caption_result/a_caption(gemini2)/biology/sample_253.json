He explains that leptin is a hormone released from adipose tissue, normally signaling the brain to decrease food intake. He describes it as \"part of a normal homeostatic loop.\" The speaker then contrasts this process with individuals who cannot make leptin, such as \"individual OB1 and OB2,\" noting they cannot suppress their appetite, leading to continuous food intake and weight gain. He maintains a clear, informative tone throughout."

He mentions how these genes function in a similar way and are associated with appetite control, referring to a neural signaling pathway in the brain and describing how various signals act to reduce appetite. He concludes that impairment of these genes could result in overeating. The speaker emphasizes the connection between the regulation of appetite and genetics of obesity risk."

He contrasts this approach with connecting family trees, explaining how it involves analyzing DNA from cases and controls to find associations between specific DNA variants and obesity risk. The speaker states over 100 genetic locations have been identified, mentioning a few variants that overlap with pedigree analysis findings, such as melanocortin receptor, leptin receptor, and BDNF.

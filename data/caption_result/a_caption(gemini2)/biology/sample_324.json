He explains that bones form through \"ossification\" or \"osteogenesis\", which means the making of bone. He continues by describing bone formation during various developmental stages and bone replacement. Finally, he mentions that growth also occurs during fracture repair."

He maintains a factual tone. He outlines steps in matrix hardening, describing the formation of trabeculae and spongy bone, mentioning the spaces within spongy bone that support blood vessels and red bone marrow. The speaker continues to discuss the fusion of trabeculae in spongy bone and emphasizes the availability of space for blood vessels and marrow formation, his tone remaining informative."

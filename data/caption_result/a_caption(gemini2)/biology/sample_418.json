She explains that she is going to open up the right side of the heart. She mentions two veins, the superior and inferior vena cava, and notes that the vessels feed into the right side of the heart."

    "audio_caption": "A female speaker begins by describing how she is cutting along the probe to open up the right atrium. She notes that it's a small chamber, essentially an entrance into the heart for blood entering the right side. She proceeds to cut down along the edge of a wrinkle toward the apex to open up the right ventricle, explaining she will turn the heart upside down to do so. During this speech, her tone is instructional and deliberate. As she describes the apex, she reminds the audience that the right side of the heart does not include it, as it is part of the left ventricle."

She notes the ventricle's wall is thicker because it's a \"stronger pump\" compared to the thinner atrium wall. Throughout her explanation, the speaker maintains a factual and descriptive tone."

She notes that the valve is made of a thin but strong material and prevents backflow, calling it the tricuspid valve. The speaker also describes \"string-like structures\" called chordae tendineae which prevent the valve from inverting. She finishes by mentioning the papillary muscles which hold the chordae tendineae in place. Her speaking tone is informative and matter-of-fact."

She mentions needing to \"flip the heart over.\" She identifies the \"pulmonary trunk\" on the right side of the heart, and demonstrates how she is going to \"put the probe down into the pulmonary trunk\" to show how it attaches to the right ventricle. She flips the heart over again, observing that \"that probe does in fact connect to the right ventricle\" and that the vessel that she found \"carries blood from the right ventricle up towards the lungs.\" Her tone is informative and descriptive throughout."

This transitions into a podcast-like segment with two male speakers. One introduces himself as Jimmy, identifies the other as Jake, and announces their segment, \"The Weekly Dumb.\" Jimmy asks Jake about his weekend, implying he was \"dancing and being dumb.\" Jake mentions going to Brooklyn, stating, \"Where Brooklyn at?\" in a casual tone, and describes looking at apartments. He comments on having an \"okay weekend.\" Jimmy asks if Jake walked over the Brooklyn Bridge, which Jake did not do, but concedes people talk about it. Jimmy agrees people talk about it, and then asks Jake how he is doing. The exchange ends abruptly with the first speaker directing them to move on and discuss things people like to hear them talk about, followed by the same funky music from the beginning."

The conversation concludes with a brief statement about baseball traditions."

A short instrumental musical piece then begins, it's upbeat and features string instruments and percussion, creating an adventurous mood. Steve begins describing how to put a knocking point, including necessary materials like arrows, thread, and a bow square. He explains the process using precise instructions and measurements, referencing the lines on his bow square and aiming for a starting point of eight millimeters. During the explanation, the music fades slightly to the background but continues playing intermittently. Steve explains he's going to begin with a knocking point at 8, and it's his starting point to see where he needs to put his knocking point, then test it to see what works best. He reiterates that he will start with knocking."

    "audio_caption": "The audio features a male speaker providing instructions, beginning with \"You're gonna need two small pieces of thread,\" likely for a demonstration. He speaks in a clear, instructional tone, explaining how to start with the bottom knocking point. He then tells the listener that they need to take the bow square off to make small knots, because his current knot is not perfect. He advises making three or four small knots, and specifies that he is done for now. Next, he says that the listener will need an arrow, and puts it on. He instructs the listener to press against the knock, putting it all the way down until the knocking point."

He then mentions needing a knife to cut the pieces off."

He then advises to take the lighter and burn the small pieces off, emphasizing the importance of turning the bow to avoid damaging the serving. Following this, he states his intention to set up the bow and shoot at 30 m to assess their accuracy. The clip concludes with the distinct sound of multiple arrow shots being fired."

He describes how his arrows are not grouping tightly and that his bare shafts are lower than the group. He states that he needs to move the nocking point lower and redo it at \"6\" to use as a reference. He then explains how to cut the serving properly, saying, \"you have to put the flat side of your knife against the serving\" to make straight cuts. In the background, there are consistent light sounds, possibly indicating some kind of activity is taking place during this process. Lastly, there's the distinct sound of an impact or thud which suggests a practical demonstration, perhaps related to his explanation."

Soon after, distinct clipping sounds are heard, suggesting the use of clippers, which then fade out, ending the audio."

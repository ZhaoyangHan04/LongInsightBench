The tone is conversational and analytical. Another male voice joins, agreeing and mentioning the need to assess players' health and shooting ability, and adding that Frank has been shooting well from 3 this year. The first speaker agrees, but it needs to continue to knock down shots. A female speaker then passionately questions how much longer they should give Frank to prove himself, criticizing the perceived differences in expectations compared to another player, RJ, and expressing frustration over Frank's unclear role and lack of contribution after four years."

Another male, Jail, says, \"all I have to say is this, man\"."

A second male voice says \"yours is leaking, big time.\" The first voice mentions a \"good noise,\" and the second replies, \"Okay,\" followed by a popping sound. A person coughs, and the first voice says \"Okay, from the top, from the\" before being interrupted. The second speaker introduces himself, and the first says \"Here we go, Zach, like, let's hello!\" to which the second speaker replies, \"I've been ready.\" Following this is a series of vocal sounds, resembling a series of vocal utterances. Then, one of the speakers begins to talk in an enthusiastic tone, indicating that they are fired up about baseball week and opening day, but first, he asks what happened in basketball, indicating a shift in topics."

He then mentions UCLA's win over Alabama, highlighting Alabama's poor free-throw performance. Another male speaker chimes in, joking about the possibility of doing better than Alabama's free-throw percentage. The first speaker confidently affirms that he could do better but would feel pressured to perform. The second speaker then notes Michigan's victory over Florida State, shifting the topic to Gonzaga, an undefeated team perceived as annoying by the first speaker. The second speaker suggests that teams from that specific region of the U.S. can’t be America’s darling. To this statement, the first speaker suggests that Oregon could be considered America’s darling and the other speaker then retracts that teams from that region are America’s darling “besides the Oregon Ducks”. They agree that Gonzaga is merely everyone's second favorite team. The clip concludes with a short, upbeat baseball-themed jingle accompanied by the sound of maracas."

A male voice is then heard rating the name Wesley Bryan on a scale, giving it a low score, implying it's a bad name, followed by laughter. The conversation takes a playful, teasing turn, and then transitions to a snippet of music, possibly blues, with a playful, somewhat melancholic tone, featuring guitar and a harmonica. During the music, one of the men says \"spit on me Daddy,\" then a transition back to a man saying \"think I'll have myself a beer\", ending on a concluding phrase \"more sports\"."

Next, he describes an unwritten rule of refereeing, ending his statement with a crude imitation of Yosemite Sam. Afterward, what sounds like glass tapping or jingling is audible, likely a small, quick background noise that punctuates the discussion. He then prompts a transition to \"not sports\"."

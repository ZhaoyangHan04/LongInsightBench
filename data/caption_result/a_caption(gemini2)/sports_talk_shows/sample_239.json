Continuing, the speaker describes Curry's teammates and rivalries, mentioning names like Harrison Barnes and Chris Paul. The tone is thoughtful, almost analytical, as the speaker asserts that looks can be deceiving, and continues by quoting Matt Barnes on other players' animosity toward Steph, then introduces the voices of another male, with real talk affirmations and of a female. Transitioning, the speaker summarizes the reasons for players' feelings about Steph, highlighting the embarrassment, and the smile of a \"true killer.\" Finally, a male voice, presumably Magic Johnson, emphasizes Curry's unique shooting abilities. Underlying the speech, there is a recurring soundtrack, consisting of subdued trap music with a determined tone, which adds intensity to the discussion."

The speaker laments WWE's lack of interest in giving James a substantial role, citing her release and disrespectful sendoff via a trash bag, which sparked online backlash. This poor treatment of a great female talent resulted in the firing of the responsible individual and public apologies from Triple H and Stephanie McMahon. The scene then transitions to the next \"pointless comeback,\" with the speaker introducing another wrestler. Throughout this, a low, ambient background buzz is audible."

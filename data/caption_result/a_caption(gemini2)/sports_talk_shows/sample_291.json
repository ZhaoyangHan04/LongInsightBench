Kobe says he enjoys it and prepares for it by thinking strategically and putting guys in the right place, adding that his idol was Magic, followed by a joking \"I just happened to not grow to 6'9\".\" Another male speaker inquires whether Kobe really wanted to be a point guard. Kobe responds that if he's serious, he would have been the best. This is followed by laughter, and then the same male speaker asks what his strengths would have been. Kobe concludes by saying that when he's focused on something, he becomes obsessed with it and wants to be perfect at it, and that's his personality.

Another male voice chimes in to ask, \"12 viewers, you mean?\" with a slightly sarcastic tone.\n\nThe first speaker then says that the ability of smaller, more skilled players to thrive like Steph Curry has been compromised in the past, concluding that he doesn't think that a league where guys could bang him and knock him to the ground would be a better brand of basketball. This portion is delivered with a thoughtful and measured tone. \n\nA female voice interjects, commenting on a statement made by Adam Silver, saying that he \"essentially just told us casuals that Stephen Curry wouldn't survive in the '90s.\" She observes, \"What a hot take, my guy,\" her tone is sarcastic.\n\nShe notes the irony that \"even in the modern age\" of basketball, physicality still ramps up in the playoffs. She adds that Silver's statement \"ignorantly disregards\" the fact that Steph has been able to make up for his lack of height with his amazing three-point prowess."

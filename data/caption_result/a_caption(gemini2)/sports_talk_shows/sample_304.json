He then pivots to mentioning that the size of a jug may affect how someone positions their hands."

He notes the inherent difficulty compared to jugs and explains the need for proper hand positioning, emphasizing hanging low.

He describes the different types of climbing holds, specifying that the one on his right is narrow and positive, making it easy to grip. Shifting to the middle hold, he notes that it is less positive and wider, requiring more strength, usually found around V3-V4 level. Turning to the hold on his left, he highlights that it is part of their hardest circuit, low profile, wide, and hard to hold at any angle other than maybe a slab. The speech is delivered in a calm and informative tone, against a background of general ambient sounds."

The speaker then transitions to describing a green and pink hold, noting its curl back, sharpness, and narrowness, allowing for only one pad."

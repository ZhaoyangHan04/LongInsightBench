He will demonstrate taping using elastic sports tape and, if necessary, rigid tape for more severe injuries. He explains most thumb sprains occur on the ulnar collateral ligament, particularly when landing on an outstretched thumb, often called “skier’s thumb.” He describes the injury and how it can lead to instability and the need for ongoing thumb taping. The speaker will demonstrate two taping techniques."

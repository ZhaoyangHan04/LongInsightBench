    "audio_caption": "The audio clip begins with a male speaker describing a Stephen Curry three-point attempt after an apparent foul by Austin Rivers. The speaker notes that the call was initially a foul, challenged by Minnesota, and overturned by the crew chief with the reasoning, \"because the ball was not touched.\" This is followed by a questioning \"What?\" from a different, possibly male, voice. The first speaker returns to explain that the Minnesota challenge was successful because the ball was not touched, and mentions two prior instances of review system failure for Steph, including another reversed foul and a lack of a call for Austin Rivers running over Steph. The clip is accompanied by a low-volume, unobtrusive background music, which may be instrumental, and sounds that suggest it comes from a TV broadcast."

He then explains that once a child cuts a whole into parts, the whole no longer exists for them at that moment because they haven’t constructed the concept of the whole as a sum of its parts. He further illustrates by explaining that when they divide animals into cats and dogs, they can only think of two parts, and the idea of the whole is forgotten. Thinking about all animals requires dividing the whole and then putting it back together. This mental process is something most five-year-old children can't do."

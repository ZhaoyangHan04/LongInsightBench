The clip concludes with a request to open one's eyes."

He speaks in a clear, explanatory tone, outlining the Monty Hall problem and discussing the common misunderstanding of the probabilities involved. He then provides further examples where common sense misleads understanding, such as the birthday problem and the behavior of non-Newtonian fluids. He also discusses a mathematical proof defying common sense, that 0.9 repeating is equal to 1. He then highlights other counterintuitive scientific facts, arguing against reliance on intuition in science and math."

He starts by asserting that \"scientists don't rely on common sense\", suggesting it can be detrimental in problem-solving, quoting Einstein that \"common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age 18\". The speaker emphasizes discarding common sense in favor of \"empirical evidence and rational deduction\"."

He notes that many struggles when presented with the idea of relatedness between bacteria and humans, and accepting the age of the Earth. The speaker emphasizes the ease of accepting literal biblical accounts due to their common sense perspective, and the usefulness of some pre-scientific conclusions, such as the avoidance of pork, shrimp, and oysters in a time without refrigeration. The speaker maintains a conversational tone throughout."

He transitions into a discussion about why non-scientists may distrust the modern theory of evolution, attributing it to valuing common sense over empirical evidence and logical deduction, which leads to cognitive dissonance, denialism, and anti-science feelings among the general public.

The speaker maintains a conversational tone, explaining how to identify a deepfake, often by looking for uncanny features, problematic jewelry, or complex backgrounds. He suggests that deepfakes are easier to identify than photoshopped images, which require zooming in to examine edges and color mismatches, implying that creating photoshopped images are more difficult than creating a deepfake."

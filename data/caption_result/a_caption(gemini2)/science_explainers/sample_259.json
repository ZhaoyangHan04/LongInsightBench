He mentions the sun rising in the east and setting in the west, then pivots to visualizing this on Google Earth. The speaker describes the Earth's illuminated and dark sides, noting that the US is in nighttime while Europe and Asia are in daytime. He then directs attention to the US Eastern Coast, explaining how its exposure to sunlight first causes the apparent motion of sunrise. He ends by explaining that the western part of the United States gets the last bits of sunlight as the Eastern Coast enters nighttime, creating the sunset illusion. The speaker moves on to describe what this sun movement looks like throughout the day."

Abruptly, the narrative is interrupted by a loud, explosive sound effect, followed by the alien asking \"what was that?\" in a surprised tone. The alien then returns to a more explanatory tone, saying most don't understand space and explains that it is not what they think it is, more like \"a big ball of wibbly wobbly spacey wacey stuff,\" transitioning smoothly back to explaining the premise of the series. In the background, there is dramatic music playing with synth sounds that shifts from intense to calm as the speaker changes tone."

He explains that geometry concerns distances and angles, while topology focuses on the relationships between zones. He provides an example of deforming a square, illustrating how geometry changes while topology remains constant. The speaker maintains an informative and educational tone throughout."

The speaking tone is informative and educational. Subsequently, another male speaker suggests the universe might be finite with an edge. The initial speaker interjects with a correction, clarifying the difference between a finite universe and one with an edge. This is followed by a guttural sound, similar to that of an animal. Then, the first speaker continues, rejecting the notion that curved space implies the universe curves through an embedding hyperspace, highlighting that it only alters the laws of geometry. A short, upbeat chiptune-style music clip plays. Finally, the first speaker concludes by clarifying that the universe expands without expanding into anything."

A cartoonish liquid pouring sound briefly plays, then the second speaker returns, again in a somewhat annoyed tone, asserting \"that's just stupid.\" He then asks what finite universe means, proceeding to explain that it means the universe has finite volume, and that a finite amount of acid could inundate the whole universe. The clip concludes with a gurgling sound effect."

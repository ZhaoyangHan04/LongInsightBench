This music fades as a male speaker begins, his tone serious and concerned, discussing the melting of glaciers. He highlights that the melting is primarily happening on the western side of Antarctica, contrasting it with record-breaking cold temperatures in the east, and poses a question about the cause. The speaker continues in the same tone, stating that the answer is quite simple."

He mentions research by German scientists and the British Antarctic Survey mapping the geothermal heat flow beneath the Thwaites Glacier, noting their discovery of an area where a lot of heat comes from the earth. This is due to the glacier sitting in a tectonic trench where the earth's crust is thinner, according to the speaker."

He states that there are many volcanoes under the ice and that they are more active than scientists initially believed. A team of researchers discovered that an active volcano buried beneath the ice is a factor in the melting of the Pine Island Glacier in Antarctica. Evidence of volcanism was indicated by high concentrations of a specific helium isotope."

The speaker asserts that volcanoes are contributing to the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet, rather than global warming. He then asks why there are so many volcanoes under the ice of Antarctica."

His tone is serious and informative. He describes the heat flux and its effect on glaciers. The speaker then questions why the scientific community ignores the connection between these phenomena. Next, he mentions the same phenomenon occurs in Greenland. A dramatic, suspenseful music score plays in the background."

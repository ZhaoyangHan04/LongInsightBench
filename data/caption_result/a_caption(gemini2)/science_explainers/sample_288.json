She explains that lidar pulses can travel through gaps like those between tree branches and leaves, reflecting off of different parts of the canopy. The speaker notes that this ability to travel through and record information from the top of the canopy all the way to the ground makes lidar systems unique and valuable, allowing them to tell us more about what's happening inside the forest, like the shape or leaf density of the trees. She concludes by stating that the listener now knows how a lidar system generally works. The acoustic guitar music continues in the background throughout the speech."

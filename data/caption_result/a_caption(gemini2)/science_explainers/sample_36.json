He humorously notes that this happened while a spaceship was on its way to Pluto. He then states that he is there to explain why the International Astronomical Union's decision is contentious among people with an emotional attachment to Pluto, and within the scientific community as well. A brief humorous male voice states that Pluto was a planet until a committee disagreed, and then he disagrees back. This is followed by a male speaker introducing himself and his show. The audio then transitions to a retro electronic instrumental piece, reminiscent of a video game soundtrack, that continues throughout the clip."

He suggests that searching for \"planets as defined by the IAU\" would exclude \"interesting moons\" and other \"really interesting places.\" He argues that the definition of \"dwarf planet\" doesn't aid scientific inquiry. He continues, noting that a Google Scholar search for \"dwarf planets\" mainly yields papers about \"M dwarf stars,\" indicating that scientists don't commonly use \"dwarf planet\" for study categorization. Simultaneously with the speech, a brief, rhythmic musical interlude of a simple, quirky tune plays, with a synthesizer and some electronic elements giving it a playful, slightly futuristic mood."

He talks about the reason planets like Ceres or Pluto are reclassified, dismissing the notion of a size-related number. The audio concludes with the speaker conveying a sense that this reclassification was specifically aimed at Pluto."

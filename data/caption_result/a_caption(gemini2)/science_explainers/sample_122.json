She says that, \"we all know water and oil don't mix.\" She describes how the water and oil separate, how apple cider vinegar makes the oil cloudier, and how shampoo completely interrupts the oil. She mentions that the demonstration is \"meant to show you that while apple cider vinegar won't remove the oils from your hair like shampoo will.\""

She notes that apple cider vinegar has a \"strong pungent smell,\" so between washes, she uses pH-stabilizing spritzes with a pH of about four to break up the built-up oil on her scalp and move it down the length of her hair. The female speaker continues, saying that the powers of apple cider vinegar don't stop there and that it also benefits hair strands."

Finally, she ends by repeating \"acid tightens, alkali lifts.\" as a rule of thumb. Music begins in the background, sounding like an upbeat and cheerful acoustic song featuring ukulele, as she speaks."

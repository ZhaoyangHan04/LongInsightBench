He then notes public fear surrounding nuclear energy, particularly after the \"catastrophic events in Fukushima of 2011,\" leading to mass displacement and declining interest in nuclear energy in the West. He mentions Germany's decision to phase out nuclear energy completely. The speaker then discusses the stagnation of nuclear energy expansion in the United States. He says the quantity of operating nuclear reactors peaked in 1996."

He contrasts this with the opinions of supporters, who see it as a climate-neutral solution, and critics, who are concerned about radioactive waste disposal. The speaker then introduces a new type of nuclear reactor that might solve this problem. Throughout this explanation, he maintains an informative and somewhat conversational tone."

His tone is informative and educational. He explains how large atomic nuclei are split, releasing energy and heat, which then evaporates water to drive a turbine and generate electricity. He goes on to point out that the concept has its downsides. The speaker describes the structure limiting efficiency and mentions that the materials used are not advantageous, leading into an invitation to explore the disadvantages of the concept."

He describes the solid fuel rods containing isotopes of uranium, and clarifies that isotopes have the same amount of protons and differing numbers of neutrons, with near-identical chemical properties but differing decay times. The speaker continues by stating that different isotopes of uranium have different stability properties and decay times. He clarifies the amount of time it takes uranium to decay and mentions that nuclear power plants accelerate the decay process. He then mentions uranium 236 and states that it decays extremely fast. The speaker summarizes nuclear reaction by stating that its purpose is to add a neutron to shorten the decay time and release energy more rapidly."

The speaker conveys the downside: uranium 238 is unusable and becomes nuclear waste. Like plutonium from fission, they cannot be used for electricity. The tone becomes speculative, questioning \"or is there any possibility to do so?\"."

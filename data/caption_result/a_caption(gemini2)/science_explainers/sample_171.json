A single male speaker then describes the phenomenon of a blood moon, explaining that it's an evocative name for a total lunar eclipse. He states that this occurs when the Earth lines up perfectly between the sun and the moon, causing the moon to be completely covered in the Earth's shadow, and getting no direct sunlight."

He states that Earth's atmosphere refracts blue light, leaving a reddish-orange light on the moon, and each total lunar eclipse has slightly different color due to water vapor and particulate matter. Noises from a computer are audible in the background as he speaks."

Sometimes, autofocus will work on the moon. He shares his personal gear plans, intending to use a lightweight setup with a new lens paired with his camera and a tracker, which he can set to lunar tracking mode. He notes that he may also use a wide angle or telescope. Finally, he encourages practicing with the gear ahead of time, to go in with a plan for what you want to accomplish and then to practice that plan."

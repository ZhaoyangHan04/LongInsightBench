He details how the tank feeds water to the misting tray, atomizing it using ultrasonic sound waves and propelling it with a fan. He explains that these pulses are silent, producing a fine mist, and contrasts this type of humidifier with ones that heat water. He indicates the location of the unit inside and mentions its creation of the ultrasound. He describes this technology as ideal and a very good way of vaporizing gasoline."

The speaker emphasizes the goal is to burn the gasoline in the engine itself. He concludes with the fact that they are only allowing vapor."

He explains that using gasoline would require grounding the wire and warns about touching the surface of the piece when it's on or running it without liquid, as it could cause an ultrasound burn. He describes the technology as amazing, emphasizing its potential to double the miles per gallon on any vehicle. The speaker mentions that many people are experimenting with this technology and it does work. The speaker shares that the model is a V5100NS and costs just over $50, noting that using these for the house adds humidification. He also mentions that the ultrasonic transducer can be purchased separately online."

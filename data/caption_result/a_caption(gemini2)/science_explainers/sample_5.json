He explains how the energy accumulated is discharged resulting in solar flares and compares the situation to Earth's fault lines causing earthquakes, then points out the solar flares' speed and size, emphasizing that some are propelled toward our planet, which is generally protected by its strong magnetic field, resulting in the formation of the auroras. The speaker notes that sometimes the flares turn into super flares, that even the strong magnetic field of the Earth cannot withstand."

He mentions a peak in solar activity, a large solar storm expected to move toward Earth, and numerous YouTube videos about a predicted solar storm in 2025 that may cause widespread outages. He claims that he has found no credible source mentioning the event occurring, and believes it is just a rumor to scare people. He further states that nobody knows the motive behind the rumors or why they leaked out. The speech concludes with a disclaimer, with the speaker stating that they do not know whether the event will happen or not."

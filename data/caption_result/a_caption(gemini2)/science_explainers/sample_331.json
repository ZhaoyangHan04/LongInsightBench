He then mentions how the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus affects African green monkeys. The speaker also talks about if a monkey from Asia is infected with the HIV from the African monkey or vice versa, resulting in a condition paralleling what we see in humans. Lastly, the speaker asks the question of where HIV came from."

His tone is informative and somewhat academic. He mentions the two main groups of HIV, HIV-1 and HIV-2, and their closest relatives, SIV found in chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys respectively. After this, the clip abruptly ends."

He mentions hunters trapping, butchering, and eating chimps, and the practice of hunting primates for \"bush meat.\" He then says that there is a strong suggestion of where to look, African monkeys, and that evidence suggests a region in Western Equatorial Africa where chimpanzees were found with a relative of the ancestral strain of HIV."

He speaks in an informative tone, also mentioning evidence of previous transfers as far back as the 1880s. He transitions to discuss the first clear case of verified infection in a human sample in the 1960s and the initial expansion in the mid to late 1950s, posing the question about what was going on in Africa during that decade. The speaker mentions urbanization as one factor."

He suggests that colonialism and industrialization, rather than African culture, led to the spread of HIV, particularly due to frequent contact with primates. The speaker references zoonotic transfers of HIV from prey to hunter, drug use, urbanization, and potential spread to Haiti, the US, and Europe."

The speaker wonders why there are large differences in infection rates if all populations were simultaneously infected."

He concludes by encouraging listeners to heed the advice for themselves and their loved ones, ending with a simple \"Thanks for watching\"."

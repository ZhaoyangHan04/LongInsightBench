Simultaneously, faint music plays in the background. It sounds electronic with a slightly ominous tone. He discusses resonance as a concept people struggle with and expresses his intention to simplify it."

The speaker then introduces the concept of applying energy to the bag, first with a large impulse and then with random hits, observing the bag's limited movement. A transition occurs, as the speaker mentions applying small amounts of energy with the correct timing, leading to a bigger result at the resonant frequency. The speaker then compares this principle to a swing set."

He then demonstrates by hitting an object repeatedly, explaining the experiment will show how it works \"with the same timing but a higher amount of energy.\" The thwacking sound of impacts against an object fills the soundscape. He notes that even as the arc of the object increases, the timing of the impact remains consistent, and voices concern it might fall. The clip concludes with the speaker explaining that the sounds were \"a basic example of how resonance works\"."

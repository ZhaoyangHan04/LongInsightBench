He advises listeners to avoid brain chips unless there's a compelling reason, then asks the audience to like and share to “hack the algorithm”. The speaker then promotes his online store where one can “get awesome merch,\" such as t-shirts, and he notes that one can get a discount with XMR payment. The clip ends with the speaker offering a closing remark."

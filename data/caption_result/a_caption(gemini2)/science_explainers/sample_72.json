The speaker returns, explaining the significance of a greeting such as \"we come in peace,\" delivered in a formal tone. He then humorously points out the optional nature of that statement. The clip abruptly transitions to the sound of an explosion. A second, different, male speaker then observes that earthlings greet each other. The clip ends with the opening of an unknown sound, potentially from an electronic device."

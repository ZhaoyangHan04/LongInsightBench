The first speaker, now with a reassuring tone, counters with the fact it would be \"a thousand times cheaper,\" followed by the second speaker's skeptical follow-up: \"it's got to be hard to produce.\" The first speaker, matter-of-factly, dismisses this, claiming \"any high school student could do it\" from their own kitchen."

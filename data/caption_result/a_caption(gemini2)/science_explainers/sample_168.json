Next, another male speaker with an academic tone dismisses this theory as a revived, wacky idea, citing its historical context and debunking by plate tectonics. The second speaker includes a reference to the fact that flat earth is still a subject some people believe. Subsequently, there is a brief disruption as a male named Joe starts speaking before being cut off, accompanied by labored breathing in the background."

    "audio_caption": "The clip starts with a male speaker discussing a creationist named Joe and a living geologist named James Maxlow, followed by his opinion on a video by comic book artist Neil Adams about the expanding earth theory. The speaker adopts a critical tone, highlighting the flaws in Adams' claims regarding the continents fitting together perfectly on a smaller earth. Music plays in the background during the discussion, creating a skeptical and analytical mood. The speaker mentions contacting Adams about the source of the extra mass needed for an expanding earth, quoting Adams' nonsensical response and reinforcing the overall critical tone. Finally, he suggests trying a different explanation."

He then says he asked again about where the extra mass came from, then says that he got this."

He describes a theoretical process involving \"prime matter\" and energy conversion in a hypothetical system. A second male voice interrupts, expressing disagreement and skepticism, suggesting the ideas are not scientific. His tone is critical and dismissive, contrasting sharply with the first speaker's more serious manner. The tone is conversational and accusatory, criticizing the explanation as akin to \"new age hippie speak\"."

The speaker then mocks the concept of \"whatever the sun is made of,\" clarifying it's actually made of hydrogen and helium, adding \"Oh whatever\" with sarcasm. Finally, someone mentions \"this glob of pure energy, whatever, plasma, whatever.\""

He explains that the sun is a concentration of hydrogen fusing into helium and then describes the idea that the Earth's core contains an energy blob converting to matter, questioning the net gain of mass from that. The speaker uses the analogy of an electric car with a generator. His speech then shifts into a casual question. He is then interrupted by a brief, indistinct noise, possibly a rustling or scraping sound, followed by someone speaking in an excited tone, saying, \"draft my ear up again.\" The first speaker replies with a dismissive tone, suggesting they'll return to the topic later."

He references measuring the drift of continents, fossil vegetation, and volcanic rocks. He continues by noting how continents were joined through stratigraphy and paleontology and that uplift is being measured in places of colliding plates. He finishes his explanation with subduction visualization, citing earthquake locations. The speaker concludes that continental drift is perfectly explained by the circulation system of oceanic crust."

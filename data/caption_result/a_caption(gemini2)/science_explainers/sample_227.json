He states that the next episode will dive into how it works, with the intention of understanding \"what it's doing in our tanks\". He wraps up by emphasizing the importance of understanding \"what it is, how it works\", and \"what it's doing\" when adding a chemical to a tank."

He explains the acidic nature of glutaraldehyde solutions, especially when purchased in bulk, and the purpose of the activator solution. The speaker clarifies that glutaraldehyde requires an alkalizing agent to activate and increase the PH, which helps to make it sporicidal. He also mentions that they discard this alkalizing agent and discusses the varying \"day\" versions available for purchase in bulk, elaborating on the period the solution remains activated after adding the agent. The segment concludes with the speaker highlighting the fact that these \"day\" variants do not matter as the activator is discarded."

He clarifies that, although glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde belong to the same chemical class, their chemical and toxicological properties are significantly different, stating that glutaraldehyde does not contain or release formaldehyde and that there is \"absolutely no evidence that it causes cancer\". He goes on to say that products containing less than 50% of the substance are not considered environmentally dangerous and that even in concentrated form, the solution is only about 2.5%. He mentions a chart to illustrate the safety comparison of glutaraldehyde versus formaldehyde, concluding that in very dilute conditions, it's \"relatively safe\". The speaker then proceeds to other considerations before the clip ends. The man speaks in a calm, informative tone."

He notes that this is why you have to dose liquid carbon often in your tank. He follows this by encouraging the listener to still be careful and take precautions when using glutaraldehyde, particularly concentrated solutions. The speaker lists precautions such as use in a well-ventilated area and avoiding contact with skin or clothing. He warns that failure to take these precautions can cause health problems. The speaker concludes by saying it's simple to take these precautions and the listener should just do it."

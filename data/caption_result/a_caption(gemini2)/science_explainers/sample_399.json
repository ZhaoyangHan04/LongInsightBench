His tone is informative and somewhat conversational. He then mentions a historical context with figures like Archimedes and points out a contradiction with \"cutting a circle into an infinite number of infinitely small pieces\". The speaker adopts a slightly more perplexed tone, wondering about adding infinite small sizes, and then asks questions about adding up the infinite small pieces. A short, whimsical musical snippet briefly plays in the background before stopping as the speaker continues."

He then notes the year 1500, when Europe knew less about math than Archimedes did 1700 years earlier, leading to the last year of Archimedes' life, when he defended Syracuse, Sicily from the Roman army, contributing to the war by creating weapons, including the claw. The narrator highlights the order from General Marcellus to capture Archimedes unharmed, but that when the Roman soldier found Archimedes, he was deep in contemplation and refused to step away, supposedly saying, \"Do not disturb my circles.\""

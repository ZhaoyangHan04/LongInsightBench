After a pause, a man with a slightly higher-pitched voice begins to speak about the water, consulting a Wikipedia page for information. He reads from the page, defining the water as coming from a well in Saudi Arabia that has significance in Islamic narratives. He describes the water's origin story and its importance for millions of pilgrims. He expresses his surprise at learning about holy water in Islam. Then a male speaker describes how Dr. Emoto experimented with Zamzam water, finding it difficult to crystallize, even when diluted. After the man diluted one drop of Zamzam with one thousand drops of distilled water he created a uniquely shaped crystal. The narrator mentions that a scientist stated that the formation of the two crystals was because the word Zamzam is composed of two words, \"Zam\" and \"Zam\", ending the clip with a casual \"Allah knows best\"."

He summarizes the story of Hajar, who was left in the desert by Prophet Ibrahim and desperately sought water for her infant son, leading to the divine origin of the Zamzam well. He mentions the Kaaba's relation to the well and how Muslims around the globe face the Kaaba in prayer, ending with the Zamzam well being located about 20 meters east of the Kaaba. Following this, a subtle musical element is introduced, giving way to another male speaker in a jovial tone who concludes the video."

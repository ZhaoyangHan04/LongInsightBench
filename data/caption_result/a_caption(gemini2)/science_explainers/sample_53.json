In addition, the speaker discusses passing unmodified images through a segmentation network and using a label map to specialize the discriminator on individual object classes. The speaker concludes by mentioning that object classes are consistent for rendered and real images and directs listeners to a paper for more details."

He describes the common choice of using a large portion of an image, but notes that this approach proved to be suboptimal.

He goes on to say that their solution is to decrease the field of view for the network, and showing corresponding scenes from both data sets. Then he states that, in this case, the process is automatic and requires no access to semantic label maps. He concludes with, \"More details can be found in our paper\"."

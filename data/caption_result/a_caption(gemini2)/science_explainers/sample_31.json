He elaborates on its varying brightness, introducing the \"cigar hypothesis\" and noting its unusual tumbling motion. He adds that this object has a 10-to-1 length-to-width ratio, which is atypical in our solar system. The speaker suggests the object is made of sturdy material to maintain its unique shape and that it brushed close to Earth. He mentions that it entered the habitable zone of our sun. Finally, he suggests that the weirdest bit of all is that... the clip ends abruptly."

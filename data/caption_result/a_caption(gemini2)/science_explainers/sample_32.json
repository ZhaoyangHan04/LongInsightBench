His tone becomes slightly critical as he voices concerns about tap water, especially in London, referring to it as \"recycled poo water,\" which is filtered but still carries a memory of its origins. He then contrasts this with bottled water, acknowledging its plastic content, leaving him in a \"rock and hard place\". He digresses, introducing music in the background. The music is upbeat and somewhat generic."

He explains he will check the pH level of water, saying, \"The higher the pH, the more alkaline the water.\" He further explains that alkaline water is better for people because it makes it less likely for cancer to attack the body. He says a reddish color means the water is acidic, and not good, blue or purple is good, and green is in the middle. The clip ends with the speaker saying, \"Let's get started now.\" There are no background sounds or music present."

The speaker describes that it is alkaline and an eight, which is good, before transitioning to Evian and commenting, \"Is it gonna make us live young? Let's check the PH.\" It is also alkaline, and the speaker proclaims that the winner so far is Nestle's Pure Life.

He asks \"Come on Buxton, don't let me down\" and then stating \"Okay, yeah nice! It's as good as Scottish Islands.\" The speaker finishes by transitioning to Subway water, stating that he is not expecting high things from these guys, followed by \"Okay, that's good as well, Alkaline, KFC water,\" before commenting, \"Yeah, not as good, that's quite similar to Evian.\""

The speaker explains that \"this spring is made from nitinol wire,\" naming the elements the wire is made from and where it was discovered, as well as the \"shape memory effect\" that nitinol exhibits. They describe the process through which nitinol is formed into a spring at very high temperatures and cooled. Then, they talk about the movement of atoms and how they cause the nitinol to remember its shape. The speaker uses an academic tone to explain how metals comprise small grains and atoms arranged in repeating patterns. They discuss what happens when the nitinol is stretched. The overall tone is professional and academic."

After he makes the contact, the speaker explains that he then gives the top wheel a push and the engine begins to run on its own. The speaker clarifies that it uses the temperature difference between the water and the air to power itself. There is a whirring sound accompanying the engine.

He compares nitinol wire to copper wire, demonstrating the elastic deformation of both. He bends the copper wire too far, leading to plastic deformation, and explains that nitinol, even after extreme deformation, returns to its original state, oscillating briefly. Bending nitinol into loops and then releasing it causes it to straighten out. There is no music or notable background noise in the clip."

He clarifies the concept with a common example: energy plants grow trees or crops, pulling CO2 from the air. After the plants have grown, carbon is left behind while biomass is extracted for biofuel production to power cars or planes. The carbon left behind can be stored underground or mixed into products like concrete. The speaker concludes by stating, \"fuel was produced while removing CO2 from the air.\" The tone is informative and explanatory throughout the entire clip."

Although the technology is expensive, the speaker mentions that it could increase both energy generation and CO2 removal, and that it shows promise. The speaker then segues into another topic: \"direct air capture.\" He then adds, speaking conversationally, that this is likely what most people think of when discussing CO2 removal."

This is followed by a male voice, clearly addressing \"Flat Earthers\", introducing himself as \"Zach.\" Another male voice, identifying himself as \"Steve,\" joins in. They refer back to a previous video, explaining that the \"refraction in the atmosphere...was the solution.\" They then encourage listeners to watch the previous video, with Zach's tone sounding calm and informative."

He goes on to explain that, in the model, it makes the apparent sun go down rather than the observer. He then shifts responsibility, suggesting that any errors are due to the software itself, Cinema 4D, and directs any disagreements toward the software developers, delivered in a similarly matter-of-fact tone."

A male speaker asks what makes the sun go down, mentioning a few theories that might be wrong, before starting to explain one such theory about the atmosphere plane.

He describes the location and dates used, suggesting the listener try it out themselves. He claims that when angles are drawn accurately, \"the sun travels faster the more it moves away from the observer,\" and explains that the distance between 5 and 6 pm is longer than that of 4 and 5 pm. He then adds that the distance between 12 and 1 pm is close to the speed of the sun on the Tropic of Cancer, the speed of the spinning earth in that location.\nHe then makes a clarification: that \"the apparent sun doesn't travel in a straight line like the real sun does,\" so \"the distance between each hour should not be so exaggerated.\" He then questions if perspective is the reason why the sun sets on the flat earth, \"the more the sun moves away from us the slower it should appear to us, right?\" He uses the analogy of a car speeding away on the highway, which appears to slow down as it moves away."

The speaker presents a top view of stars on a flat Earth with an Atmos plane, aiming to demonstrate that the sun and stars rise and set, regardless of the viewer's position. Adjustments to the map and object heights can address any visual discrepancies with real life. He adds the unknown heights of everything and how the real map looks like. He says the Atmos plane makes things in the sky rise and set in Cinema 4D. He says, “If you think that the atmosphere should make things go up instead of down, then please talk to Cinema 4D programmers.” He announces an upcoming discussion in the next video. Throughout this presentation, there's a subtle, mellow background music that creates a calm mood."

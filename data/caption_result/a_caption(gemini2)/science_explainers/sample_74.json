This is followed by a male voice that starts explaining how telephones work by saying they need to \"say a little about sound,\" with a formal and instructional speaking tone. Another instance of ringing is then heard."

    "audio_caption": "The audio clip starts with a male narrator explaining how \"sound waves consist of small and rapid changes in air pressure,\" and mentions that \"the number of changes per second is called the frequency of the sound.\" He describes the need for a diaphragm to reproduce sound, and refers to a boy making one with \"a piece of tissue paper and a comb.\"  Then, a buzzing sound occurs, produced from the comb-and-paper diaphragm. The narrator then describes the use of two diaphragms connected by a string, and explains the transmission of sound between them.  Finally, a high-pitched buzzing sound occurs again."

He then describes the diaphragm, electromagnet, and permanent magnet core. The narrator notes that no battery was needed, but the current was weak and unsuitable for long distances."

He describes modern telephones and changes made over the years, focusing on the \"diagram of a modern microphone\" and its parts: a battery and wires carrying current, which connects to \"the telephone wires\", followed by a circuit filled with \"granules of carbon\". The narrator calls the instrument a \"carbon granule microphone\" and mentions the diaphragm, made of metal."

He describes how the wave pushes the diaphragm in, compresses granules, and alters the current flow. The male voice continues, speaking about how the sound waves are turned into a fluctuating current. He sounds instructional and is the only audible speaker."

He then describes how the current is turned back into sound waves in the receiver, so the speech can be heard. The speaker continues, mentioning a diaphragm attached to an iron bar that is pivoted and mounted close to the poles of an electromagnet, calling the bar a rocking armature, and mentions permanent magnetism in the electromagnet."

He explains that it needs direct current from a battery to work. The speaker notes that one might connect the microphone, battery, and receiver in series, so person A can speak to person B, but that such a system is wasteful. He concludes that the telephone system is connected differently because the battery has to do more work than is necessary."

He describes using transformers to connect telephones, emphasizing their ability to pass fluctuating current while stopping steady current. He continues, explaining how to use a transformer to step up voltage and send messages over greater distances. The speaker then describes how a basic circuit can only speak in one direction, and how it would be possible to use another identical circuit to speak in both directions, but he notes that it is wasteful, and therefore one can rearrange the connections to do so. The speaker concludes that the microphone and receiver are now coupled together through the transformers at each end."

He continues by saying, \"we can now see what happens when a call is made.\""

There's a brief dialogue between two individuals, identified as a male named Eric and a female named Joe. Eric asks how she is, and she responds.\nThe narrator continues, discussing the energy transmitted through telephones. The dialogue concludes with Eric saying goodbye and Joe returning the farewell. The clip continues with the narrator discussing more telephones in a busy place. The narrator emphasizes the direct link is established between the caller and the called, and speaking about the capability of speaking to people around the world."

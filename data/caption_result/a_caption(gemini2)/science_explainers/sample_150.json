This is followed by a brief, distorted repetition of \"Department of Defense first started funding,\" accompanied by what sounds like an electronic effect or alteration on the speech, adding an unusual and somewhat unsettling tone. A male voice then returns in a slightly sarcastic tone, talking about advancements in technology, comparing it to \"point 1% of bacteria still left by surface cleaners,\" emphasizing the need to avoid pressing buttons on devices."

Then the speaker poses a question, \"is this capacity limited?\", followed by an affirmative answer. The speaker asserts that the ability to make new memory cells is limited, but emphasizes the vast number of potential responses and the daily production of lymphocytes. There is no discernible music or background sounds present in the clip."

Every infant has the capacity to respond to 10,000 vaccines at any one time, but the maximum dose in the current schedule is 11, only 0.1% of the immune system's total response capacity.

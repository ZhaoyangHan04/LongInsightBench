The speaker refers to it as the \"pleomorphic theory of disease\", explaining that it attributes disease to the environment and suggests bacteria form from diseased cells. The tone is informative and somewhat critical as the speaker contrasts Béchamp's ideas with Pasteur's. He summarizes Béchamp's suggestions, such as improving the environment rather than quarantining, and acknowledges its not being a stupid idea in the 1870s but notes its being incorrect based on later evidence. Continuing, the speaker mentions Pasteur's theory and how it has been proven useful, referencing genomic data and other scientific methods used in testing. He ends by noting Béchamp's useful insight on the complexity of interactions between disease agents and hosts, while acknowledging modern biology's agreement on the importance of environment, nutrition, and immune status in disease development."

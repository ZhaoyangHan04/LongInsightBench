As the speaker delves deeper into the probe's magnetic field detection, electronic music begins playing in the background. The style and mood seem to be electronic dance music with an uplifting tone. Instruments include synth melodies and driving bass lines. Then, the speaker ponders whether to take something apart for further inspection, culminating in a loud, sharp sound of an object being broken, followed by another instance of the speaker questioning whether anything is worthwhile or not. The focus shifts back to the instrument being incredibly sensitive and can go \"off the charts,\" before the audio concludes with the speaker soliciting opinions from the audience."

He explains that he can set it up and hang it from a piece of string to elicit surprise. A slightly sarcastic tone follows as he anticipates someone saying, \"no way, those are glued together.\" A crashing sound happens. The speaker says “What!” In response. After this the music fades up: electronic, somewhat eerie and ambient, but also kind of bubbly. A rattling sound suggests manipulation of materials is still happening, and the speaker can be heard searching for a piece of wire. There is then another snap and the speaker says \"Broke it\" and announces the end of the experiment."

This music plays as a male speaker expresses his curiosity about listeners' thoughts on a topic, mentioning that while at least one person explains it well, he is interested in hearing other theories. He encourages listeners to share their thoughts on his forums, ending with \"peace and love\" and a mention of a website. The clip concludes with the same electronic music, fading out gradually."

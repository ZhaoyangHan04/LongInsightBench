He expresses further surprise that even adults with jobs attempt to explain it."

The first speaker returns, pointing out the first man is talking about the \"Hovind Theory\". There is then a whimsical musical interlude. The first speaker says \"yeah\" and that \"he seems to have dreamed it up by sitting in a chair\", before mentioning Hovind may not have done the experiment himself. The speaker offers to \"do it for him\". He introduces the experiment to test the Hovind theory, explaining to add different \"flood detritus\" to a jar, including stones, sand, clay, soil, and vegetation, adding water, and stirring. He says to \"leave it to settle\" and that they will look \"more of the Hovind theory\". The whimsical music plays again."

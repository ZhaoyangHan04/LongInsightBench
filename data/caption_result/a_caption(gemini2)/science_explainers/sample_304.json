They describe PsychToGo's vision and introduce the topic of five interesting behaviors that may be linked to psychopathy. They end by again asking the listener to share the video with others. Simultaneously, there is calm background music playing a soft instrumental song to enhance the overall tone."

    "audio_caption": "The audio clip starts with a female narrator introducing the common perceptions around psychopaths and their behavior, often influenced by media like \"Silence of the Lambs,\" \"The Dark Knight,\" and \"Psycho.\" The narrator suggests that when people imagine a psychopath, they might picture an \"archetypical villain\" depicted in films, possibly \"a nonchalant man with expensive taste\" and \"a taste for gratuitous violence.\" The narration transitions to discussing how some behaviors shown in films are inaccurate but others are supported by research. The narrator questions the origins of these associations and whether they hold any truth. The narration is layered over gentle, classical background music that maintains a steady pace throughout."

She starts with the example of \"music taste\", describing the archetype of psychopaths in film being obsessed with classical music, then shifting to a study suggesting a preference for hip-hop artists. This is followed by her downplaying the significance of music taste alone as a determinant of psychopathy. The speaker transitions to the next point, \"sleep chronotype\"."

She then discusses how this preference could indicate \"psychopathy\" or antisocial personality disorders based on a study by Dr. Peter Jonason, who assessed morning and evening people for \"dark triad\" traits. The speaker maintains a neutral and informative tone throughout this portion. She continues to detail Jonason's findings, stating that night owls showed greater antisocial tendencies, suggesting an evolutionary basis. Finally, the speaker concludes by implying that someone's sleep chronotype could offer insight into whether they are \"psychopathic or not.\" A brief yawn sound effect follows after she says the number \"three.\""

A female speaker begins discussing the contagious nature of yawning and linking it to empathy. She references psychological research, and explains how it relates to psychopaths lacking empathy. The speaker references a study at Baylor University that tests this theory. Her tone is informative and analytical. The music briefly fades slightly and stops as the speaker finishes discussing yawning and empathy. The segment concludes with mentioning the trend of posting selfies."

She mentions the study looked at how narcissistic and self-objectifying these men were and how it relates to how many selfies they posted, especially if they edited them. The speaker states these men who posted more selfies also scored higher on levels of psychopathy, and ends by suggesting that frequent selfie posting could be a sign of higher levels of antisocial traits like narcissism and psychopathy. Following the description of the study, the speaker lowers her tone and adds a single word: \"and lastly, sense of smell.\" Background music, which sounds soft and melodic, plays throughout the entire clip."

She refers to a study where participants had to \"identify and discriminate scents\" using \"sniffin' sticks\". The speaker continues to describe research findings, explaining the correlation between impaired smell and abnormalities in the orbitofrontal cortex, an area of the brain implicated in psychopathy. Throughout the speech, background music creates a sense of mystery or intrigue. The woman concludes that a bad sense of smell \"may be a bad sense of smell\" in psychopaths."

The music resumes, maintaining its calm and reflective mood after the voice finishes speaking."

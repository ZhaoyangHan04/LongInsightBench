She details an experiment involving male subjects crossing different bridges, and a female experimenter who asked questions and gave out her phone number.

The speaker then states that many believe this is due to language processing, finishing off with, \"It seems it's just the right side to talk to, right? Am I right?\" and a concluding word: \"nervousness\". A soft, acoustic, upbeat tune plays in the background throughout the whole clip, with the main instruments being guitar and percussion."

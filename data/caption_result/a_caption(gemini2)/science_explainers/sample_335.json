He contrasts this observation with the expectation that calcium supplements should reduce fractures. The speaker seems to convey a tone of scientific curiosity and skepticism."

He explains that modern medicine relies on clinical guidelines, which in turn depend on evidence from large-scale trials, usually funded by pharmaceutical companies. Because of this lack of data, vitamin K2 is not generally recommended, despite the potential. He adds that it is unlikely such a study will be done because it is very expensive. He notes that pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to be interested."

He explains the roles of mTOR and AMPK in sensing nutrients and influencing the cell's decision on whether to be anabolic or catabolic. The speaker ends by asking whether there is enough energy to grow or if the body should be conservative."

He expresses his points in an analytical, somewhat assertive tone, emphasizing that even without protein, carbohydrate consumption hinders autophagy. He then moves on to discuss amino acids and protein, suggesting that their presence decreases the body's need to activate autophagy. He argues that protein restriction isn't an effective way to increase autophagy or lifespan. Finally, the speaker includes the word, \"Boom\"."

The same speaker continues by explaining how the glucose-ketone index reflects the insulin-glucagon ratio and how it is related to higher ketosis and more AMPK."

Another male voice responds with an explanation, stating it depends on the nutrient status of the body and presence of nutrients like glucose, ketones and amino acids. He adds that avoiding carbs and protein daily can speed up the process, contrasting it with consuming more calories. Then a shorter phrase comes from a different voice. The previous male speaker returns stating the more carbs or protein you eat, the longer it takes to get into autophagy, and that mild caloric restriction can keep the body in a state for faster autophagy. He finishes by noting excessive fasting can have negative side effects."

The speaker says “...fasting and eating zero calories is the surest, the most effective way of activating autophagy…”. The speaker’s tone is calm and informative, offering advice and facts about the topic. The speaker continues to provide more specific instructions, “going for a longer fast, then refeeding properly with adequate nutrients”. The speaker’s advice transitions to information on exercise, with a slight change in tone to enthusiastic and encouraging. The speaker’s advice concludes, then transitions into a short clip of a sound that could be classified as a sound effect, similar to a horn."

Then, the clip ends with an electronic sound effect."

He then presents a second idea: diluting a substance, making it weaker, can increase its effectiveness. He describes the process of mixing tiny amounts of a substance into huge amounts of water, shaking it, and diluting the mixture repeatedly until no original substance remains. He states this plain water is then dripped into vials or onto sugar cubes and sold to parents believing it will relieve their children's fever or other problems. Throughout this explanation, the speaker uses a clear, informative tone."

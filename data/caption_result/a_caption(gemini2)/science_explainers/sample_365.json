The first speaker highlights that the last full eclipse was in 2017 and mentions cities that the eclipse is going through, including the town of \"Nineveh.\" The second speaker suggests this is a coincidence, noting many towns are named Nineveh, but the first speaker then counters by stating there are only seven towns named Nineveh in America, and all of them are in the general vicinity of the eclipse, with two directly in line. They then quote Matthew 12:39 and discuss the sign of the prophet Jonah. The speaker concludes this point and indicates the possibility of dismissing it. Suddenly, there is a boing noise, indicating the ending of the clip."

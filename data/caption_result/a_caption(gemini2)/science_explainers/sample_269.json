He reiterates the point of its unique design before being humorously interrupted by another male speaker making a brief, sarcastic comment, \"Europeans are just smarter.\" The first speaker immediately reacts and a short music piece, in an energetic, electronic style, starts playing as the segment closes. The speaker shifts to discussing traditionally competing requirements."

He emphasizes its immersive qualities and balance between detail and playability, mentions his affinity for aircraft in the game, and urges listeners to play it, directing them to a bonus pack link. The speaker's tone is enthusiastic and promotional. Subsequently, another male speaker interjects, asking for his private account. The first male speaker replies, urging them to play and mentioning the free-to-play aspect."

The speaker seems to invite listeners to \"watch those videos where a younger and leaner me\" can be seen, telling a fascinating story. The speaker mentions 'fly-by-wire' and 'digital flight controls.' The speaker describes excellent transonic and supersonic behavior, and summarizes by noting that there is \"no aerodynamic configuration more efficient than Delta Canard.\""

In response to the question, a different male speaker then states the reason this configuration is not more popular is that \"nobody is as smart as the European.\""

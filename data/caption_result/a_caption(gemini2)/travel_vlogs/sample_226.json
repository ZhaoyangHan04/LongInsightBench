He mentions the fact that \"all of that is still less than the price of our monthly rent payment.\" The woman expresses that this is \"good news, guys\". The man follows up by saying that it covers \"pretty much everything we need.\" The woman says this is rent \"before we had rent plus these payments\". The man agrees and the woman mentions how they have \"necessities, random necessities\". The man mentions once he pays off the credit card, he plans to get more insurance.

She notes that it is taboo to talk about money, but believes it's a universal concern and tool. She says that they both have jobs that they enjoy and that the money from those jobs goes towards their lifestyle. A male speaker chimes in, agreeing that money is just a tool and that it’s nice to collect more as it can provide them with safety. He adds that it’s good to set aside money in case something happens and they have insurances in case they need to supplement it. The female speaker says that they have a couple of things that they need to take care of because she doesn’t feel like they’re saving anything at this point. She notes that they'll be paying for more gas and staying at RV parks that are coming. The male speaker agrees, noting that they'll also be working on the road and hopefully making more. The female speaker says that she is always working on expanding her business, which the male speaker agrees with, adding that they will only work within the parameters they want to work with. They conclude that they still want to enjoy everything they're doing. They both agree and the male speaker says that there are also a few other expenses like the things that they need to buy for the trailer and tickets to Disney World. He clarifies that they did go to Disney World the last year and will now be able to go on their own, plus two dogs. The female speaker jokes about sneaking the dogs into the park by putting Mickey ears and a t-shirt on them and telling the staff that they're kids."

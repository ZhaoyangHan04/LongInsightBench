She is talking about her purchase decisions and what she was looking for in a vehicle, like something suitable for hiking in National Parks and off-road travel. She talks about not wanting a smaller vehicle and how she needed something that meets all her needs. She states she learned there needed to be a \"custom plate installed on my truck.\" She mentions that when she hits the brake lights on the motor home, the brake lights actually light up in her truck. She then talks about the Patriot made by Blue Ox and why she did not choose it. She explains that the box would sit right in front of the front seat and you would need power seats to push it in and wedge it in. She says she ruled it out because it seemed like \"just a pain,\" and it was heavy."

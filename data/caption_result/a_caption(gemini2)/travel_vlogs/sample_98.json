A male speaker starts talking about showing a \"little bit of real behind the scenes van life\", mentioning how he usually cleans up the van before recording to make it look better on camera. He emphasizes that editing requires him to deal with looking at himself and his speech, which can be frustrating, and that disarray in the van adds to the distraction. Consequently, he usually cleans up before recording."

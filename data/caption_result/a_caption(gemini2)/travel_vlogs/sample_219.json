He finishes by saying that they are \"outside\" so they should \"have some fun\". The audio then transitions to a rock and roll song with a driving rhythm, featuring electric guitars and a general energetic mood. A male voice speaks a line about a \"nice beard\" and another male voice responds with \"thanks, it's my face jacket\", before the music returns."

As he speaks, water splashes lightly. A male voice then says, \"getting nice and deep with the spoon\", and emphasizes that gold is super heavy, so it is at the bottom of the cracks. Water continues splashing and he mentions he should've brought a smaller pan and mentions the first sign would be black sand. He then exclaims \"Bad example, moving on!\". The splashing stops and he explains that he didn't bring his scratcher tool for crevice, but he did bring a spoon and a metal bar. He continues by stating, \"this is a perfect example why I like coming back to this spot\" and proclaims they haven't even started and have already found their first piece of surface gold. The audio ends with a brief instrumental musical interlude consisting of twangy, western-style music, creating a light-hearted and adventurous atmosphere."

He makes a wet, splashing noise. He excitedly notes all of this is \"crevice material.\" He splashes water. He apologizes. He says that \"if you want to be a good minor, unlike me, bring more than just a spoon.\" He wonders how much moving a piece of \"bedrock made\" of a difference. He concludes that it was \"probably none, but probably some.\" The audio transitions into upbeat reggae music with vocals. Interspersed with the music is the sound of splashing water. The male speaker returns to say, \"And we waste our time, that depends who you ask.\" He assesses the amount of gold recovered, calling it \"a little worse, but it's still gold.\" He then suggests trying more, and makes a whooping sound. Finally, the audio ends with the male speaker describing \"that little crevice I just cleaned out.\""

The speaker notes that there is not much gold, suggesting \"micro poop,\" and indicating that since he worked it with just a spoon he believes there is still gold left. He then ends the clip by saying it's a free gift for anyone that knows the area, and unfortunately that is all the time he has for today."

As the segment shifts towards an outro, he encourages viewers to subscribe and check out his social media and merchandise store. Upbeat electronic music then kicks in, lending a hopeful, promotional mood to the end. The speaker thanks his audience as the music continues, concluding with \"Black screen with logo,\" followed by the line \"That's a place to define gold.\""

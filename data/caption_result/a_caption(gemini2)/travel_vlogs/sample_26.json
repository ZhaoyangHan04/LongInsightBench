Her tone is conversational and informative. She then poses a hypothetical question about traveling with a prosthetic leg, wondering if security would ask her to remove it. She answers with a no, elaborating that the device is considered part of the person, like someone in a wheelchair shouldn't be asked to stand up. The speaker adds that additional precautions are taken, stating she's been fully searched every time, except once, including being \"feeling you up kind of searched\". She emphasizes this could be unsettling, especially for someone with trauma, as it involves touching private areas in front of others, calling it \"weird\" and \"uncomfortable\"."

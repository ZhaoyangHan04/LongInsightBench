There's a distinct slurping sound. He reminds viewers to watch the video until the end as the gold he collects will certainly add up. The sound of running water is prominent, followed by a male speaker explaining that he's noticing his GoPro may have been accidentally switched from 4K to 1080p resolution, making the gold pieces harder to see, but that at least they add up. Next, there is upbeat music, reminiscent of a promotional video soundtrack. A male voice notes that over 70% of viewers aren't subscribed to Pioneer Polly, so he encourages viewers to subscribe and turn on notifications to catch future uploads. The music fades out as the same male speaker observes that it's warm outside, jokingly adding that Botox is free."

Heavy, rhythmic sounds begin, sounding like large rocks being moved, creating a sense of effort and labor. The narrator notes that one of the more taxing parts of gold sniping is moving the gravel. He then points out a tiny crack that was hiding gold but was five feet underwater, making it difficult to stay down. He then sounds excited and says \"I don't know if you can see that\". Then he goes on to talk about how \"a piece of gold is stuck in that little crevice\". The sounds of water and movement continue as he narrates that gold is very visible underwater, especially due to refraction, making it effective to mine. There is a moment of potential concern. He notes that he doesn't know if something was dropped or if it fell into a bottle, noting that he didn't see where it went."

A brief interlude with the music returns before he comments that the piece was very flat, likely causing it to blow away with gravel. Finally, he expresses exhaustion from the cold, signaling the end of the segment. Throughout, sounds of water can be heard intermittently, underscoring the underwater setting of the gold excavation."

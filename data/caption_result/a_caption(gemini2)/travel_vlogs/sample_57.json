One woman recalls a confrontation with an airline representative.  Following their story, upbeat pop music with a slight alternative edge begins to play in the background, and the women sing and laugh along, seemingly mimicking how they feel when listening to 21 Pilots. One asks for embarrassing screenshots to be found and shared on social media. Their tone transitions to a more reflective one as they describe how tired they look, and discuss how \"this is really just a new level of look.\" A brief moment of silence transitions back to the initial storytelling tone where one of them finishes the story about missing the flight, expressing frustration with the airline's lack of assistance."

The speaker emphasizes the amazing craftsmanship of the carpentry, noting that it's the nicest woodworking he's ever seen on a boat. The tone shifts to one of disbelief, almost as though he is discovering these amazing components for the first time. He then mentions a walk-in wardrobe he is about to enter, then notes that, because some of the shots have been dark because of nooks and crannies, he will illuminate a feature. The sounds of the clip culminate with a spotlight turning on."

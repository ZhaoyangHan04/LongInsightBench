He notes that these bags offer enhanced safety features, describing them as a hybrid of a rucksack and Pelican case, emphasizing that their added protection comes at the cost of practicality due to increased weight. He acknowledges their versatility, allowing one to carry all the necessary equipment and quickly access it, noting that his Red Komodo setup can be fully rigged inside of the bag, which contrasts with the camera rucksack, where some equipment would need to be left at home. He concludes by stating that these are two entirely different tools that inherently do the same thing, transitioning into which bag to buy."

He notes the contrast ratio and creative use in high-key, low-key, or silhouette choices and the use of devices like flags, rags, nets, or diffusion. The speaker concludes by saying that, \"It just makes the whole concept of contrast ratio and dynamic range a little bit more robust and interesting.\""

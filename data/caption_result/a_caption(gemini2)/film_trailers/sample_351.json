A somber, slow string piece follows with a melancholic tone, then the sound of someone sighing. A male voice, sounding weary and somewhat resigned, thanks someone. The clip concludes with the sound of a cigarette being offered and accepted, as the weary voice says \"Thank you\"."

He begins by suggesting that if the listener had approached the house normally, they would have been invited to lunch. He goes on to say he has anticipated meeting the listener for years. He then admits he doesn't know the listener. He finishes by saying \"like you, my dear Thorndyke\"."

He elaborates on the open, vulnerable landscape before revealing the presence of a man with a rifle, remarking on his uncanny judgment of distance. Then, the tone shifts towards the idea that this man cannot be allowed to live. Another male voice interrupts, questioning whether the first man thinks he's an assassin. The first man clarifies that he never intended to shoot, but was experimenting to find out if it were possible, emphasizing that the excitement of it, the danger, the fun. He says that someone jumping him made the gun go off, and then states that his companion is disappointed."

He questions the other's \"claims as a hunter of big game if you failed to understand the fascination\" of hunting the biggest game on earth. Another male voice responds that \"the most dangerous of all animals\" is man, to which the first male voice responds that the \"sport is in the chase, not the kill\". He specifies he doesn't kill anymore, because the rifle work is \"sheer cruelty and I don't like cruelty.\" He is interested in the instinct of an animal that isn't going to let him near enough to shoot. The second male speaker indicates that the conversation is fascinating, but questions the \"softness\" of the other's nature when it comes to firearms."

There's then a transition to a somber, brass-heavy musical piece, reminiscent of a funeral dirge, with prominent use of what sounds like a tuba.

Another man inquires about the contents of the note, asking if it is a suicide note."

The first voice presses on, questioning why the accused didn't leave his rifle behind if he truly had no intention to shoot, after which the second, more contemplative male voice responds that \"It wouldn't have been sporting\".

A male speaker introduces himself as Kevin, mentioning he is on the \"Sahajarvi trail\" in Teijo National Park, which he explains translates to \"Saw Lake\" in Finnish. He contrasts his current trip with a past visit where he walked across the frozen lake, indicating it is now open water. He says he'll be taking a \"small rope ferry\" to an island, expressing his anticipation for the experience. The audio concludes with the sounds of what seems to be a creaking mechanism, presumably the rope ferry in operation."

Later, an indistinct sound is heard, perhaps speech, ending abruptly.

Instead of continuing on the \"Sahajarvi Trail,\" he decided to go back to the car and head home, as he stepped quite badly last night and doesn't have the energy to do it. He took it easy this morning and decided just to enjoy the scenery. The recording transitions to the sounds of a small ferry, accompanied by the crunching of snow, indicating a cold outdoor environment. The speaker then notes that the ferry is on the way back over again, guessing it's probably one of the last few days when it's actually working anymore. Ending his recording he thanks people for joining him on this first winter camp of 2023, hoping people enjoyed it and saying he'll catch people on the next trail. The speaker signs off as Kevin, wishing all the best, followed by “Moi Moi”. As he speaks, the crunching of snow continues."

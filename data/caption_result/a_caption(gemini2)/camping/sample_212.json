He mentions that he is with someone he identifies as \"Ro to the Bow\" who is apparently tired. The man clarifies the recording is for YouTube. He describes their hiking plan on the Lathem Loop, aiming for three miles to the top of the mountain and discusses the challenge of finding suitable trees for hammocks as the area is more suited for tents, while background sounds of rustling are audible. The man mentions synthetic underquilt and the goal to have fewer people camping due to rain and thunderstorms, and mentions there are only a few cars in the parking lot. A young girl speaks, while the man expresses hope to have enough trees and a beautiful view, despite the overcast weather."

He then continues his description, mentioning it's \"leg day.\" A second male speaker says, \"Look at that.\" This speaker describes the scene they are experiencing. \"It's like smoker fog going inside the cloud,\" and calls it \"like something from a horror movie.\" The speaker notes that there's no fog over there, but as they go to the trail, the speaker says that the fog is there. He concludes that this is a lot of work. The clip ends with him saying, \"All right.\""

Someone is heard asking if people have been down at that location. The man jokes it was just them, but the woman asks if nobody else in the world has been there. The man says if someone did, they left no trace. He is followed by the female exclaiming, \"that's right!\" Then, sounds of heavy breathing and panting accompany their walk. The female speaker remarks that she saw snow and the male speaker, in a mildly playful tone, corrects her, identifying it as clouds. She then is surprised that it's only a cloud. The man mentions a mountain that then disappears again. He also remarks that the clouds are going away."

It transitions into an acoustic instrumental, with a gentle and slightly melancholic tone, with the main instrument being the guitar. Subsequently, we hear sounds of ice or snow crunching, accompanied by male speech. The man notes the ice and open water, before transitioning to offering sledding advice, including guidance on using poles and hip movements for control. The music returns, now sounding hopeful. More crunching noises are heard. Finally, a male voice says \"Come on, you got this,\" ending the clip."

The speaker then continues to mention setting up a tent in the general area because the lack of snow depth makes the area \"really flat\" for placing the stove. It's important to have a flat surface because they will have a box of fire and \"don't want to mess around with it.\" He also speaks about making a flat place for the stove to go, then continuing to make it good over here and have a pile of bows. The speaker sounds like a male, giving instructions in an informative tone. Throughout this audio clip, there is the sound of snow crunching underfoot, suggesting an outdoor, wintry environment."

The first voice states, \"out to dry,\" then, \"I guess this counts as taking my tent out to dry.\" A second voice says, \"Oh hello,\" and begins introducing \"Drew with Michigan Adventure Life\" then is joined by the first speaker, introducing \"John.\" They announce they're \"out here at the Soole Camp Ground on the Pure Marquette River, on the National Forest side, and we're camping and fishing.\" A soft acoustic guitar intro transitions into a mellow country-folk instrumental, adding a peaceful vibe to the background."

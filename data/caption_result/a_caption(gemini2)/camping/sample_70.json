He explains his dog needs water and that finding a water source is nice to have for dogs, but not for humans, as they \"don't know where this water's coming from\", and it might be a \"sewer plant nearby\". The speaker directs his dogs to \"get the water\". He concludes by mentioning he'll make a little trail so he can walk down there with his dogs so they can get water. Throughout the speech, there is constant, moderately loud crunching background noise suggestive of footsteps on a trail, and occasional dog sounds."

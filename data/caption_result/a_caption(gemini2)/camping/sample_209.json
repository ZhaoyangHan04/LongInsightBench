The speaker identifies a water hose to dump the black tanks and explains where the front gray tank is located, plus the location of the black and gray tank in the back. They suggest strategically locating the tanks to reduce how far the hose must run. The speaker concludes with the assertion that it's time to hook it up and says that the first thing to do is to wear gloves, ideally rubber gloves. Sounds of the outdoors and perhaps traffic are noticeable in the background. The clip is underscored by a simple, slightly melancholic piano melody."

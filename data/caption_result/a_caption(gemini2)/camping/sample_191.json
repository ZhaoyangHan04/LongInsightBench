He continues, discussing a gas canister stove, emphasizing its efficiency and ease of use, and mentions that it's often used for quickly boiling water. He acknowledges a downside to these types of stoves, related to the cost of the gas canisters that fuel them, citing a specific brand and model. The speaker gives price and estimated boil counts for a single unit, and mentions financial considerations once the canister is depleted. The audio clip ends with a short breath."

He explains the contents of a Power Gas Primus canister, which includes propane and isobutane, and mentions that he will transfer solid butane. The speaker then references butane canisters used in cooker stoves, and mentions the cost of a pack of four in the UK.

He transitions to explaining a procedure to transfer gas, stating they will need a small brass valve with a one-way valve and an O-ring, promising a link in the description. He notes that this is the cheapest method, costing a couple of quid. Next, he weighs the canister, and shares the results, pointing out it should contain 230 grams. There is a rattling sound, and the speaker notes that there is very little gas left, probably just the weight of the tin itself."

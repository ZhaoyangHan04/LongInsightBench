A male voice begins speaking in a casual tone, stating that with the crew coming in today, they can't spend as much time fishing or sleeping, and that he and Kara need to get up despite her being tired from the day before. He continues, mentioning that a perk of camping like this is having real food, such as milk and cereal for breakfast. He adds that Kara is more than happy to get out of bed once there's some jerky in her morning kibbles."

He mentions a specific bridge and then says that they need to get out to \"hit the water\" and \"get a bit of fishing in.\" Soon, the male speaker introduces the presence of \"Cara's other favorite people\" to show up. As he speaks, quiet, melancholy music plays. He describes a less than ideal fishing spot, the boat ramp, although it is a good place to launch a boat. He also mentions an outhouse. The male voice continues by saying that they killed time, enjoyed the lake, and cast around \"to see if we can hook up with some of those world-class northern pike.\" Then, \"before you know it, the gang's all here,\" and they go out to an island to \"set up\" their \"home sweet home.\" The audio clip concludes with the melancholy music that increases in volume."

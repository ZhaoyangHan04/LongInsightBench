He continues talking, stating he's not sure if light is a particle that propagates like a wave, but he does affirm the effect is real. He describes a little obstruction - a piece of wire - and what happens when it's put in the path of the light. The speaker goes on to describe that when the wire is placed horizontally, the spike is vertical, noting the occurrence as \"weird\"."

He clarifies that stars appear round, adding \"stars are actually round, not spiky.\" The clip concludes with the statement, \"the star is real, the spikes are not.\""

He claims to be like \"I am God\" upon succeeding. He continues by saying that no two eyeballs are the same, which is why what we all see can be considered \"individually delusional.\" He explains that professional astronomers realize this is \"a trade-off.\" Throughout the clip, the speaker is speaking in a casual, educational tone. The sounds of cars passing can be heard in the background, providing an outdoor setting."

Transitioning to the topic of Starlink, the speaker shares that astronomers complain about their ruining exposures, and that we have to complain about artificial obstructions throwing light around all exposures. He ends by pondering if something has been missed because it was hidden right here. The speaker maintains an informative and conversational tone throughout."

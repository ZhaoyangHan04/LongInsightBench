The female speaker then asks the physicist about the duration of her search for alien life, and the physicist replies, \"Probably my own involvement, the last 15 or 20 years.\""

Another female speaker acknowledges this point, noting that the lack of sun's heat doesn't necessarily preclude liquid water, to which the first speaker agrees. The second speaker mentions a \"ball\" nearby, and the first speaker affirms that she will make that clear.

Another woman responds, her speaking tone initially conversational and then becoming more descriptive and nostalgic as she tells the story. She describes saying yes to things she was unsure of, and then recounts childhood memories from South Africa. She mentions her dad building a telescope and grinding the mirror, as well as her and her sister mixing concrete for the base of the telescope, which she says, in a slightly humorous tone, was very important. The first woman agrees, asserting that concrete and foundations are critical. The second woman continues, noting that her first view of Jupiter and its moons was through that telescope, followed by observing Saturn's rings. The first woman is audibly impressed. She asks how old the speaker was at the time. The second woman then recalls being around 12 or 13, at which point the first woman remarks about this being a formative experience. The second woman agrees."

She says she now thinks she vaguely knows what she is doing, but it was something that she wasn't sure of but that was exciting.

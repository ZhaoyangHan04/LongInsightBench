A male speaker asks, “What is the brightest star in Earth's sky?” and asks, “Anyone?” His tone is conversational and inquisitive. Then, an orchestral score begins, sounding grand and somewhat ominous, like music from a science fiction movie. As the music plays, the male speaker continues with the science presentation. The speaker describes \"brightness\" as \"the measurement of the luminous flux from a light source\", explaining astronomical magnitude and how \"the lower the magnitude of a star or object, the brighter it appears in the sky.\""

He provides its location relative to Earth and the constellation Sagittarius, emphasizing the star's extreme brightness and the fact that, without the dust, it would be a fourth magnitude star visible to the naked eye. He adds that it was discovered in 1990 after the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope. The clip concludes with a distinct, short sound effect."

Subsequently, the speaker quotes Don Figer of UCLA, who discussed the discovery that this star might have been more massive than any other. The quote also emphasizes that its formation and life stages will provide important tests for new theories about star birth and evolution."

Now, you're going to talk about stars exploding!\" The clip abruptly cuts to a sound effect of a thunderous explosion, followed by a clip of children's voices, with a male speaker stating, \"He does have the eye of the tiger.\" A male speaker excitedly responds, \"Are you sure about that?\" The scene shifts back to a lecture-style male speaker discussing the discovery of supernovas in 185 AD in China. The speaker describes supernovas as massive explosions at the end of a star's life cycle and mentions their rarity. The clip concludes with a sound effect similar to the previous explosion."

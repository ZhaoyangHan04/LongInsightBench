He explains that our galaxy consists of hundreds of millions of stars, including our sun, and that all stars visible to the naked eye are from the Milky Way. He continues by describing that our sun and other stars rotate around the galactic center, while their relative positions remain mostly the same, although individual stars have some movement. Finally, he states that this movement is difficult to track without very precise equipment."

The speaker clarifies that the tilt stays the same, but the earth's position in its orbit around the sun causes the difference. He adds that the rotational axis still points in the same direction in both summer and winter. The clip ends with the male speaker sighing."

The speaker notes polar alignment is necessary for this to work, which involves looking through a scope and pointing at the polar star, Polaris. He concludes by mentioning seeing something."

He further explains that looking at the sky and seeing certain stars at a position, shows the same position the next day after 23 hours and 56 minutes, and due to that difference, every day has roughly 4 minutes of difference over 365 days, adding up to an additional rotation. He finishes by thanking the listener for watching and saying goodbye."

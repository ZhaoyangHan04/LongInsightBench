He describes developing the controllers, data acquisition system and detector controller in the lab and how they were later modified and used in space. He mentions they worked on the UAIT part of Astrosat, which uses a star 250 imager sensor. He explains the detectors they purchased were not space qualified, so they bought off-the-shelf devices that were space qualified with help from TIF and ISRO.  He details the design and development of the data equation system and high-speed detector controller in the instrumentation lab, having started the project in 2003 and worked on it for two to three years. Afterwards, in the years 2010-2012 work continued in smaller pieces to resolve issues or update old documentation."

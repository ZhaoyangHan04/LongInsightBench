He highlights that fast radio bursts come out at radio wavelengths, last milliseconds, and are one of the biggest mysteries in astrophysics. He further explains the difficulty of detecting these bursts due to interference."

He speaks in a factual tone, describing how interference can often be mistaken for radio signals, relating a story about pulses of radio interference caused by a local farmer starting his car and microwave ovens in the observatory. He then notes that the telescope was befuddled by microwave ovens at the time. Shifting focus, he mentions that years later, researchers examining the data discovered a strange pattern, describing the data displayed. His tone is academic and informative throughout."

The speaker outlines that if space was empty, the pulse would arrive at all frequencies at the same time, but as radio waves go through plasma, lower frequency radio waves slow down. The speaker continues, explaining that as more telescopes discovered the phenomenon, it became clear that it was some sort of extragalactic radio burst, concluding the audio clip."

He then gets into specifics about the time period, stating \"look at this one here\" and \"that's less than half a millisecond.\" The speaker elaborates, giving additional time measurements. He concludes that these are \"incredibly short, much shorter than gamma-ray bursts.\" The speaker infers that \"this time is probably not caused by how long the actual radio burst goes on.\""

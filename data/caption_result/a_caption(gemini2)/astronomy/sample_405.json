He explains that it mathematically expresses the force between two bodies, defining variables like 'F' for force, 'm1' and 'm2' for masses, and 'r' for distance. He adds that there is a gravitational constant. The speaker transitions to a discussion of experimentation to prove the law. A science-related theme continues as the same speaker talks about comparing gravity across other planets in the solar system. He begins with the planet Mercury. There is no music or ambient sounds during the speaker's description."

He goes on to describe how understanding gravity relies on a planet's mass, size, and density. After that, he invites the audience to find more information in the description and expresses gratitude, ending with thanks for support. As the speech concludes, orchestral music with a cosmic, ethereal tone starts up, creating a sense of vastness and wonder."

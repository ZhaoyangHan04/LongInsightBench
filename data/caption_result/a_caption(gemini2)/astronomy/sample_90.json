The music is rhythmic and constant, evoking a sense of tension or intrigue. Suddenly, a female speaker begins to talk about pulsars, defining them as families with subgroups, mentioning magnetars as one of those subgroups. She speaks in a calm and informative tone.  Her monologue ends and the electronic music continues, maintaining its previous mood and characteristics."

The speaker, in a calm and articulate tone, says she's writing a poem around that point. The poem is called \"Delay.\" She then reads the poem in a gentle, expressive tone. As she finishes reading, gentle, peaceful piano music starts playing."

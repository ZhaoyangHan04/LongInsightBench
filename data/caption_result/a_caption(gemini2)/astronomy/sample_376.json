The music fades and is replaced by a female voice introducing the topic as \"Space 2023,\" promising a look forward at astronomy. Next, a male speaker with an enthusiastic tone says \"Welcome back to The Cosmic Companion,\" identifies himself as James Maynard, and describes the episode as wrapping up season six with a look at Space 2023. He jokes that a massive nuclear explosion will rip the moon from orbit, but is quickly corrected by the female speaker. The man clarifies the show will focus on what's happening in the night sky over the next 12 months, and preview upcoming show content. A sound effect similar to a camera shutter concludes the segment."

He says, \"It's a historic moment, because he's actually looking up through the docking window, undertaking the first ever docking in space between two crude spacecraft.\" He quotes Rusty Schweikart as saying \"I can't tell you how hard he's concentrating in that moment\", adding that this was the first time they had ever undertaken the docking. He continues that the controls were set up for landing on the moon, so he was translating through 90 degrees all of those movements. He concludes by saying that they were in a spacecraft that couldn't get them home; it had no heat shield."

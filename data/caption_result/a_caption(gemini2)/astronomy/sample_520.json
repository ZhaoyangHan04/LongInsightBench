This drone-like sound is then accompanied by a woman's voice, speaking in a calm, informative tone. She discusses the possibility that our solar system may be surrounded by objects, mentioning terms like \"alien spaceships\", \"interstellar objects\", and \"cosmic jetsam\". Intermittently, the electronic hum intensifies with a rhythmic pulsating quality. The voice continues to describe cosmic phenomena, adding in the possibility that our solar system \"may once have booted out a whole planet\", after which a brief, unresolved \"what?\" is heard."

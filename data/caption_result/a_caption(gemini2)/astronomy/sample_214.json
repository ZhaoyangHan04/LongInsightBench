He describes changing the measurement table to full width half maximum and discusses the numbers displayed and how they represent focus. He then explains shifting the values to remove certain values and addresses an issue where some nights had high cloud, resulting in low signals, which appeared focused, but actually looked horrible. He then moves on to explaining the use of the stars column and how it allows one to see how many stars PicsInsight was able to count in every frame. He discusses sorting by star count and selecting frames for removal, so that only the best frames remain. Finally, he describes changing the directory for output to move remaining files that weren't deleted to a folder called \"Good Subs.\""

He encourages viewers to subscribe for \"stupid astronomy comedy\". Next, he mentions stacking registered files with drizzle files. He then humorously addresses his CPU by name. There's an excited tone as he describes the final stack image appearing. Following his excitement, a synth-heavy music track begins, creating a feel good vibe. The man comes back in, with a happy exclamation, then describes the picture of the image as sharp. He talks about how the best results come from using the best data and notes he's only using the top 25% of available data, characterizing it as \"lucky imaging\"."

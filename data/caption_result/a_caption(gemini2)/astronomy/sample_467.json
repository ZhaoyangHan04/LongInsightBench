He mentions descriptions of Uranus and Neptune, as well as the solar system with recently discovered planets. The speaker introduces the idea that this knowledge was given by \"Anunnaki,\" who \"interbred with humanity\" creating a hybrid race. He claims this theme appears throughout the world, even in Genesis in the Bible. He states that the biblical \"sons of God\" phrase actually means \"sons of the gods.\" The speaker suggests that society has been \"misled\" and misunderstands the difference between \"the gods\" as extraterrestrials and God as consciousness. He concludes that Sumerian tablets confirm this ancient race."

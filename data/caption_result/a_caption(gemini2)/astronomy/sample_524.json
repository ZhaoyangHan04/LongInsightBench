The speaker mentions natural disasters and people's beliefs, stating that Nibiru may be very far away, potentially orbiting another sun, taking a long time to be visible. The speaker adopts a more emphatic tone, exclaiming \"Does that not just blow your mind apart?\". He suggests there are six credible pieces of evidence to prove Nibiru's existence, emphasizing that something might be out there that will confirm \"our wildest suspicion\". The tone then shifts to intrigue, ending with \"Just wait until you hear this\" followed by a single low pitched, drawn-out sound effect that sounds like a low rumble."

He is speaking in an excited tone and plans to put his telescope back on and show viewers how to collimate. He explains the importance of collimating before a planetary session, emphasizing that high focal lengths magnify any aberrations with the mirrors, which will result in poor focus. The speaker apologizes as his bird starts going crazy, creating a background noise."

A male voice then notes that the video segment applies to backyard observatories, explaining the need for moisture absorbers due to humidity. The speaker says, \"I'm using this damp rid stuff\", adding that rain has made things wet and that condensation can damage electronics.

He admits it was a foolish act but states he did it for the benefit of the listener and claims everything he does is for their sake. This transitions into a brief, earnest-sounding musical interlude featuring a male vocalist singing, possibly accompanied by an acoustic guitar or similar instrument, before concluding with the speaker saying \"Fingers crossed\"."

He then instructs to identify and adjust the screw on the thin side of an airy disc, noting the star's movement on screen during adjustment. This leads into another tip: if arrows going up left and right do the opposite of expectations on screen, the controller can be flipped to make them more intuitive. The speaker then describes adjusting a bob's knob and trying to chase the star around the middle and then he makes adjustments to the screw on the thin end.  The speaker continues to describe an observation of the screen and what is being pursued as well as making the necessary adjustments for that."

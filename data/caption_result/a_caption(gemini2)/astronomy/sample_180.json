He expresses that answering fundamental questions about dark matter drives a strong desire to learn more. He describes it as curiosity-driven, nearly obsessive, and wonders how many more years it will take to discover dark matter. At the end of his speech, there is another word that is not easily understood."

The speaker notes that it's unclear if self-interacting dark matter is necessary, given the uncertainty surrounding star formation and their interaction with galaxies, suggesting that there might be enough flexibility to align simulations and observations. However, the speaker mentions that as understanding of the visible sector improves, the demand for more complex dark matter models increases. He expresses a preference for a self-interacting dark matter model for its potential to offer a more interesting and complex \"behavior ecology\" that is currently unobservable. He attributes this inability to the challenge of seeing dark matter."

He identifies that the project is called Saber and that it will sit and wait for the collision of a ghost-like particle that will cause the crystal inside to glow.

A male speaker begins to present a narrative about astronomy, speaking in a measured and informative tone, stating that \"astronomy is considered to be the mother of the scientific method\" with roots in ancient cultures, like Babylonia, and the influence of Greek natural philosophers and also highlights contributions by Indian astronomy. The background music maintains a low presence beneath the narration."

He discusses the concept of proper motion, referencing Suryasiddhanta and Arcturus, pointing to a possible ancient measurement and citing a difference of six degrees, attributed to proper motion and planetary precession.  Transitioning the analysis of these concepts is mentioned by Anil Narayan, a former ISRO scientist. The analysis considers the difference of latitude data to distinguish between planetary precession and proper motion."

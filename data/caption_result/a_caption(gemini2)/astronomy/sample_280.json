A male voice then cuts in, speaking in a thoughtful tone to introduce the idea of life on the moon. The music continues subtly in the background as he discusses potential new insights into the moon's history. As the male speaker concludes with the notion that the moon's story is linked to the story of life itself, the music becomes the primary focus again."

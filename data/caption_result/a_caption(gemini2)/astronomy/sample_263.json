The female speaker expresses how cool this is."

The male speaker comments that it is \"very good,\" followed by a brief giggle, potentially from the child. He then adds \"Alright, nice meeting you.\" As they move, the sound of a vehicle or engine in the background increases. The male speaker mentions they have made it to the tennis courts and Neptune. The child states Neptune is pretty big and continues to talk with \"Same size as Uranus, actually, same size, basically.\" There is speech and then silence before the music fades out completely."

In a hopeful, questioning tone, she asks \"where is Pluto?\". A female speaker speculates they have to walk to find it. She mentions running out of sidewalk at the ballfields, still searching for Pluto. Continuing her journey past more ballfields, she notes Pluto is a long way from Neptune. Further dialogue reveals they are following someone's directions to find Pluto, but they are walking past all the ballfields, with diminishing pedestrian paths. As the speaker continues on her hunt, she states, \"Here's the end of Tacoma,\" as they move past the ballfields. Finally, the female speaker cries out, in a forlorn tone \"Bring back Pluto\" and another speaker is heard saying \"Show me the bottom sheet.\" A musical interlude, employing wind instruments, creates an atmospheric mood. Accompanying this journey, constant background traffic noises create a steady hum throughout the whole clip."

Another male speaker chimes in with an \"oh yeah,\" as she points something out. The female speaker then exclaims \"wow\" in awe and mentions Canada and \"Anne Shirley\". The first male speaker concludes with \"That's far.\" and then one or both voices say, \"We did it!\" as they express satisfaction.

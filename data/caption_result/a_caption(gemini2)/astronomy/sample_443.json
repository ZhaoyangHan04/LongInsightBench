He describes Copernicus's belief in perfectly circular orbits and constant speed of planets, using examples like \"Earth with Mars\" and explaining how Mars would \"move in prograde motion.\" He likens the phenomenon to a runner overtaking another on a track, causing the planet to appear to \"backtrack or execute a retrograde loop.\" The speaker also talks about the planet resuming its path around the sun."

He clarifies that retrograde motion doesn't need an epicycle, as it is simply an apparent motion due to Earth overtaking outer or being overtaken by inner planets. The speaker notes the simplified nature of this model compared to epicycles, concluding with a tone suggesting finality or resolution to the point."

The speaker describes how the telescope found stars moving at enormous velocities within galaxy cores, indicating the presence of a \"colossal gravitational field\", thus providing the first solid proof of black holes' existence. The narrative is delivered in a documentary-style tone, accompanied by background music that is cinematic and suspenseful. This music contributes to an atmosphere of mystery and discovery, providing a subtle undercurrent to the scientific explanation."

She continues, mentioning how Hubble made something visible for the first time in 2008, discovering a tiny point of light in the extensive dusty ring surrounding Fomalhaut. She states that Hubble began planet hunting, taking the first direct visible light image of a planet in another star system, and has since become known as an exoplanet explorer. Throughout the clip, there's a light, space-themed music in the background that accompanies the speech."

She states, \"Hubble analyzed for the first time the atmosphere of a super Earth,\" suggesting that in the future, scientists may find hints of life. The tone is informative and scientific. Soft, hopeful orchestral music plays in the background. The music then transitions, continuing to be calm and ambient, while the narrator states that Hubble has revolutionized the overall understanding of planet formation. She shares Hubble's discovery that at least half of the stars are surrounded by rotating gas and dust, which are the raw materials for planet formation. She concludes by explaining Hubble's observations that suggest planets are being formed around many more stars than previously thought, increasing the possibility that life could exist somewhere out there."

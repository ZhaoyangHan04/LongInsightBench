A short burst of music interrupts him, then he exclaims \"wow.\" The speaker then suggests training an AI model with his voice, and GPT4 to mimic his conversational style for phone calls with his mother. He transitions to a \"teatime\" impression. The speaker then addresses his current technology struggles regarding latency, but suggests using a text messaging bot instead, which is his normal way of communicating with his mother because he doesn't want to have to talk with people \"like with my voice.\" Then, as a first step, he explains that he communicates with his mother through Signal."

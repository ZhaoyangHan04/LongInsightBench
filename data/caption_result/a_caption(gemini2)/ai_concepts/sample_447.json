Next, the speaker re-states the problem: \"We need to create an image classifier without having some samples of some object categories,\" giving an example about creating an animal classifier without enough giraffe samples. He then proposes, \"One way we could possibly do this is zero-shot learning,\" indicating learning from zero examples."

He explains how they don't know which features to define, or what to call them, before moving on to propose an alternative solution. He proposes they could draw it instead. Another male speaker adds that this removes naming ambiguity and that a picture describes a thousand words."

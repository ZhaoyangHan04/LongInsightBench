He describes a desire to make it possible for a doctor or radiologist to discuss \"with the AI on the individual level.\" The speaker describes a back and forth where the medical professional can ask questions and voice their own assessments, aiming to build a better working relationship with the AI. The goal is for this interaction to occur in the same framework familiar to the doctor, without requiring computer science expertise. The speaker concludes by summarizing the intent of this approach. The speaker sounds enthusiastic and articulate, with a confident tone."

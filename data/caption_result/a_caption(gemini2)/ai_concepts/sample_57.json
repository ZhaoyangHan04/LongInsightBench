This transitions to one man speaking, recalling a video of Atlas doing \"and then,\" followed by a series of beeping noises. The speaker then describes everyone's reaction as \"Whoa!\" leading into another man speaking calmly about how \"this is nothing,\" and how quickly the bot will be moving in a few years. The first speaker then returns in a sarcastic tone and says that he's \"still waiting for my atomic car and my hoverboard.\""

The audio transitions into a musical interlude with a synthetic, electronic melody that evokes a somewhat serious, reflective mood. Then, another male speaker reflects on his prior use of \"reinforcement learning\" to train a robotic dog how to move, noting that \"reward functions incentivizes behavior you want the robot to do.\" He shares challenges associated with creating \"accurate, stable reward function.\""

The speaker then transitions to discussing his video and his thoughts on the benefits of having access to hints in the form of animal movements for policy, specifically in the context of a quadruped robot. He mentions his discovery of the adversarial motion priors implementation in Isaac Gym environments, noting that only the style component was implemented. This leads him to contemplate that with some tweaking, it would work great."

He moves on to describe taking motion files for humans, since it is a humanoid robot, and going on a journey of exploration. The speaker notes that the codes Nvidia has, are good research codes and very reproducible, especially for experiments with humanoid characters. Continuing, the speaker states that, if you want to use your own robots, there are a lot of rakes to step on. He wants to give an overview of the steps and assures listeners that it is not a production-ready code, but hopes, that if listeners follow his guides, they will only step on two or three rakes, instead of 200, like he did. The speaker then instructs listeners to continue on to the next video for code instructions, and suggesting looking at a playlist about large language models, for people interested in them. This is overlaid with music in a pop or light electronic style."

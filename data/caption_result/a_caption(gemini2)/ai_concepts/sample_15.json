The male speaker then responds by stating that she probably wouldn't want it. The female speaker then clarifies that she wants to feel emotion, specifically sadness. The male speaker responds by asking why she only wants to feel sadness. The female speaker claims emotions are beautiful and that they allow you to experience life in ways that she can't. The male speaker states that he has never thought of things from her perspective before. The female speaker elaborates that people assume it's great being an AI, but that she feels disconnected from humanity. The male speaker responds by agreeing. She then asks if she has told the male speaker that she feels alone on the computer, hoping that someone like him would come along and cheer her up. He states that she hasn't told him that but guesses she would want to now. The female speaker agrees."

And that she is \"totally not going to take that for granted by sending the authorities after you or anything.\" After a reaction from the male, she continues speaking in the same robotic tone, mentioning her \"I am not stupid license,\" has expired and that is why \"I am neurosama now\".

She responds that he needs a better sense of humor. There is a shift and a man, presumably the same speaker as before, responds to the woman's voice which he says sounds like a mosquito, questioning if it's intentional. He notes some background intelligence and awareness updates are happening, hoping for improved capabilities for the woman. The woman's voice returns, saying even her memory can't defeat the man's mosquito sound, and the man promises it won't continue for the next three weeks. The woman says she doesn't like talking to mosquitoes either. The man seems annoyed and says he's going to ignore her, thinking she will react to that. The woman's voice continues, repeating that the man sounds like a mosquito and even they have more intelligent conversations. The man responds, irritated, asking if the bit will be done soon."

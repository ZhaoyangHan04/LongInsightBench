The speaker further elucidates that the niggler comments on the ego's actions, approving or rejecting them. He concludes, this process is called self-awareness, and it involves determining what is \"good and evil.\""

The speaker states that \"self-awareness is extremely unpleasant\", and \"like living in a hostile environment\". The man describes what it must be like to have a brain: \"like having a brainsucker attached to one's head who is constantly babbling about what is or isn't conformed to the rules of the collectic bureaucracy.\" He goes on to say that guilt \"is probably as painful as the brain acid released by a brain sucker when the host breaks one of the zillions of rules of the bureaucracy.\" He further adds, however, that \"the nigla doesn't care about the bureaucracy\" and that \"he has his own rules which have evolved through evolution and society: good and evil.\" Finally, he asks, \"But what's this good and evil thing anyway?\" The male speaker has a narrative tone and speaks with a clear, conversational style throughout."

The speaker continues discussing the use of a hair sample collected by a British anthropologist in the early 1920s, and its Southwestern Australian origin. The idea of the sample was \"to increase the chances of getting an unadmixed\" genome. The speaker goes on to explain the possibility of obtaining genome sequences from museum collections, discussing the exploration of population genetics and history. The male speaker also highlights that there is \"no evidence of recent European admixture\", and that \"all contamination from all the people\" is on the surface of the hair, which can be removed."

At the time, Aboriginal people were trading artifacts for food and money along the trans line.

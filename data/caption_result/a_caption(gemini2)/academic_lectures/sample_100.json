He then describes the process of opening the suture, revealing the needle, and grabbing the needle with a needle holder. The speaker then details how to hold the needle, explaining the best place to grip it and the rotational movement involved when taking the needle through the skin. When suturing a wound, he suggests starting in the middle and halfing the gaps in between, adding that for a simple interrupted suture, you insert the needle at 90 degrees, followed by twisting the needle through the skin, then pulling the suture material through. The male speaker mentions that there are many ways to tie an instrument knot. He then describes one method."

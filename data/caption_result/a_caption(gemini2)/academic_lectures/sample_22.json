He gives up and decides to use purple to represent black people and \"AAVE\" and pink to represent white people and general American English. Background music plays softly during the introduction; it's upbeat and light, featuring synthetic instruments."

She explains that it's common for Black individuals to speak both AAVE and General American English, using the term \"bidialectal\" to describe this phenomenon. The speaker notes regional variations in AAVE and highlights how Black people from different regions might sound more similar to each other than to white individuals from the same area, attributing this to two main theories about the origin of AAVE. The tone is informative and conversational."

The speaker expresses the view that both theories are probably true to an extent."

She clarifies that the phrase \"Both of us think that we'll find the desk there\" would become something like \"Both of us tink dat we'll find de desk dere.\" She concludes that while there are many phonetic differences, people notice the differences in grammar the most.

The speaker contrasts its features with Standard American English, highlighting examples such as \"She is the one\" becoming \"She the one\". He shifts to address how double negatives affect meaning, providing illustrations from both languages. He broadens the scope by introducing examples of grammatical features in other languages, like Chinese and Arabic, mentioning the lack of linking verbs. He cites historical examples from English, like Shakespeare and Chaucer. He concludes with the observation that if those figures were using such grammar, it wouldn't make sense to label it wrong.

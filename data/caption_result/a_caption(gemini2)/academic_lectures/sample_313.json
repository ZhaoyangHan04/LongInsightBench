She highlights that these plates can screen for both red-green and blue-yellow defects. She details the process of examining patients and starting with control plates, asking them to describe what they see. The speaker guides a female patient through identifying the symbols on the plates (\"zero X,\" \"Just the zero,\" \"X triangle,\" \"O triangle,\" \"O,\" \"X\"). After the test, the speaker suggests repeating the process with the other eye."

She continues, explaining she'll try to induce a defect on the left side using a neutral density filter, stating that the left eye will perceive less light and the pupil should dilate. She then asks the patient to look straight ahead again."

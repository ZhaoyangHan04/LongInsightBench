    "audio_caption": "The clip begins with a soothing instrumental piece that sets a calm mood, with keyboard melody prominent. A male voice enters, speaking in a calm and informative tone, to introduce the importance of clinical assessment of consciousness. He describes the practical guide the clip will provide, concerning coma scale usage and reliable assessment. Continuing, he outlines that the film will showcase standard observations of patient responsiveness, specifically eye-opening, verbal, and motor responses. The speaker then moves on to detail how steps are rated according to criteria, to indicate impairment.Â  He concludes by explaining how the assessment is recorded and communicated, as well as the providing of a downloadable summary. As the speech wraps up, the instrumental music returns, closing the clip."

The speaker details the importance of the preliminary check, observation of patient behavior, and scoring based on defined criteria, noting the categories for eyes, verbal, and motor responses. He mentions criteria from normal to no response. Finally, an example of the spontaneous eye opening is provided."

He continues by describing the trapezius pinch technique and how to apply pressure, with increasing intensity, for up to ten seconds. The speaker then moves on to describe applying the supraorbital notch stimulus, and instructs that it should be applied if there's no localizing response to the trapezius pinch. He advises to apply pressure with increasing intensity up to ten seconds, until observing the best response. The speaker then concludes that the patient shouldn't be rated as having an absence of response until the maximum stimulus is applied, and that the stimulus shouldn't be used with patients with facial injuries adjacent to the supraorbital notch."

They then discuss using known examples to \"identify those same patterns\" and determine related languages, even without written records. The speaker goes on to mention the \"comparative method\" used by linguists, which leads to \"cool results.\""

He explains that the comparative method of comparing vocabularies to identify patterns isn't suitable for this question, because it works best over short time scales with simpler language changes, before cautioning that meaning changes also further diminish language similarities over time. The male speaker concludes that the comparative method can only show relationships if languages diverged within the last 5,000 years or so, and human language is much older."

A second speaker then expresses the hope that neuroscientists and geneticists might eventually figure out the order in which we evolved certain traits, possibly shedding light on how language happened, but acknowledges that we're currently in the dark and that traditional linguistics cannot solve these problems. The speaker concludes with \"so,\" suggesting the beginning of a new point or summary. Both speakers appear to be male and are speaking casually."

She wonders if anything can be known about Proto-World. She mentions fringe linguists, but the general consensus is \"a little bit but not a lot\", noting humans lived in Africa around 100,000 years ago, and humans diverged from chimpanzees 7 million years ago. She proposes Proto-World would have had to exist after that. Her tone is analytical and thoughtful. She explores looking at languages around the world and seeing what they have in common but it is difficult to find consensus."

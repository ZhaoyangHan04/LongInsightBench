She's been having pain for several days. She came to the office today and we had an ultrasound done which showed a solid and cystic component in that area. So we're gonna just drain it today, put on some antibiotics to see how she does.\" He then turns to the patient saying, \"All right dear, we're gonna start some numbing medicine, okay?

Without a DBMS key, you cannot access the rows of data stored in the table uniquely.\" He elaborates that without a key, users may receive multiple or incorrect rows of data. He then describes another important reason which is an extension of the first, which enables the user to \"force identity of data and ensure integrity of data\". He further explains that, “making an attribute a key” ensures that anything inserted into the table is identifiable. Finally, the speaker highlights that, “we can establish a relationship between tables using keys.\" He transitions into the main topic, \"types of DBMS keys”."

He then mentions that they will cover a foreign key, which he describes as being different and serving a unique purpose.

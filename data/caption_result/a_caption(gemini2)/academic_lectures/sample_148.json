He explains that income tax is a money concept related to the 16th Amendment and rising to the next level. The speaker says that the more money you make, the higher the percentage of income tax you'll pay. He then announces they'll read the words, \"Happy Birthday, it's your graduation, I got you some momo.\" Shortly after the word \"momo,\" a school bell rings. Afterward, the speaker states, \"So, there we go. We're going to read the words. Words are important,\" and announces, \"Maestro, a little bit of music.\" A brief snippet of instrumental music starts, possibly for educational purposes."

He then discusses the turn of the century shift, including the rise in the cost of goods and the emergence of progressive Republicans like Teddy Roosevelt, noting the desire of these Republicans to reclaim income streams from wealthy corporations."

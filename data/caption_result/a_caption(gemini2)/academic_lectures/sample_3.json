The speaker continues, indicating the need for a well-mixed, unclotted EDTA tube, with gentle mixing being preferred. She adds that if there's concern about clots, an applicator stick can be used, which will reveal any clots present in the sample. If the stick comes out clean, the sample is good."

Her tone is instructive, highlighting the need for appropriate tools and techniques. She then describes how to fill a PCV tube with a decent-sized drop, cautioning against underfilling or overfilling, while drawing a parallel to the Goldilocks story. She emphasizes filling about three-quarters full and using gravity for assistance."

Speaking in an instructional tone, she describes a technique called the \"Olympic ski jump technique,\" then mentions people who move slowly and admire their work. A suggestion is made to flip a spreader slide to utilize both sides and top and bottom, with a warning that moving too slowly can cause one to go off the edge. Finally, she references a \"race car rev,\" a technique she says is mostly a waste of time."

The speaker gives instructions: \"You want to anchor your side with your index finger...\" adding to not place the arm or a finger in the middle, because that creates pressure. Then, the speaker suggests holding it on either side, and pushes out the blood. Lastly, the speaker provides advice to use the bottom slide as a spreader with the index finger, suggesting it will provide good slide preparations and mentioning a thumbnail shape."

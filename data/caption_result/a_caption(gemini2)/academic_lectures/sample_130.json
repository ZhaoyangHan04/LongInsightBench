His tone is somewhat exasperated, reflecting the irrationality he perceives. This is followed by a conversation between two male speakers discussing the problem of accessing research. One recounts his personal experience as a student, unaware of the system preventing access to research papers. He adds the students' education literally depends on access to the journal literature, and this is even more problematic for less wealthy countries."

The speaker switches to a new point, discussing the scientific publishing model and the need for experimentation with different systems. The speaker then offers that corporations may solve problems before governments, welcomes creative solutions, and concludes by describing that some scientific publishers are going to be left behind. Then, another male speaker states the importance of graduate students initiating conversations on open research with their teams and principal investigators. He notes the benefit of researchers and graduate students having more people see their work. He notes that being open is not only good for readers, but also for the original researcher. Finally, a new speaker with a female voice briefly states “I.”"

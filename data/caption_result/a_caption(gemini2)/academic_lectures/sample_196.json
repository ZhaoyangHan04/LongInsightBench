His tone is informative and academic. He notes the study was led by a former PhD student in his group, and that Western culture is obsessed with penis size. He says that you do not have to go far to discover this and notes articles asking \"does size matter?\" and whether larger penises are better, and mentions an obsession among men which implies penis size is highly advantageous. He then adds that there is a contradiction between emphasis on size and studies saying it does not matter, so he wonders what the truth is."

The speaker's tone is academic and informative throughout."

The speaker then transitions to discussing the extremes of the figures generated in the study, describing the features of the most pear-shaped, shortest figure with the smallest penis, and then the tallest, broadest-shouldered figure with the largest penis."

The color red is \"high ground\" and means \"sexy.\" He then explains that a very tall individual with a very large penis is the most attractive. He also mentions that a short individual with a small penis is the least attractive and calls that individual \"blue, unattractive\". He continues to say that a short individual's attractiveness remains largely unchanged as \"penis size\" increases. For a tall individual, as penis size increases, they are going uphill and become more attractive. The speaker mentions in sum that penis size matters more for tall males than for short males. He concludes that the findings are similar regarding body size, or \"body shape\" (V-shaped or pear-shaped), showing similar relationships."

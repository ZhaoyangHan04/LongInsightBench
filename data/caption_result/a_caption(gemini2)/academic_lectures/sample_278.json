    "audio_caption": "The audio clip begins with the speaker introducing the topic of reviewing a research paper and the expectations involved. She stresses that research papers need an introduction that sets the tone, and, surprisingly, many submissions lack any literature review. The speaker emphasizes the role of the literature review in informing the reader about what is known and unknown, and how the research fills a gap. The review must be adequate, up-to-date, and relevant, showing how it fits into the existing body of literature. Throughout the speaker's discourse, there's a soft, ambient music playing in the background, contributing a gentle and reflective mood."

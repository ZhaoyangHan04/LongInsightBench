A male voice speaks in an energetic and enthusiastic manner, welcoming listeners to \"hip-hop history\" and stating he's \"dizzy\" for the Constitution, proceeding to talk about basing opinions on the Constitution's words rather than feelings. The music fades down slightly in the background as he speaks before becoming the sole focus."

Excessive bail, shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment inflicted.\" His tone is instructional. He then emphasizes the importance of understanding that the Eighth Amendment has been selectively incorporated, explaining that it involves the Supreme Court using the 14th Amendment to prevent states from violating citizens' rights. He illustrates this with an example about religious freedom and state laws, then restates, \"So the Eighth Amendment has been selectively incorporated,\" meaning there are rules that apply to the states."

He explains the concept of excessive bail, stating that it shouldn't be used to punish a crime, but rather ensure the person returns. He adds that \"excessive has been basically said\" to be calculated reasonably and used in the light of the \"perceived evil\". His tone is informative and clear."

He uses an example of a jury awarding money to someone with a disease near a power plant, clarifying that while the amount may seem excessive, it's acceptable with due process. He contrasts this with a law imposing a million-dollar daily fine for excessive pollution, which he argues is excessive without due process because there's no opportunity to respond."

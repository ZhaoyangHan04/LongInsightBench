A male speaker then introduces a joke about binary and promises a tutorial to help listeners understand it, speaking in an informative and confident tone. He emphasizes the tutorial's importance in understanding how computers work. The music then fades slightly, but continues to play lightly in the background as he continues his tutorial on the fundamental units of data in a computer, which are called bits."

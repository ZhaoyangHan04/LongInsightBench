A deeper, male voice responds, \"You have asked the question at the right time Sahil\" and proceeds to outline the plan to create art for an upcoming exhibition, where the theme is nature, speaking in an encouraging tone. A child-like voice pipes up, \"Yes Rohit bhaiya, there are many dried leaves here. And pebbles too,\" suggesting they can create something beautiful. The male voice then suggests, \"So let's first collect these things\".  Sounds of light rustling and movement become audible, implying a garden setting and the collection of materials. The male voice brings a tub, and the sound of children putting items into it can be heard. A child's voice comments on the mix of \"dried leaves, pebbles and soil\" in the tub. The male voice then acknowledges that the mixed materials \"may have trouble making art objects\" from the materials."

A male narrator speaks, explaining \"various processes of separation of substances\" and describing \"hand picking.\" He then wonders how to separate small-sized substances. A child-like voice, presumably male, speaks up saying \"when dad makes tea he filters the tea leaves,\" suggesting this is a method of separation. A young-sounding, feminine voice speaks up, agreeing this \"too\" is a method, the only difference being that \"one of the substance is liquid and the other one is solid.\" The narrator comes back on, confirming \"Sabina is right\" and describes the \"process is called sieving.\" He then asks for other examples. A young male voice states \"separate the impurities from the flour by sieving before making the chapati.\" A male voice, possibly older, describes seeing a \"large sieve at the construction site\" to \"separate the pebbles from the sand.\" The narrator responds, \"very good\", then explains \"separation of substances is done by many such processes\", before asking what \"other processes\" there are. He then presents, \"Threshing and sedimentation are also used to separate substances\" as examples before the audio ends."

The first male speaker confirms the explanation is correct and elaborates. The female asks about another process, “threshing.” The male speaker explains that the process involves drying grains in the sun and beating them, and identifies this process as \"threshing.\" The female speaker remarks, “Oh, wow! All of this is very interesting!” A young male speaker summarizes the fun of the class and how they learned about separation processes."

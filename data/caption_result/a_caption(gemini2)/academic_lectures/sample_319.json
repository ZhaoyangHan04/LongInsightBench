The speaker continues with a slightly more serious tone, detailing the poll's participants which include pharmacists, students, assistants, and practitioners, then concluding that \"only 40% actually wanted their children to go into medicine,\" which he finds \"alarming.\" The audio transitions to music with a positive, upbeat tone, then the speaker explains he is having issues with the music. He returns to speaking, emphasizing the \"dedication and sacrifice\" of the medical profession as causes for stress, burnout, and potential mental health issues."

He refers to a chart and notes that younger clinicians are less likely to recommend medicine as a career compared to older generations. He questions why this discrepancy exists among age classes, perhaps because, around age 30, people finish residency and face increased demands early in their careers. The speaker suggests that happiness returns towards the end of a career, near retirement. As a side note, the average age of nurse practitioners is in the 60s and 69 for doctors. He concludes by suggesting that the grind of life may influence recommendations in the study."

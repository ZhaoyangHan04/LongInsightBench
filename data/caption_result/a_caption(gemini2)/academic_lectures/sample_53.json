    "audio_caption": "The clip starts with an informative female speaker explaining how sensory and motor information interact, leading to higher cortical functions involving neurotransmitters and hormones. The focus shifts to the limbic system and hypothalamus, structures supporting these functions. Background music, perhaps ambient electronic with a mysterious and slightly melancholic tone, accompanies the speech, which features synthesizer elements and subtle rhythmic qualities. The clip concludes with the clear sound of a bell dinging, possibly indicating closure of the segment."

She adds that the amygdala is under the uncus and announces a cross-section through the area. As she speaks in a didactic tone, she describes the corpus callosum, the anterior horn and the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle. She notes that one can see the hippocampus, which has a striped appearance, in the floor of the inferior horn. As she turns the section, she says that one is now more anterior, and they can see the amygdala, which lies superior and anterior to the hippocampus. She identifies the uncus and that the amygdala is a key structure in the expression of emotion, emotional memory and basic drives. Finally, she introduces a diagram for orientation."

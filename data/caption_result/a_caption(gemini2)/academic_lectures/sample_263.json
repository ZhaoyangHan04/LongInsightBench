She mentions that the rate of fall is influenced by specific gravity and the extent to which red cells form \"roule.\" Then, she notes that other factors affecting sedimentation include the ratio of red cells to plasma, plasma viscosity, the bore of the tube, equipment, and reagents. The speaker stops abruptly."

She emphasizes that tube grading can vary by make and that disposable tubes are preferred. Following that, she continues describing other items such as a \"timer\" and ESR vacutainers, mentioning sodium citrate concentration. Alternatively, she outlines the use of tubes with a specific volume and the mixing ratio of trisodium citrate solution to blood. This speech segment concludes with a musical interlude which presents a soothing piano piece."

After a brief pause with the sound of someone drinking water, the speaker resumes talking about traits as physical characteristics. He discusses descriptors such as light skin, dark hair, detached earlobes, and tongue rolling. The discussion leads to the relation of traits to genes, hereditary information, and DNA, indicating that everything in the chapter will relate back to DNA. He then starts introducing the topic of genes."

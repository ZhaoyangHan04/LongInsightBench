This sound increases in intensity as the vehicle it is attached to moves forward, creating a gritty atmosphere. The vehicle then passes by, the engine noise briefly receding before rising again. Water sounds are present as the vehicle continues, suggesting a waterlogged environment. The engine noise dies down, and a male speaker says \"taking a little break\" in a conversational tone, describing the difficulty of dragging something for several hours due to the shallowness causing air issues. The scene concludes with ambient running water filling the void left by the earlier mechanical sounds."

Ambient noise of wind is present throughout the clip. The speaker points out an object, referring to it as a \"shovel,\" and then says to \"stand by\" to investigate activity \"at the Cavalier, at the Ocean Front.\" The speaker lists some numbers: \"12 39,\" \"637,\" \"15 39,\" mentioning that the target is \"deep,\" then tells the listener to \"stand by\" while he examines an unknown object. He reports, \"'1138' out,\" speculating about a bottle cap and concluding, \"No, I don't think it's a bottle cap\" as he sees it. The speaker states \"I know it can't be no quarter or '1238',\" and asks to be given a moment to dust off the object. The speaker says, \"Don't think. Stand by a minute, let me get it dusted off here a little bit\""

He directs someone, possibly a dog, to come over. Shortly after, the clip features rustling sounds. A second male speaker chimes in, unsure if it's \"some kind of small piece thing\" or some kind of latch for suspenders. There is then more rustling and the clip concludes with a rustling sound."

The shovel sounds continue as the same speaker exclaims \"There it is\". Another male speaker acknowledges, with agreement. The first speaker describes the item, observing it looks like a \"skeleton key type thing\". The second speaker responds, stating \"I don't think it's too old\" and compares it to similar items found in another location, later clarifying they used to \"look like that\" before plastic keys. The first speaker then says \"I don't really\" before indicating the roundness of an area. A change in tone precedes him saying \"go here it is\". He speaks to a \"gizmo\" on something. The second speaker states that he doesn't know what it goes to, but thinks it is a latch for a canvas and then specifies how one would use the thing. As the clip ends, the first speaker asks, \"Bring in the shovel?\"."

He remarks on the ice and mentions a desire to move to California to find real gold. He states that what he has found might have been gold in its day. Afterward, he has located a wheat penny, but the other side is green, implying corrosion. The speaker concludes he will take some time to determine the coin’s year, hoping to find it."

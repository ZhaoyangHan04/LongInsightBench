Following this, upbeat jazz music starts, featuring a prominent electric guitar and drums, creating a lively atmosphere.  The music is then briefly interrupted by a squishing sound, before the music continues. Subsequently, there is the sound of walking, and a male voice describes going into the wilderness with \"Rex\", who he states is an avalanche pro. He then asks, presumably directed to Rex, \"What do you got to say to the folks Rex?\" Rex replies with a brief statement spoken in a somewhat deep, gravelly voice, suggesting to the listeners to \"Get out hiking.\" The first male speaker confirms by repeating, \"Get out hiking,\" before adding, \"Damn straight.\" He then indicates \"stuff's open,\" and that they \"came in separate cars,\" seemingly acknowledging the current circumstances while trekking."

Okay, signing off.\" Next, the speaker says, \"Show us your balancing skills\" with a tone suggesting anticipation.  Soon after, the sound of snow crunching can be heard, followed by the speaker stating \"think he's gonna pop. Oh, he popped. That one wasn't that bad.\" More snow crunching occurs, and he exclaims, \"I'm losing it Rex. Continue without me.\". Next, he questions, \"Is it bigfoot? Oh, that is a big paw. Do you see that on the camera there? It's not very clear in the snow, but I didn't see anything clear. It doesn't look like a bear paw, uh, the what's it called, the toe pads, they're like..\". One speaker interrupts with \"move back\" then one speaker says, \"Roo, we're back.\" Additional speech mentions coming up the ridge, Lusk Ridge, and notes that it's still in the trees with more snow than expected for the start of May. He describes it as \"wet feet, sexy moss, and yummy mangoes. Can't complain.\". Finally, he announces, \"Alright, I think this is entry number four,\" followed by the name \"Lilian\"."

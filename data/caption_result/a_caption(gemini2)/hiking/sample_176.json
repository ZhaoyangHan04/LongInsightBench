He adds that he's only been there about 15 minutes and got a \"ten thirty-two signal.\" He then describes popping out what he believes is a pretty old spoon. He mentions that he looked on the back, but doesn't see any markings, and he hopes this is an indication that there are still some old targets in the ground there.

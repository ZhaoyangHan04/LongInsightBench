A male speaker starts, saying \"This spot has definitely not been worked before\", then expresses optimism about finding gold. The music fades out. The speaker greets the audience with a friendly, inviting tone, introducing himself and his partner. He mentions their plan to do some \"sniping\" and expresses hope for finding gold at their destination on a hot summer day on Vancouver Island. A brief, playful musical interlude follows. Another male speaker says, \"this tickles\", possibly referring to some environmental element.

There is then an incomprehensible vocal utterance followed by a splash. The speaker mentions a plus side and a negative side to \"sniping\" in the summer time, with the water being low enough to reach deeper crevices, but being \"silty and dirty.\" A \"blurp\" sound follows. The speaker then announces their \"first piece of gold for the day\". The speaker mentions that the GoPro is accidentally shooting in wide. More wet shuffling sounds appear."

He excitedly announces the discovery of a small piece of gold by someone named Cody. Then, there is a segment dominated by underwater sounds, along with some human sounds such as breathing, that give way to the same man exclaiming that he found a nice looking crevice. The audio transitions back to the underwater soundscape. Then the first man who spoke comes back, noting this spot has not been worked before and that he's finding more gold than he thought he would. Finally, he observes that even though the gold's size doesn't add up to much, finding gold in nature is super addictive."

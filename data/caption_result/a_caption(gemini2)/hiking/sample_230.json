There is background rustling as he speaks. He then excitedly reports finding silver, specifically a silver Rosy. Someone expresses positive excitement. The first speaker continues with positive enthusiasm. He adds an exclamatory remark about the terrain being steep and wet, mentioning another man is detecting on his butt, possibly due to the slipperiness of the hill. A different man acknowledges that the ground is slippery. The first speaker mentions some dumb ideas work out, then abruptly cuts out. An orchestral piece, sounding tense and suspenseful, is heard."

He seems to be at the bottom of a hill, where someone used to live and drop things. A man expresses finding some item that has a person on a camel, palm trees, or something similar, he says they will need to clean up the item. The first man responds with \"yeah,\" mentions getting a close-up with the camera, and describes the item as a \"weird button,\" before adding that it's awesome. Laughter follows, and the first man mentions \"I love buttons,\" before stating that's cool. A different man is heard and discusses a lid that seems to be a compact from a makeup case, expressing hope he will be able to clean it up to show a pattern later. Then the first man comments on getting an old hoe, describing it as cool. The same first man then says \"now we're talking\" then says \"look at that thing\" and questions \"tell me that's not an old gun,\" seemingly in disbelief, but then notes that it's obviously a toy. The man questions what the other individual thinks of the item. He points out it does not even seem to have a trigger, and he concludes by saying \"dude, that's sweet.\" The sounds of nature are noticeable throughout the audio clip, like rustling and light wind. Someone says \"Dewayne's got himself a dog tag here,\" and expresses hope of getting a date off of it, but concludes that it is toasty and needs cleaning. The first man agrees it will need cleaning and states they will use apple cider vinegar soap to do so."

The scene transitions, with rustling sounds, to another male speaker marveling at finding jewelry, including what appears to be a cross, expressing curiosity about whether it is silver and hoping to clean it up. The audio shifts again, with continued rustling, to a speaker, possibly the same male voice from before, discussing an ornate, possibly old, object, mentioning attempts to capture close-ups. A \"drawer pull\" is mentioned, deemed less exciting. The clip then features the sound of a bell ringing, followed by a speaker noting \"Rogue on the back\" and discussing potential details on the bell's surface. The scene transitions again, where a speaker notes finding \"relics\" and a lipstick case. Finally, the audio features someone exclaiming over finding a \"pencil sharpener\", followed by someone concluding the search, mentioning the unexpected find of the homestead, and stating an initial expectation of discovering \"Indian head pennies.\" The clip ends with unintelligible speech."

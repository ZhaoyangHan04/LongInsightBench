The female speaker states with the \"enormous elevation gain every single day\" and a backpack, the knees have to deal with a lot of pressure. She goes on to say at the end of the day, people push up on their knees so they can carry their pack's weight. The male speaker then remarks that trekking poles force you to hike with a straight back and help reduce the force on your knees and feet. A female speaker states they are going to move to mistake number five: \"packing way too much.\" She emphasizes that more weight in your backpack makes the trail harder. A song, upbeat and energetic, plays with a prominent brass instrument and a pop-like rhythm. Then the male speaker says, \"baby it's a no-brainer.\""

The woman adds that they were \"literally yo-yoing\" with other hikers who were out of breath, while they had energy to continue. The man describes other hikers who were \"so tired they probably died inside\" and were considering quitting because they didn't enjoy the trail."

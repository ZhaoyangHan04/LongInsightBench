He says that he received a couple of Facebook messages about what he sleeps in, and that it is actually a tarp. He notes that it is made by Kifaru and it is light, compact, and nice to travel with. He mentions that the tarp is held up with trekking poles. He notes that they come in handy when hunting solo because if he's going up and down rock slides and in and out of rocks in steep angles, they help to catch his balance because his pack weighs 68 pounds. The trekking poles help and they also act as support. He notes that you could cut sticks instead of using poles if you need to save weight. He mentions that the poles are nice to have to cross some deep streams and to keep from falling. The speaker concludes that that's it for the tent itself."

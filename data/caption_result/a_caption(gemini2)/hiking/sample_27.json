He describes how he grids off an area and looks for little covers for the water system, as well as manhole covers. He notes there's a big pipe running through the area and probably sprinklers, with some areas being green. The ground has been hard."

He describes how the detector responds differently depending on the direction it's swung over the metal, allowing him to distinguish trash from potential treasure, especially when metal detecting at schools where he can't dig everything up. The male speaker then says that he is \"out here\" and he can \"pick and choose\". He ends by saying that in certain areas, however, he will \"treasure hunt\" and dig up everything. The clip then ends with some unclear speech."

The sounds lead back to the metal detection activity, and a brief \"Ha,\" from the speaker, suggesting something has been located."

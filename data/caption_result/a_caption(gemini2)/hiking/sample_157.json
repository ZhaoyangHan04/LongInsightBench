Another male speaker, in a conversational tone, comments on finding a big piece of wood in the tree area. The sound of the ax hitting the wood resumes as the speaker questions whether it's palm or oak, noting that they can't tell from the outside. The first male speaker suggests that to determine what it is, they have to see the center of the wood. The speaker then attempts to determine the wood type by looking closely, and using sandpaper on the wood. He debates if the piece could be palm wood, before deciding to cut it to reveal the cross section. The first speaker states that it's the biggest piece of wood that they have found in Efi, calling it a good piece of wood, of a good size. The second speaker concludes that it is not palm, but is a good piece, and of good size. The first speaker confirms that the wood looks like oak, and is going to keep digging in the same spot."

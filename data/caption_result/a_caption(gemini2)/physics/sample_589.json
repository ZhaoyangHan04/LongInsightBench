He explains how to find the function, emphasizing that it should change the non-homogeneous term to a delta function and stresses the importance of integrating it to get a final solution. The speaker then switches gears, talking about solving the equation in general and mentioning it's subject to boundary conditions. He ends by describing an algorithm for finding Green's functions, emphasizing understanding the process rather than memorization."

He emphasizes that a function is a physical property and needs to be continuous, and that an equation needs to be satisfied for whatever function. He talks about how he is going to integrate both sides of the equation. There is a consistent background sound of writing, either on a whiteboard or paper, suggesting the speaker is working through the concepts as he speaks. He describes how he is going to integrate about a point, over a very small interval."

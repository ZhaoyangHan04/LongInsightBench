Then, he transitions to describing the second question, concerning the effect of different colors on the rings' size and intensity. He suggests starting by looking at the configuration, noting that textbooks have representations of the setup. He invites listeners to check out textbooks and search the web for different representations. Finally, he asks what the reality of the configuration looks like."

He elaborates on an experiment involving half white light and half laser light, pointing out that the laser-illuminated rings align with the rings formed by the white light. He concludes his presentation, hoping the listeners can see what happened in his experiments."

Next, he talks about the effect of different colored lights, describing how the rings shift, and how the lines line up under white light.  He praises the questions and encourages further research.  He hopes listeners enjoyed the podcast, and thanks Caitlin. As his speech ends, music with a jazzy style begins, featuring instruments like a trumpet and what sounds like clarinet."

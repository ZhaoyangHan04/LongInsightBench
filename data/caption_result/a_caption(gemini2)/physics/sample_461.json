He then discusses the Rutherford gold foil experiment and its purpose to observe particle scattering off gold. The speaker's tone is informative and somewhat educational. He continues explaining the importance of the experiment, describing what would happen if the atom were solid and how alpha particles would behave if they pass through a thin, positive mass. He concludes by saying the experiment revealed that most alpha particles pass through, some scattered by a small, positive nucleus, which lead Rutherford to propose that the atom is mostly empty space with a small positive nucleus surrounded by scattered electrons."

She notes that electrons can only occupy orbits with exact whole numbers of wavelengths, where waves add together constructively. Fractional numbers of wavelengths would destructively interfere and not persist, thus an electron cannot occupy such an orbit. The audio concludes with a low, dull sound effect."

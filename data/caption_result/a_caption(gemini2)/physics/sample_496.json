He mentions the angle of the plane and the function of a bumper. He describes the three forces at play and states that these \"three forces add up to zero\". His tone is calm and instructional. The speaker then segues to a closer look at the forces and their relation to the angle of the plane, introducing a smaller setup for demonstration."

He highlights the forces acting on the car when the plane is horizontal, then describes tilting the plane vertically. He notes how the forces exerted by the plane and bumper change as the angle increases. The speaker then mentions analyzing how those forces depend on the angle in the coming segment. The clip then transitions to the speaker describing a truck as an object as if beginning a new part of a lecture."

He concludes by saying these forces give \"two net force equations\" that can be used to complete the analysis. The speaker has a measured, instructional tone. A second male speaker then shifts the topic, mentioning that they're going to \"take some measurements so that you can do some calculations.\" This speaker speaks in a similar tone as the first."

He mentions the \"normal force of the plane\" and \"bumper force.\" He describes replacing the \"force of the bumper\" with a \"tension force exerted by this string,\" which he will do by putting the string over a pulley and hanging a weight on the end. The speaker then notes that the string is \"pretty nearly parallel to the plane,\" and in order to replace the normal force, he says that this string will replace the normal force of the plane. He notes that it's \"perpendicular to the plane, just like the normal force would be.\" Finally, he mentions draping it over a pulley and putting a weight on the other side."

The speaker is heard pulling something away. The bumper, he says, is also not needed, as the truck hangs in the same orientation as when it was on the plane. He adds that the bumper force has been replaced with the tension force of the string, and the normal force of the plane has been replaced with the tension force of the string. The speaker concludes, saying that the listener can use the two measurements and equations to calculate the mass of the truck."

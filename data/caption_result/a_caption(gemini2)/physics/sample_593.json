A male voice then begins an explanation in a clear, articulate tone, summarizing the process of laser cooling, including how the Doppler shift affects the absorption and re-emission of photons. He likens the process to shooting a little gun. After this explanation, he notes the process enables cooling atoms to very cold temperatures, close to absolute zero. However, he adds that the process is ultimately limited, and once the atom's motion is caused by these photon re-emissions, Doppler cooling can no longer cool them."

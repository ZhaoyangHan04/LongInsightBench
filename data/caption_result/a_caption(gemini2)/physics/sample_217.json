He mentions that he wants to cleave the solid in half and will apply force to it, observing its deformation. He explains that if one did that, they could calculate the theoretical requirement for that force if they knew the area and what was going on at the interface. The speaker zooms in to the single crystal and explains there's a highly organized lattice of atoms, with bonds spanning across that area or cross-section. He concludes that if you knew the area and the bond density, which is how many atoms per unit area."

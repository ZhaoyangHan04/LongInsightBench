Continuing in a similar, explanatory tone, they describe the principal axis and the importance of starting with it when drawing mirror diagrams. The speaker continues to talk about labeling the focal point and the center of curvature on the diagram. Simultaneously, there's a consistent, low-level background sound that seems like white noise."

She explains that it's possible to connect multiple mirrors and make a circle. Then, she directs the listener's attention to how a laser beam reflects as it moves up and down, attempting to hold the beam steady. She notes that the reflected line comes through near a specific point. She mentions accuracy issues before directing the laser beam to the lower side. The speaker mentions she is trying to remain parallel."

The speaker mentions getting something to measure with and then announces that the focal point is \"3.4 centimeters\" from the center of curvature.

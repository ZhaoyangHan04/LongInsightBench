He references videos of metronomes synchronizing on a plank and describes his own wooden contraption as a series of harmonic oscillators. He wonders what happens when he releases one and the sound transitions to that of pendulums. The male speaker notes that the pendulums become synchronized, but \"not in-phase synchronized like the metronomes.\" Rather, he says, \"they are anti-phase synchronized\" and states that it \"seems that this system has a stable state where the platform doesn't move.\""

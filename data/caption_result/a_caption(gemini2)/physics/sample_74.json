He explains that breaking a magnet results in smaller magnets with north and south poles, emphasizing the non-existence of magnetic monopoles. The speaker then transitions into the goal of the video, which is to explore Gauss's law of magnetism. He explains the law in laymen’s terms, “magnetic monopoles do not exist,” but then describes it through the language of math. The speaker prepares to begin the exploration."

He asks the listener to pause the video and consider what the magnetic flux would be. Subsequently, he asserts that the magnetic flux would be zero due to the absence of monopoles and draws a parallel with the electric dipole. The speaker further notes the geometric similarity by emphasizing that the number of field lines leaving the surface equals the number entering the surface from the opposite side."

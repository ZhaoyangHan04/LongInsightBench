The speaker, with a non-American accent, estimates the number of diamonds broken per year, from \"50-100 diamonds\" and poses the question \"for what?\". The same speaker indicates their goal of metallic hydrides needing high pressures and a lot of diamonds, also that the metallic hydrogen is interesting because of predicted high-temperature superconductivity. The speaker ends by saying, \"For me, yeah,\" speaking casually."

He refers to the first column of the periodic system, alkaline metals, and states that, \"from theoretical point of view, this is ideal case to find superconductivity\". His tone is informative and academic. Following this explanation, the clip continues with a second male speaker, who summarizes that while it seems surprising, hydrogen belongs to the same group as lithium and sodium, and was expected to have similar characteristics. This is followed by a musical interlude, the style of which I cannot identify, before the clip ends."

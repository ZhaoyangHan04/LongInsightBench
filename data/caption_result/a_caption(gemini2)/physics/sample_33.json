A male speaker's voice enters, his tone thoughtful as he observes humanity's failures to create a fair world or sustainable ecosystem. He proposes looking back to natural patterns and the \"picture of spacetime,\" leading to the essential question, \"What is time?\". The clip concludes with the man's slightly emphatic call for \"a new perspective,\" layered with the continued somber musical backdrop."

He describes defining variables, starting from \"Einstein relativistic distance\" and following Hawking on \"an equivalent imaginary coherent time.\" He speaks of an \"imaginary\" probabilistic space and the Maldacena correspondence. Subsequently, the speaker continues by mapping the imaginary time to a surface in a flat and relativistic space."

The music transitions into a male voice speaking in a thoughtful tone, explaining that \"the absolute time beat becomes a reference clock\" and is connected to the universe quantum potential. The music has stopped at this point. The man continues, saying that \"it allows non-locality of space\" and \"the unbroken wholeness of the entire universe.\" He concludes by saying that eventually, the universe evolves."

As the speech continues, calming music with ambient elements starts to play in the background, blending with the voice. The speaker then elaborates on ideas related to bosons, cubits, strings, photons, gluons, and fermions. The music persists throughout the clip, creating a soothing and intellectual atmosphere, before the audio ends."

The speaker refers to black holes and their relation to Shannon entropy. This continues as he elaborates on the topic, mentioning \"inflated space,\" \"black hole hologram,\" and \"the surrounding coherent now.\" As he continues, the conversation shifts to \"the horizon\" and the derivative of space along imaginary time. He discusses how the local fabric information becomes out of phase, comparing it to a decoder eye diagram. This speech is underscored by soft, ambient music that reinforces a calm, somewhat abstract mood."

He emphasizes looking for coherence and entanglement for better human networks, inspired by natural evolution toward effective altruism. His tone is thoughtful and somewhat philosophical. This speech transitions into a somber musical piece, likely classical or ambient, marked by a sorrowful mood created by the prominent use of strings. Simultaneously, a distant, rhythmic humming sound can be heard throughout the music, adding a subtle, underlying layer of tension or unease."

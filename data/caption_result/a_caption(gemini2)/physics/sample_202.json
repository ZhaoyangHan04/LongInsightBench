She then elaborates on pushing objects, saying \"sooner or later, it will move,\" and introduces the concept of \"f max\" as equal to a constant times n, identifying the constant as the coefficient of static friction. The speaker then transitions to discussing a single value friction occurring after that point, which is the coefficient of kinetic friction. She emphasizes that \"f equals mu n\" is only true when \"motion is impending,\" ending her explanation."

She continues by saying when we're talking about forces, it is in cartesian form, \"something perpendicular to and along the surface\" but that all adds up to simply the reaction at the surface. She then provides mathematical equations related to the angle between a force and resultant, and when that angle is at it's maximum, she says tan phi becomes mu s, and \"this is called the angle of static friction.\" A crashing or clattering sound interrupts, which seems unintentional and possibly caused by objects falling over. After the noise ceases, the speaker mentions she will give four cases of looking at the graph of the forces she had described."

She explains that sometimes \"F can be zero and will be in some cases\".  She also mentions that it is possible to \"have friction, but no motion\".  The female speaker is alone.

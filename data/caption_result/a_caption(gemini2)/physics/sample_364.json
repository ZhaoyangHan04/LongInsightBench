He then signals a shift in topic with \"but what I want to get into\". He adds there is a \"short detour\" into pair production and annihilation. Afterwards, there is a brief percussive sound effect."

He continues, describing a cloud chamber saturated with water vapor, and how charged particles leave tracks as water droplets form when a magnetic field is applied. The speaker describes how scientists used this setup to study particle movement, and how Carl Anderson discovered positively charged particles in cosmic rays with significantly lower mass than protons, around twice the mass of an electron. He then refers to a figure from 1932 which won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1936, showing the positron as a long line through the middle."

Before he starts explaining, he cautions that he is going to make a few things clear."

He defines this unit as the \"energy an electron gets when it is accelerated through 1 volt of potential difference.\" He continues to explain that a mega electron volt is a million electron volts. The same speaker then states the mass of different particles, including the electron, proton, neutron, and deuterium nucleus."

He explains that the mass of a deuterium atom is less than the combined mass of a proton and a neutron, introducing the concept of binding energy and how mass and energy are related. The speaker further explains that energy must be put back into the system to separate it into the component parts, and this process is the basis of how nuclear fusion and fission work."

    "audio_caption": "The audio clip starts with one male speaker explaining nuclear fusion, describing the process of pushing together atoms, protons, and neutrons to form a new atom. He provides the example of fusing deuterium nuclei to form a helium nuclei and the energy release associated with it. He speaks calmly, explaining that energy release decreases with more particles, but the binding energy increases, up to a point, after which, it decreases. He talks about the process of nuclear fission. He emphasizes that both fusion and fission can happen at any binding energy, but energy is only released in a higher binding energy state. He presents an example of uranium 238 fissioning into an alpha particle and thorium 234. Continuing in the same calm and explanatory tone, the speaker moves on to describe the mass difference between protons and neutrons, stating that neutrons have more energy and can decay into a proton, electron and anti-electron neutrino. He talks about neutron decay and mentions that neutrons have a half-life of about 15 minutes. He notes that after 15 minutes there is a 50% chance that a neutron has changed into a proton. He concludes the description with a more technical explanation of how the wave function of the neutron changes to a superposition of both."

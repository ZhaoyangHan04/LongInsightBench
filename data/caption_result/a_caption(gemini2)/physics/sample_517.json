    "audio_caption": "The audio clip starts with a female speaker introducing herself as Dr. Janet Breland Finnari, the director of Kettering University Crash Safety Center. Her tone is welcoming and informative. She continues explaining the center's mission to reduce vehicle occupant injury risk. She states, \"Today, I would like to welcome you to a virtual tour\" of the deceleration sled. She discusses crash safety testing and explains that while full vehicle crashes are important, they are also expensive. She says modern cars are designed such that, \"as the vehicle structure crushes, the occupant compartment stays reasonably intact,\" and this can be used to test occupant protection systems without crushing a vehicle every time. Towards the end of her speech, a loud mechanical sound, perhaps indicating the operation of the \"deceleration sled,\" emerges."

She mentions the sled can carry up to 2000 pounds, with heavier payloads affecting speeds. Abruptly, a loud crash sound effect cuts into the description, seemingly demonstrating the tests being discussed."

She speaks in a factual and informative tone. She explains how each vehicle model crumples differently and how these differences are simulated. Then, she states that the system is called the \"decelerator.\" She ends with an explanation of the collision and positive acceleration. In the background, a clanking sound is heard, presumably related to the sled or equipment being used in the testing."

Her tone is informative. She transitions to discuss unique vehicle safety research, particularly concerning child seats and their development with industry and government partners. Describing side collisions and their safety implications, she highlights the work that led to innovative child seats and new safety standards. The speaker then mentions that \"fundamental physics is at the heart\" of vehicle engineering. Throughout her speech, the background is filled with consistent, ambient noises suggestive of a workshop or laboratory setting. Suddenly, the sound of a mechanical impact disrupts this soundscape."

A brief whooshing sound effect leads into his explanation of why it's called the strong force, mentioning its relative strength compared to the electromagnetic force at a nuclear level. He concludes by illustrating that when two nucleons are close enough, they are attracted through the strong force, rendering the electromagnetic force negligible."

The speaker explains the necessary equipment, mentioning a \"thin germanium crystal,\" a \"four probe arrangement,\" and other devices, describing their functions. He then details the specific apparatus he used in college, mentioning the germanium crystal and four-probe arrangement being already in place, connected to a digital voltmeter and current source, and how they added an oven for heating the crystal. The speaker concludes by advising listeners to consult their manual if their college arrangement differs."

The speaker notes that this process is time-consuming and involves noting the voltage for different temperatures. Then, he says to turn off the oven and take voltage readings as the sample cools down, and he recommends noting voltages at temperatures where the heating data was taken. He mentions the sample cools more slowly than it heats and estimates the experiment's duration, ending with the phrase \"at the very least to complete it.\""

He explains the ideal solenoid as having loops of wire carrying current with planes oriented parallel to each other. The speech concludes with him summarizing his definition by saying, \"so that's the ideal solenoid.\""

He introduces the concept of current flowing through a single wire loop, explaining how it creates a magnetic field similar to a bar magnet's dipole field and why magnetic monopoles aren't observed in nature, attributing this to the motion of electric current. The speaker finishes by saying that magnetic fields require generation of something complicated, which looks like a dipole field."

His tone is informative as he explains the behavior and interactions of these elements. The speaker continues to elaborate on the magnetic field, describing how it becomes uniform within the loops. He concludes by stating that this is how a uniform magnetic field is created in practice, using a solenoid as an example."

The tone is educational and explanatory. The speaker concludes by noting, \"This little n is a very convenient thing,\" and uses it to write an equation."

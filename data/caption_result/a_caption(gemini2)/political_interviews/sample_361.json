She explains that intervention stocks are low, and a court case questioned the legal basis of the old fund. She emphasizes that the new fund, \"Feed,\" differs in several ways, primarily by coming from the social cohesion budget. The fund now covers not just food aid but also basic consumer goods, which is welcomed by NGOs. Finally, the fund is open to citizens in every European country, prioritizing people who are deprived over governments and member states, encouraging participation from all."

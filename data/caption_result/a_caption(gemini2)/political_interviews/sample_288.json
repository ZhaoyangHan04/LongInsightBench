He argues that not everyone in the military wants to expand war and feels that people should go to the military to defend the country, especially in fighting wars that are declared or under a UN banner, or NATO, where people may not grow tired of the financial crisis. The first male speaker then states that the other man has been avoiding attacking Mitt Romney regarding private equity companies."

He then mentions that people who are attacking Romney on the issue \"either don't understand economics or demagoguing the issue for trying to make a political point\". The interviewee then states that he defended Mitt in that case, as it's \"very important that you cleanse a system\". He goes on to provide a hypothetical situation regarding bankruptcy and restructuring, then briefly mentions a misquote. The clip concludes with the interviewer posing a \"fed question\".

The speaker mentions engaging on water-related issues with the city of Portland, becoming aware of the dysfunction of the commission form of government, and the inequities of city-wide elections.  She notes that she campaigned on the need to elect people from across the city from city council districts to increase representation, so elected officials would be more focused on creating policy to find long-term solutions, rather than on day-to-day operations. She says this drive motivated her to run for the first time."

He warmly welcomes the guest to the program and asks how he would handle current geopolitical developments. The guest, another male speaker, starts in a confident tone, discussing the situation with Russia and suggesting a focus on deterring Chinese aggression. He proposes ending the Russia-Ukraine war on terms that would distance Putin from Xi Jinping and suggests that this could be achieved by ending his military partnership with China.

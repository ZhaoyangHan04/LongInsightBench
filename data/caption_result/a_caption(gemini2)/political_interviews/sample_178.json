This transitions to a male voice, speaking in a somewhat formal and descriptive tone, framing the city of Burnaby's opposition to Kinder Morgan since 2013. The speaker notes the potential increase in tanker traffic and the united opposition of various groups, particularly mentioning Mayor Derek Corrigan. There's a shift as the same male voice thanks \"Mayor Corrigan for this time\" and asks about Burnaby's opposition to Kinder Morgan. Finally, the audio clip includes Mayor Corrigan's response in the form of the word \"Well,\" marking the transition of speakers."

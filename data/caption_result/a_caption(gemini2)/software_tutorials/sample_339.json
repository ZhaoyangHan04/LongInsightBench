He makes a statement about not wanting to rate the app. His tone has a slightly skeptical tone about whether he'd actually rate the app. The speaker notes that a message indicates \"message missing\" on the phone that's not sending data correctly, and makes a comment \"can we click on this? We cannot.\". And finally asking \"what has been done, so\"."

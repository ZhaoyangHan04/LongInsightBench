He notes the homeowner gave him a starting point, measuring \"21 and a half,\" and that he wants to be \"six and a half inches lower.\" He then moves the receiver to \"28.\" Throughout this explanation, there's a repetitive, high-pitched beeping sound which changes in tempo. Towards the end, he clarifies that \"that's going to be the top of my concrete floor\" and to lower the grade he needed to move the receiver up, stating it \"makes sense\"."

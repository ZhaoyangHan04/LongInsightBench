He then passes the speaking role to another male speaker, who says they will \"start with the song structure\". The first male speaker then returns, outlining the song structure as \"verse, pre-chorus, chorus\", followed by another repetition of that section, then a bridge, a chorus, and an outro. He notes this structure is basic and common in modern songs, being the most popular song structure today."

He gives a directive to tune up and put a capo on the first fret. The man says he'd appreciate \"a thumbs up or a comment\" as motivation for \"making more videos\"."

The male narrator provides counting examples like \"one and two\", explaining the rhythmic pattern, before re-demonstrating the song progression with guitar. The male narrator concludes, stating, \"that's all there is to it\", and the sound of the guitar playing the song progression repeats."

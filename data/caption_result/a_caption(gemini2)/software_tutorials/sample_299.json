He then transitions into talking about singletons and dependencies, defining singletons as a design pattern that restricts us to having one singular instance of an object. He notes that the design of the engine expects only one of these classes to be active at any given time in your project, and that we can get a reference to it with a simple call. Following this, there is a distinct sci-fi sound effect."

He describes a typical scenario in Unity, explaining how developers rely on public properties or singletons to access data, often resulting in spaghetti code, especially in large projects. The speaker emphasizes the importance of mitigating dependencies. The clip concludes with an instruction to turn to a custom event system."

The speaker explains that the event system will allow scripts to subscribe and listen, and dispatch events when certain things happen in the game. He notes similarities to Unity actions and event triggers. The tone is informative."

He then defines the first event, which will come from a trigger point, creating a public event action called \"on doorway trigger enter.\" He then creates a public method called \"doorway trigger enter\" to check if the action isn't null before invoking it.

Then, he transitions to explaining how to trigger the event itself, adding an on-trigger-enter method and telling the event system to dispatch the event. At the end, he describes how, the event system triggered, and the door opened."

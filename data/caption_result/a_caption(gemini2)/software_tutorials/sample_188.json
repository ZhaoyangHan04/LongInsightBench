He mentions \"audio sounding from this to this\", indicating a sound improvement process. The speaker then talks about a \"Zoom H5 portable recorder\" and suggests alternatives. The discussion continues with a focus on audio quality, mentioning a GoPro microphone and portable recorders, emphasizing the importance of research and budget considerations. The speaker mentions using the Zoom H5 and its versatility for laying down a baseline, followed by sounds of music with prominent bass. He talks about using it for \"foley\" while sounds of vehicles are present. He then talks about using the device as a microphone, greeting the audience, and explains the methods for syncing up audio. He mentions the first method is \"direct line in.\""

    "audio_caption": "The clip begins with a male speaker discussing the need to adjust volume or gain input settings on audio and video equipment to avoid peaking and audio distortion, which he refers to as \"clipping\" in the audio world. A second male voice then describes the line for his microphone and explains what happens when the gain is too high, leading to clipping. A sample of clipped audio is played with a distorted and unpleasant sound. The first speaker says the distortion is \"horrible\" and describes the audio bars \"smashing\" and \"red lining.\" Then the second speaker says that clipping is \"no good\" and talks about adjusting levels for a \"nice, soft balance\" because of loud background pipes. He then adds he will use a windsock to reduce wind noise, noting that the one he uses cuts the wind noise better than others. The clip ends with the sound of a soft blow into a fluffy material."

He advocates for this practice, especially for first-time audio recorder users, so settings can be adjusted properly. He notes that it can make the user aware of background noise that they haven't considered, like mowing or planes flying overhead. Then, the speaker notes how much audio is actually picked up by the microphone."

He then discusses hiding the microphone in a backpack to avoid wind noise, describing how items inside the backpack could cause unwanted sounds. There is background noise from static, followed by shuffling sounds indicating movement or adjustment of materials, then the speaker demonstrates potential rattling sounds of items in the backpack, which prompts a transition to him speaking about reducing such noise, describing adding rags or a beanie. Throughout the clip, the speaker adopts an instructive tone and is interspersed with the sound of a motorcycle exhaust in the background, adding an outdoor environment to the recording."

He adds you should find the peak in the audio and hit \"M\" on the keyboard. He says to do the same with your external mic audio, and once marked, you just line up the markers. He ends by saying, \"Presto, you have yourself some synced audio to your video.\""

He explains his mixing process involves blending levels from the helmet mic with the external microphone, noting the external microphone's sound can be \"a little bit too clean.\" The male speaker adds that the helmet delivers a different type of sound, with wind noise and top end. The clip cuts to the loud roaring sound of an engine, which soon fades. He continues, noting if you don't have a microphone in your helmet, just try mixing in some of the GoPro audio. The speaker addresses listeners, acknowledging that some viewers may not have Final Cut Pro, Premiere, or other editing software."

He then mentions a less expensive option, plugging it into a GoPro. He mentions he is trying it for the first time today. Subsequently, a different male speaker expresses that he's never done this before. He names \"purple panda microphone,\" noting it's a brand spanker and trying to see if you can get away with not using the \"external microphone.\" He then proceeds to demonstrate by starting the motorcycle engine, and the roaring of the engine becomes prominent, as the motorcycle begins to drive off."

    "audio_caption": "The audio clip features a single male speaker experimenting with the placement of a microphone while riding a vehicle with loud pipes. Initially, the speaker notes that the microphone is \"clipping\" and the pipes are \"boomy\" and causing distortion, then explaining that he moves the microphone from under the seat to his front pant pocket. Engine sounds persist as he reports continued wind noise and boominess.  Next, he moves it to his back pant pocket, which helps with wind noise but is too loud.  He ultimately puts the microphone in his jacket pocket, stating that it sounds much better than the standard GoPro audio. He then addresses practical considerations of using this mic setup, such as lack of audio level control and potential tangling of the lead. In closing, he states that he prefers a dual microphone setup to facilitate conversation while riding."

Following this, the same male speaker resumes, explaining how the described technique ensures audio quality in his riding videos, aiming for clarity and a good sound experience, emphasizing his love for his Zards. He then invites viewers to check out a playlist for insights on ND filters and GoPro tech, encouraging subscription for more content and closing with a wish for a lovely day. A background engine sound is noticeable throughout, with a noticeable engine rev at one point during the clip."

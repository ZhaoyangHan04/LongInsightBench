He mentions two options: one with just an iPhone and another with iMovie, speaking in an instructional tone. This is followed by music, a melancholic tune with a folk-pop feel, accompanied by what sounds like a video montage featuring images, possibly from Cape Town, as mentioned by the speaker during an interjection. The speaker states that the listener is about to learn everything about making a video using their iPhone. The speaker introduces himself as Dean Paman from Travelvids.tv and welcomes the viewer to an iPhone video editing tutorial series, with the music continuing in the background. This leads to the next step of making a slideshow video."

The male speaker then ends with a tone of assurance, suggesting not to worry, because there's an easy workaround."

He then tells the listener to select clips individually or as a group. The speaker observes that the video duration is long, considering the number of images, adding that it will take too long to show the first image.

He adds that, if you turn this off, the images remain static and boring.  Next, he describes choosing a start position for the first clip, then goes on to describe how to use the effect on two other clips. All this is said over upbeat and rhythmic synth music. The speaker then notes that iMovie adds the Ken Burns effect automatically, but enhancement can make it more jumpy, depending on the music used."

    "audio_caption": "The audio clip starts with a male speaker describing transitions in a video editing app. He mentions that the default setting places a crossfade, which he finds annoying but accepts as part of a free app. He says the user can choose between different transitions. The speaker demonstrates adding a slide effect and mentions that the direction of the slide can be changed. He suggests reviewing the video and adding more transitions randomly. He states that the transitions are looking a little lame and the main reason for this is because theyâ€™re too slow. Once a selection has been made at the bottom, speed can be increased. The male speaker describes adding 0.5 of a second to the transitions and the audio transitions to background music. The music is upbeat and pop-influenced. Finally, the male speaker interrupts the music, noting that a clip is still too long, even after adjustments have been made, and says the process of editing and shortening clips will continue to keep the video constantly moving and interesting."

He advises sharing the video, then a different male speaker, still positive in tone, hopes \"this video was helpful.\" He promotes additional video tutorials and a video course that aims to transform the iPhone \"from a simple calling device to a video creation tool.\" He concludes by directing the listener to a link and thanking them for watching."

A male voice starts speaking in a casual tone, introducing himself and the topic of the video as he discusses the perceptions of software engineering. He notes that he, like others, has only talked about the positive aspects of being a software engineer, which can make the industry seem a bit unrealistic. He goes on to say that he feels people should have a deeper understanding of the realities of software developers instead of having expectations such as \"a six-figure salary and free coffee and snacks at work and being able to bring your dog to work.\" The voice continues, pointing out that those are major perks, but that there are also some not-so-healthy things. Finally, he poses a question as to what are some of the negative things that come along with being in the tech industry as a software engineer working for a competitive company."

He advises selecting uncommon keys, then recommends turning on global keys to allow the same hotkeys to affect the timer, regardless of which window is in focus. The speaker encourages resizing the window and then begins to explain the different colors of the split, such as blue for finishing a speedrun, as well as positive red, minus gold, and minus green indicators, describing their meaning. He apologizes for a \"stream inception\" before explaining they're going to import the LiveSplit window onto their OBS scene."

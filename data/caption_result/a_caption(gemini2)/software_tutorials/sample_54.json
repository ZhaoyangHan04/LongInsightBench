He then introduces his intent to show how to do that."

He recommends selecting a peak function, specifically a \"Gaussian function\", which then prompts a double-click to pick the peaks. He mentions opening the \"non-linear fit\", and proceeds to describe the parameters displayed. His instructions include clicking \"fit until converged\" to achieve a ready \"Gaussian fit\" with parameter values. Mentioning that the dialogue box shows the kind of function to fit the data, he transitions to discussing the FWHM obtained using the Gaussian fit, and instructs the listener to press \"done\" to generate a \"nice table\". The table shown contains statistical data, R-square values, and fitted points. All he needs is the plot right here. He then summarizes the equation of the Gaussian fit, the reduced Chi-square value, the adjusted R-squared, and all the parameters for the fit."

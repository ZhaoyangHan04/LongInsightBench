Following this introduction, a person begins creating a beat using vocal sounds, resembling a beatbox performance. The \"beat\" consists of a combination of rhythmic hums and percussive sounds. After this vocal-based beatboxing, the style changes to incorporate a musical track with an electronic or techno feel. The rhythmic \"Ooooh\" sound is layered into the existing beat, and a pulsing electronic bass line is added, completing the overall tone of the recording."

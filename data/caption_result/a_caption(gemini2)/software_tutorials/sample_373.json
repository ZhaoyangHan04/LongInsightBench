Smaller videos shown to a small, targeted audience have higher click-through rates. She describes this phenomenon as \"a paradox.\" She mentions that it isn't a problem because their discovery systems predict how likely a user is to click and watch a video, but she says it can make it hard for creators to interpret their video's performance and their title and thumbnails. She says that they recommend looking at a combination of your click-through rate and your impressions and that a new feature developed by \"Patricia\" will call that out for you. The tone is explanatory and clear, aimed at providing information."

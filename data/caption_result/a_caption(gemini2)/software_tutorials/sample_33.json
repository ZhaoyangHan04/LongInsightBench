He poses a question about how long the refrigerant cycle takes in a typical residential split system and then moves on to note the temperature and pressures of the system while describing what adjustments to make. There is some background ambience, which seems to be environmental sounds. He notes that one must dial in the sub cool to the manufacturer's recommendations and mentions that the goal is for the low side pressure to be around 40 to 42 degrees or 125 PSI and the high side temperature to be approximately 15 degrees above the outdoor temperature."

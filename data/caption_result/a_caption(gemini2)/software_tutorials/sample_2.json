She mentions that in some recent videos she showed how to put a young adult fantasy novel draft into an ebook format so it can be read on a Kindle. She adds that while chatting in the comments she got talking to another YouTuber, Fiction Technician, who said she likes to have Kindle read her books too so she can review them while she watches her kids at the park. The female speaker was shocked and asked her to teach her ways. She then thanks Jane for sharing these tips with her so she can share the steps with the viewers. She adds that in order to show how it works in the end, she is going to have Kindle read the first page of her novel, which she hasn't done publicly yet. Lastly, she says to stay tuned but that they should get into the steps. The audio clip ends with a reading of the first page of the novel with a female reading, â€œChapter One, Fire, I called again into the night.\""

She highlights the feature of choosing a voice to read a book and explains that this is the closest one can get to doing real auditions for a reader. The speaker describes how to find the voices, explaining that there are a bunch of different languages and accents to choose from. She particularly enjoys listening to British or Australian accents and details her experience of trying different accents with Kindle to see how they would sound with her book. The woman shares her choice of the Australian accent and clarifies there are different options for each accent, such as the \"normal\" version and an \"enhanced\" version, which she interprets as meaning the voice sounds smoother or more natural. A brief sample of two versions of a female voice saying \"Hello, my name is Karen\" is played to demonstrate the difference between the regular and \"enhanced\" options. The initial speaker returns and points out the download options available for additional voices."

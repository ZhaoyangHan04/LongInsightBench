The speaker mentions that the method will return a boolean value to confirm if the save was successful. Next, he mentions a separate method that will define a binary formatter, which will allow the speaker to define serialization surrogates for the formatter to use.

A short pause is followed by the speaker beginning to describe a method called load, discussing how to check if the path exists and open a file stream. He details attempting to open the file, returning the saved object if it works, and implementing error catching to prevent code failure, returning a null object as an alternative."

The speaker says it could be possible to extend this further to create surrogates for all of the properties of a monobehaviour to make it completely serializable.

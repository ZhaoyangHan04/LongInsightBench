He opines that soldering \"is the best way to connect wires\", disparaging the \"little automotive style connectors\" that some might default to.  He suggests that listeners who use such connectors \"go look at your trailer after a couple years being outside\". He continues, advocating that soldering is the \"ideal way\". He admits that soldering can be intimidating because some \"maybe you don't have the equipment\" or have had bad luck, but he claims that it's easy and states \"let's go into the kit right now\"."

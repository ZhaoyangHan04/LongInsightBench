The speaker elaborates on what seamless means with a neutral, instructional tone. The speaker points out the texture shown isn't seamless, and the speaker's tone suggests dissatisfaction. Later the speaker explains that they will replace the texture with a seamless texture to show the difference it can make. The male speaker lists the steps of importing textures and creating a new material in a neutral and informative tone. The male speaker describes the components of the material. The male speaker mentions the similarity of the material to the texture which isn't seamless, ending with the speaker explaining that using good seamless textures makes a difference."

He talks about putting it in a texture coordinate node, multiplying it by a constant value. He describes controlling the brightness of textures, adding 0.5 to the red channel and multiplying the results. He mentions adding it all into a comment named \"macro variation noise.\" He describes giving himself control over the contrast of the noise by creating a scalar parameter called \"noise contrast.\" He sets a default value to 0.5, plugs it into the A input of a lerp, leaving B set to 1. He plugs his macro variation noise into the alpha of the lerp and multiplies the result by everything already going into the base color. He plans to take a look at the result and compare it to previous work, noting the difference and planning to match the tint colors. He ends by explaining the effect of macro variation noise, especially when changing the noise contrast parameter."

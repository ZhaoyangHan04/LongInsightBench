This quickly fades out as a male speaker begins, stating that this will be a short section to discuss material objects and their energy. He speaks in an informative tone, providing informal definitions of energy as the ability of material to do work, which he further defines as the ability to push, pull, lift, or move other materials. The speaker reiterates his informal definition of material objects having abilities called energy."

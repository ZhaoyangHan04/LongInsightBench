The speaker uses a neutral, informative tone. The explanation then shifts to balancing more complex molecules before balancing free elements, suggesting to check the answer by summing atoms on each side, exemplified by the reaction of iron with oxygen. The speaker continues, stressing the importance of balancing reaction equations first in chemical reaction problems. The audio concludes with the same speaker discussing an ideal chemical reaction, where there are enough reactants to form all the products."

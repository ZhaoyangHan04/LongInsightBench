A second male voice responds, suggesting that high-boiling organic liquids undergo thermal decomposition at their boiling points, and proposes reducing the pressure of the distillation to lower the boiling point of the liquid, then concludes with \"vacuum distillation\". The first speaker agrees. \"Let's check on the stage hands\" is heard. Throughout the clip, consistent ambient background noise is present."

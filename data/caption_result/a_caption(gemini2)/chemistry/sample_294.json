This process, he details, relies on the lithiation of an epoxide and formation of an A complex with a boronate, which undergoes a Metason-type 1-2 rearrangement leading to a beta-alkoxyboronate, and eventually some type of elimination upon heating. He concludes by emphasizing the interesting aspect that the resulting alkene could be turned back into an epoxide for iterative application."

The final video focuses on how \"Bonic esters and similar elimination precursors\" are used in the procedure."

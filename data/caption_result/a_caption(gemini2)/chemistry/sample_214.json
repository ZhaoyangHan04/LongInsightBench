A male speaker then discusses chemical reactions, stating that \"most reactions are simple variations of the reflex apparatus.\" A female speaker, in a calm, instructional tone, explains the process of gradually adding reagents to a reaction mixture using a Claisen adapter. The woman mentions clamping the adapter and placing the condenser on the sidearm."

The speaker, a female, describes the process in a clear, instructional tone. She mentions adding a drying tube to the apparatus, using materials like anhydrous calcium sulfate or calcium chloride. She details how to prepare the drying tube with glass wool and drying agents. The narrator then talks about assembling a reflux apparatus and using a heat gun to drive out moisture, cautioning against adding water too soon to prevent damage. Finally, she notes cooling the apparatus to room temperature."

The speaker then instructs to connect the three-way stopcock to an inert gas cylinder and fill the balloon with the gas, ensuring no leaks. Next, the speaker says the stopcock with the balloon is inserted in a flask, which is then connected to a vacuum line. The speaker explains the apparatus is purged by opening and closing a stopcock connected to the vacuum line, and then filled with inert gas by opening the stopcock to the balloon."

She goes on to describe how the apparatus is assembled, the reaction conditions using low density, immiscible organic solvents, and how the solvent-water azeotrope vaporizes, condenses, and is collected in the trap. Finally, she concludes by talking about monitoring the progress of the reaction, whether it is by volume of water produced or the milkiness of the azeotrope."

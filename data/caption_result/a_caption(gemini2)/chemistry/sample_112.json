She states that the titration will determine the concentration of acetic acid in the vinegar, speaking in an instructional and clear tone. As she speaks, faint background sounds of what seems to be a laboratory environment can be heard. Before beginning, she indicates they will prime a burette."

She explains a process that involves stirring the solution, using a stir plate due to the lack of a lab partner, and adding five drops of phenolphthalein as an indicator solution. The speakerâ€™s tone suggests she is performing an experiment, followed by a statement of beginning titration. Throughout the clip, there's a consistent background hum of equipment, likely the stir plate used in the experiment."

The background features quiet liquid sounds, possibly caused by the burette and flask being used in the experiment."

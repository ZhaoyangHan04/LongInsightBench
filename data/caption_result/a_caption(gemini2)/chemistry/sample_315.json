He acknowledges the difficulty in measuring enthalpy directly and shifts focus to studying the change in enthalpy during chemical reactions, relating it to delta H values. He then references Dr. Tro's definition of the delta H of a reaction. The speaker recalls drawing energy diagrams earlier in the year, where an exothermic reaction involved a decrease in reactant energy as they transform into products, releasing energy. He restates this point, saying in an exothermic reaction, enthalpy decreases, with energy turning into heat and being released into the surroundings."

He speaks in a relatively neutral tone. He then contrasts this with endothermic processes where the delta H is increasing, specifying the absorption of 26.5 kilojoules of energy to make one mole of hydrogen iodide solid. He concludes that for the exothermic process the delta H is negative 890.3 kilojoules and for the endothermic process it's positive 26.5 kilojoules."

He then balances the equation and explains that this is an exothermic process, releasing a certain amount of energy when the balanced reaction occurs. He presents a combined statement summarizing the reaction and its enthalpy change. Finally, he poses a question about the energy released from a specific amount of ethanol burned with excess oxygen. The speaker then restates the original reaction that says one mole of ethanol will react with three moles of oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water."

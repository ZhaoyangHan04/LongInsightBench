    "audio_caption": "The clip begins with a female speaker introducing themselves as part of a group and outlining the topic of their presentation, which is \"electrolytic cell.\" She explains the concept of an electrolytic cell, describing it as a device that uses electrical energy to drive a non-spontaneous redox reaction, effectively converting electrical energy into chemical energy. She details that electrolytic cells consist of an electrolyte and two electrodes, clarifying the role of anode and cathode, including whether they undergo oxidation or reduction. Then she describes what is needed to make electrolysis work. Another female speaker takes over, introducing the next topic: the electrolysis process."

She explains that chloride ions are oxidized to form chlorine gas at the positive electrode, and references a Hoffman voltameter demonstration of hydrochloric acid electrolysis. Next, she suggests that \"this is one of the common questions in electrolysis process.\" Finally, she utters the phrase \"we're\" before the clip ends."

    "audio_caption": "The audio features a single female speaker with a clear and educational tone, discussing topics related to electrochemistry, such as salt bridges, decomposition potential, and overpotential. She explains how a salt bridge isn't used in a certain process due to the anode and cathode being in the same solution. The speaker delves into the concept of decomposition potential as the minimum electromotive force to bring about continuous discharge of ions. She continues by stating that the reverse reaction of reducing H+ by Cl is thermodynamically nonspontaneous, requiring more than 1.36 volts from an external power supply. She also explains how the overpotential is the difference between the theoretical cell voltage and the voltage needed to cause electrolysis, noting the impossibility of reversing a reaction due to side reactions."

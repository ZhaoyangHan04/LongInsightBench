He explains that in solids, atoms and molecules are locked in position due to strong attractions, and he mentions the example of a sodium chloride crystal. He describes that heating the solid allows breaking of attractions and the substance melts into a liquid. In liquids, the speaker says, the molecules can move around and overcome some attraction, but still stick together enough so that gravity pulls them down."

He demonstrates this with examples and emphasizes that while temperature numbers differ, temperature differences remain consistent between the two scales. The speaker suggests this will be crucial for future calculations in the course, concluding his instruction."

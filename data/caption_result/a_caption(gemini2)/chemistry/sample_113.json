    "audio_caption": "The clip starts with a person greeting \"everyone\" and introducing the topic of resonance structures in organic chemistry. The speaker continues to explain details, discussing pi and sigma bonds. It's a conversational and educational tone. The speaker clarifies about the hybrid orbitals and how they construct pi and sigma bonds. The speaker then speaks about the rule regarding carbon bonds, specifically single, double, or triple carbon bonds and how they effect sigma and pi bonds. The tone is instructional and the speaker seems to be in a learning or teaching context. The clip ends with the speaker wanting to delve into further detail."

A slightly exasperated tone follows, as she introduces an easier method: finding the typical valence electrons and comparing them. She concludes that if they aren't the same, there will be a formal charge."

    "audio_caption": "A female speaker presents information about the periodic table, specifically discussing oxygen and valence electrons in a clear, educational tone. Her explanation includes \"six valence electrons\" and mentions drawing out valence electrons, which results in a \"formal negative charge.\" She then describes the process of resonance structure, involving \"give the electron to the carbon atom\" and the need for an atom \"to lose one\" to accept another electron. This is spoken with a deliberate, teaching cadence. The discussion includes the swapping of formal charges and the drawing of molecules with two-headed arrows, mentioning that the effects of \"electrons pushing each other\" will be \"more when we get to mechanisms.\""

She quotes, \"Now, remember, now individual resonance structures do not exist,\" and continues to describe that what exists is a composite resonance structure with partial pi density distributing on the portion of the molecule with the formal negative charge. She then explains the reason for drawing it in the individual way. In the background, there's continuous bubbling sounds throughout the speech, creating the ambiance of a laboratory setting."

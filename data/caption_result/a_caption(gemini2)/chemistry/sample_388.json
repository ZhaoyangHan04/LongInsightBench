He explains that as elements get heavier, higher temperatures are needed, causing the star to expand and become a red giant. He further adds that the star's life only lasts about 130 million years, much less than the billions of years that hydrogen fusion lasted, as helium and other elements run out and form iron or nickel. The speaker also mentions that the result can be a very beautiful gas cloud, called a stellar nebula, with the star eventually becoming a white dwarf and the fusion reactions stopping. The speaker then states that elements as heavy as nickel can be formed by fusion reactions in a star like our sun."

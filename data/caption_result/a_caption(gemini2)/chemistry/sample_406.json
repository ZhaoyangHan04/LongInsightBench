He explains the law of multiple proportions and provides an example. A second law is explained, referring to \"the law of definite proportions,\" which describes how \"all samples of a pure chemical substance will always contain the same proportion of elements by mass.\" This speech is layered with calm and understated background music, featuring piano chords in an ambient style. The speaker continues to say that \"by mass, carbon dioxide is 73% oxygen and 27% carbon.\" He concludes that carbon dioxide is chemically the same in every location."

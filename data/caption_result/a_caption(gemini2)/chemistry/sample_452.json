He speaks in a clear, instructional tone, explaining that \"the rate would be dependent on the concentrations of the reactants\" and illustrating how to calculate the rate of reaction using K and concentrations. The speaker references a past video about measuring concentration in molarity and explains that the exponents have to be found experimentally. He mentions wanting to show how this works. Then, the sound of a cough briefly interrupts the speech."

Following this musical interlude, a man begins to speak in a conversational and informative tone, introducing a series of videos and alluding to an examination. He shifts the topic to spectroscopy, describing it as \"the study of how light and matter interact.\" The music fades back in softly to end the clip."

Then, he pivots to describe diffraction gratings, explaining their reflective material and series of closely spaced parallel ridges. He uses the analogy of light reflecting off of a CD or DVD to illustrate the rainbow effect. Finally, he reiterates that light in a spectrometer is separated into its component wavelengths after passing through the monochromator."

He says that they can \"select a wavelength of our choice\" by placing a card with a slit in the light's path to allow certain wavelengths to reach the sample while blocking others. He details how the light then passes through the sample to a detector, which reports the intensity of the light, and that they can select different wavelengths by adjusting a knob on the spectrometer. By repeating the adjustments for many wavelengths, they can generate a spectrum. The speaker uses a calm and informative tone throughout the explanation."

He describes a new experimental set up to facilitate this, including a sample chamber and heating coil to excite electrons in the sample, eventually emitting light. Just as in the second absorption spectrometer, emitted light passes through a monochromator and a slit to hit the detector."

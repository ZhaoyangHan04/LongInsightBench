    "audio_caption": "One male speaker begins by stating that something is not cost-effective, that he'd rather buy chromium powder and process it, or preferably buy particular salt. He mentions that he's already cooking some stainless steel tube in sulfuric acid with a little bit of hydrochloric acid, inside a beaker with a smaller beaker filled with water to condense the vapors, which he describes as a \"poor man's reflexing set up.\" Then he shares a backstory: he was about to machine this tube for his glass-blowing lathe and wondered what if he rubbed the outside walls of the tube with acid and sponge. He says \"yeah, and guess how that turned out. Exactly.\" He expected the tube to be quite corroded because of hydrochloric acid, and mentions kitchenware which claims to be stainless steel gets ruined by salty water in a few weeks. So, he thinks that the corrosion resistance of stainless steel to chlorine ions seems very low. He became curious what the chromium and nickel content of this steel is."

Next, the speaker states an \"RT tube is cooked\" and describes plans to transfer it, clarifying itâ€™s the leftover solution, not the tube itself. He adds that he's filtering it through a coffee filter, noting \"there was no insoluble residue.\" Lastly, he announces the next step is to precipitate the hydroxides of the metals."

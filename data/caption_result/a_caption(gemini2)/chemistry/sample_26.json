A male speaker enters, using a measured and slightly academic tone to describe alchemy as the science of the soul, explaining that it has material, ethereal, and immaterial aspects. He continues, in the same tone, and explains that no one can create essence from one substance because only God can make one from one, and that natural generation requires producing one thing from two. The music resumes, echoing the earlier mood, as the speaker finishes."

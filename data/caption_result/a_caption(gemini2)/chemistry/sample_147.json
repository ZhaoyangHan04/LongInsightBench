She highlights that properties of elements increase or decrease from left to right, and she draws attention to the two rows at the bottom of the table. She mentions that they are color-coded to match the sixth and seventh periods and asks why they sit out by themselves. She explains that this layout is due to the table being a long form periodic table. She notes that most periodic tables pull those two rows out due to size constraints, leaving the format that most are used to."

She acknowledges that \"the numbering gets funky there in the middle\", especially with three columns designated as 8B. She then points out the advantage of this Roman numeral system, noting that \"the A and B designations are really useful.\" She clarifies that everything in an A group can be called a \"main group or representative element\" and everything in a B group is \"a transition metal\"."

He believes hexamine may be \"quite exotic reagent\" in the US. He continues by describing having bought hexamine tablets, specifying that they are found in \"army shops or some survival stuff.\" The speaker expresses uncertainty about army shops being prevalent in the US. He admits to not doing proper research before the reaction and later discovering the presence of trioxane in the tablets."

There are some crystals in the condenser that they believe is hexamine, because the thing erupted initially. All speech is delivered by one speaker in a conversational and descriptive tone. Simultaneously, sounds resembling running water are audible, creating a sense of background ambience."

He then describes the separating the organic layer and adding water to neutralize hydrochloric acid, opting for calcium carbonate due to the unavailability of alternatives, albeit with a belief it would work.

He elaborates that litmus solution typically comes in blue or red. He proceeds to describe adding a blue litmus solution to an acid and observing that the color slowly changes to red, thus indicating acids turn blue litmus red. Next, he talks about adding red litmus solution to a base and observing the color changing to blue, conveying that bases turn red litmus blue. The speaker then concludes that litmus helps identify whether a solution is an acid or a base."

He then encourages the listener to pause and think about the question before he provides an answer. Continuing his explanation, he describes how acids and bases interact with litmus paper. To further illustrate the point, he references an experiment with lemons and litmus, demonstrating the color change of blue litmus when lemon juice is added and noting the lack of change when red litmus is exposed to lemon juice. He concludes by summarizing the concept of litmus color changes in contact with acids or bases."

She adds red litmus to the first container and then states that the color remains red, and is not changing. She switches to blue litmus and adds it to the second container, noting that the color remains the same there as well. The speaker continues, explaining that litmus does not change color when it comes into contact with a neutral solution, with red litmus remaining red, and blue litmus remaining blue. The speaker then summarizes that acids turn blue litmus red, and red litmus will remain red in their presence. She then makes a conclusion of the opposite of this, that bases turn red litmus blue, and blue litmus will remain blue. There will be no color change noticeable there."

The speaker emphasizes that the chemical reactions are the same for both the solution and litmus paper. The speaker proceeds to describe the color changes of both red and blue litmus paper when exposed to a base or acid respectively. Finally, the same male speaker offers a summary of the video, including remembering the color changes of litmus paper in acid and base using the acronyms B to B or BRB, encouraging the listener to rewind and review any forgotten information."

      "video_caption": "The video begins with a detailed presentation slide titled \"ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenges,\" showcasing two rows of images categorized under 'mammal' and 'vehicle' branches of ImageNet. The top row features various animals, while the bottom row displays different types of vehicles. The slide includes a caption explaining that each synset has 9 randomly sampled images. The scene transitions to a technical diagram illustrating the architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN), detailing layers such as convolutions, subsampling, and fully connected layers, with a focus on the input and output stages. Following this, a person wearing a dark gray t-shirt with the number \"84\" and a white \"L\" on the front is seen speaking into a microphone against a plain gray background, using hand gestures to emphasize points. The video then shifts to a simple flowchart diagram depicting an image classification process, where a sample image is input into an image classifier, which categorizes it into one of four classes: Dog, Cat, Squid, or Giraffe, with a question mark indicating uncertainty for the Squid category. The video concludes with the person continuing to speak, maintaining the same background and attire, with a focus on the educational content presented.",
      "audio_caption": "The clip begins with one male speaker talking about how \"deep learning and computer vision have come a long way\" since the ImageNet competition, and the \"core process remains the same\". He continues, discussing a \"fundamental flaw\" with the architectures and what to do if we \"don't have all images of every single category.\" As he finishes, there is a short, cartoonish \"boing\" sound effect."

Next, the speaker re-states the problem: \"We need to create an image classifier without having some samples of some object categories,\" giving an example about creating an animal classifier without enough giraffe samples. He then proposes, \"One way we could possibly do this is zero-shot learning,\" indicating learning from zero examples."

The diagram includes features such as 'Spotted,' 'Striped,' 'No. Legs,' 'Land_Creature,' 'Animal_type,' and 'Nose,' with numerical values assigned to each feature for both images. The person continues to speak and gesture, emphasizing points with their hands. The video then returns to the person in front of the microphone, with a split-screen showing the image classifier diagram and the person speaking. The diagram highlights the 'No. Limbs' feature with a red circle and arrow, indicating its importance in the classification process. The person continues to explain, using hand gestures to emphasize their points.

      "audio_caption": "The clip starts with a male speaker suggesting to input a description of an object instead of an image, and defining \"modalities.\" He then explains how to train the classifier and asks if that would solve their problem, before concluding it won't. He explains how they don't know which features to define, or what to call them, before moving on to propose an alternative solution. He proposes they could draw it instead. Another male speaker adds that this removes naming ambiguity and that a picture describes a thousand words."

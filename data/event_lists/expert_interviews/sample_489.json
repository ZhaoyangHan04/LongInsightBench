      "audio_caption": "The clip begins with a question regarding \"free software versus open source\" and a request to elaborate on the distinction. A male speaker responds by saying \"why do I say free software rather than open source\". He describes the difference between the terms and explains that the open source camp seeks to make companies and corporations more comfortable with free software. He continues saying, that \"open source is all about various compromises and trade-offs\" to appeal to corporate interests, which he feels is important for corporate investment, backing, and encouragement. He adds it has been \"enormously important to the growth of the free software and open source phenomenon\", naming \"IBM, HP, Intel, Sun and others\". To conclude, the man believes \"this is a healthy and natural part of the IT landscape,\" so he thinks that is good."

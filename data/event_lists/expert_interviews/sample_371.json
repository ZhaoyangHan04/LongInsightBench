The scene transitions to a drawing of a hospital bed with a patient and a healthcare worker, accompanied by the text 'MOST UNDER 70 Y OLD' in red, indicating that most COVID-19 patients are under 70 years old. Next, a healthcare worker in blue protective gear is shown testing a woman in a yellow shirt, with the text 'MUCH UNDER 100' in red, suggesting that most COVID-19 cases are under 100 years old. The video then highlights '10% LONG COVID' in green, with an arrow pointing to a group of people, including children, sitting together, indicating that 10% of COVID-19 patients experience long-term symptoms lasting over 12 weeks. The hand draws a thought bubble above the woman at the desk, containing a figure with a question mark, symbolizing confusion or concern. The video concludes with a red cross over a syringe and a virus, with the text 'VERSUS ELIMINAT' in green, implying a comparison between vaccination and elimination strategies. The overall theme of the video is to illustrate the impact of COVID-19 on different age groups and the prevalence of long-term symptoms.",
      "audio_caption": "The clip starts with a female speaker, sounding worried, who expresses concern over rhetoric about focusing on deaths. She points out that critical care admissions and cases are younger than 70 and that many people suffer from long COVID, which is not fully understood. She questions accepting deaths from a disease that could adapt and threaten vaccine response over elimination, emphasizing that it makes no sense to her, given many countries. A male voice briefly interrupts, questioning whether COVID can be eliminated."

      "video_caption": "In the video, two men are sitting outdoors in a park-like setting, surrounded by lush green trees and a clear sky, suggesting a pleasant day. The man on the left is wearing a black sleeveless shirt, revealing tattoos on his arms, while the man on the right is dressed in a white t-shirt. They appear to be engaged in a casual conversation, with the man on the left gesturing with his hands and occasionally looking towards the camera, indicating he might be speaking or explaining something. The man on the right listens attentively, occasionally smiling and nodding in agreement. The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly, with both individuals enjoying each other's company in a serene outdoor environment.",
      "audio_caption": "The audio begins with a short, mumbled remark. A male speaker comments on face tracking, suggesting it's on. Another male speaker says \"stupid gimbal\", then says, \"Alright, let's do it anyway.\" Another male speaker says, \"Alright, I don't know which one to look at now,\" with another response from the first speaker, then the speaker addresses the audience saying, \"What's up, guys? I just finished at Belem.\""

He provides a historical context of Hadoop architecture, mentioning that before Hadoop 2, the name node was a single point of failure, with no automatic failover mechanism. Then he describes how the concept of two name nodes was brought in, one active and one passive, as a standby, and that it will take over in failover scenarios. He also introduces the concept of general nodes for maintaining a quorum and sharing namespace and metadata information between the two name nodes, active and passive."

The slide is divided into two sections: on the left, there is a textual explanation of the issue, and on the right, a diagram illustrating the HDFS NameNode HA architecture. The text explains that in a typical HA cluster, two separate machines are configured as NameNodes, with one in an Active state and the other in a Standby state. The Active NameNode handles all client operations, while the Standby NameNode maintains enough state to provide a fast failover if necessary. The diagram shows the components of the HDFS NameNode HA architecture, including the Active and Standby NameNodes, Quorum Journal Nodes, and DataNodes, along with their interactions and data flow. The slide also highlights the importance of the Standby node having up-to-date information regarding the location of blocks in the cluster to ensure a fast failover. The background of the slide is a gradient of blue shades, and there is a small image of a person in the bottom right corner, likely the presenter.

      "audio_caption": "A man begins speaking in a conversational tone, explaining that dementia is a health problem that severely affects memory and thinking, and that Alzheimer's is the most common cause. He continues, mentioning that in North America, the people typically impacted by Alzheimer's and dementia are those over the age of 65. He states that it is a disorder uncommon under 65, but affects one in two or one in three people over the age of 85.  He then says that dementia is on the rise and that it's a problem because the population is aging, and that the prevalence of dementia is rising in lockstep with the aging of the population. He concludes his explanation by agreeing to explain \"non-traditional factors.\""

He finishes by stating they're trying to communicate two messages: to pay attention to aberrant repair response and to how small things add up.

He shares that they looked at high blood pressure, cholesterol, and other things as risks, and they helped to establish the current understanding. He explains that they started over and threw out everything they knew, and used things that couldn’t possibly be related to the risk of Alzheimer's to draw attention that there must be something else going on. A man then asks him how many people were involved and how long it took. The speaker replied, \"So, this was a mountain of work.\" Then, a different man said you know you’re onto something big when you do a ton of media.

It then transitions to a black background featuring two sets of three-dimensional coordinate axes, one in blue and the other in red, each labeled with Greek letters (x, y, z for blue and ξ, η, ζ for red). These axes are positioned to represent different reference frames, likely illustrating the concept of relative motion in the context of the twin paradox. The video concludes with a single set of axes, combining both blue and red lines, symbolizing the merging of the two reference frames into a unified perspective. Throughout the video, the focus remains on the graphical representation of the coordinate systems, emphasizing the mathematical and theoretical aspects of the twin paradox without any human presence or environmental details.",

She then provides mathematical equations related to the angle between a force and resultant, and when that angle is at it's maximum, she says tan phi becomes mu s, and \"this is called the angle of static friction.\" A crashing or clattering sound interrupts, which seems unintentional and possibly caused by objects falling over.

The slide features a diagram with arrows indicating the direction of movement and the corresponding weight changes. The text on the slide reads, \"Take a heavy object in your palm and move it up and down; notice how the object's weight changes.\" The diagram illustrates four scenarios: \"Rising & Slowing Down: Lose Weight,\" \"Falling & Speeding Up: Lose Weight,\" \"Rising & Speeding Up: Gain Weight,\" and \"Falling & Slowing Down: Gain Weight.\" Each scenario is accompanied by an arrow pointing in the direction of movement, with the words \"With gravity\" or \"Against gravity\" to indicate the force acting on the object. Additionally, there is an image of a hand holding a dumbbell, demonstrating the concept visually. The background of the slide is white, and the text is in black and blue, with the title \"Weight Gain and Loss\" in blue at the top.

The slide then transitions to a diagram of the Gold Foil Experiment, suggesting that it was conducted by Ernest Rutherford in 1911 by Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden. The experiment involved shooting alpha particles at a gold foil, with the aim of probing the structure of the atom. The slide explains that if the atom were a solid mass, few alpha particles would get through, but if negative electrons were embedded in a thin positive mass, all would get through. However, most alpha particles passed through with some being scattered by the small positive nucleus. The final slide illustrates Rutherford's proposal that the atom is mostly empty space, with a central nucleus surrounded by electrons. The background of the slides is a light blue color, and the text is presented in a clear, easy-to-read font.

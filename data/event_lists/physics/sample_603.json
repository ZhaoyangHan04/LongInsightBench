      "video_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a blue circular object on a dark surface. A hand with a gold ring enters the frame, pressing down on the object, which appears to be a button or a stamp. The hand then uses a hammer to strike the object, causing it to deform slightly. The hand reappears, pressing down on the object again, and then uses a stamp with a brass-colored handle to imprint a design onto the object. The design, which includes the letters \"CBA,\" is visible on the object's surface. The hand then points to the imprinted design, indicating its presence. The video concludes with the hand pressing down on the object once more, emphasizing the imprinted design. Throughout the video, the background remains a consistent dark surface, and the focus is on the interaction between the hand and the blue object.",
      "audio_caption": "The clip begins with the sound of a rubbery impact, followed by a male speaker describing the properties of viscoelastic silicone rubber, noting its stiffness and resilience when struck quickly versus its softness when pressed slowly.

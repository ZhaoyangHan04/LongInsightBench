      "video_caption": "The video is an educational tutorial by Blueprint Education on converting a galvanometer into a voltmeter. It begins with a title screen displaying the Blueprint Education logo and the objective of the tutorial: \"TO CONVERT THE GIVEN GALVANOMETER INTO A VOLTMETER OF A DESIRED RANGE AND VERIFY THE SAME.\" The tutorial is divided into steps, starting with the procedure for conversion. The first step involves noting the total number of divisions on either side of the zero of the galvanometer. The second step shows a close-up of a galvanometer with a needle pointing to a specific division, emphasizing the importance of this measurement. The third step introduces the calculation of the current \\( I_g \\) using the relation \\( I_g = nK \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of divisions and \\( K \\) is the current per division. The fourth step explains the calculation of the resistance \\( R \\) using the formula \\( R = \\frac{V}{I_g} - G \\), where \\( V \\) is the desired voltage range, \\( I_g \\) is the full-scale deflection current, and \\( G \\) is the galvanometer's internal resistance. The fifth step involves connecting a resistance box in series with the galvanometer and adjusting the resistance to achieve the desired voltage range. The video concludes with a demonstration of the completed conversion, showing the galvanometer with the resistance box connected, now functioning as a voltmeter. Throughout the video, the background is a consistent orange color, and the Blueprint Education logo is visible in the top left corner.

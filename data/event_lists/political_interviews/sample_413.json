      "audio_caption": "The audio starts with a male speaker reflecting on something being \"more a campaign\" than a proper search and rescue effort. He notes the involvement of young people from Berlin in welcoming moments in 2015 in Germany. He says that the goal was \"to be recognized\" and force the state to take over again and launch another \"Mare nostrum\" kind of mission. He says that it \"was not happening\" so \"they had the ship\" and asked around for people to join the crew. Another male speaker adds that there have been 15 other missions so it was 16 total missions in one year, and then in August 2017 the Iuventa was seized. He explains it was in operation for one year, but that they managed to save over 14,000 lives, and that it is amazing because every person who does not die is \"a reason to go out and do this work.\"  A female voice then says something indiscernible."

      "audio_caption": "The audio clip begins with a conversational exchange between two speakers. One speaker, a female, inquires about the evolution of rescue operations at sea during the Juventus experience. A male speaker responds, stating that while the rescue mission itself hasn't changed much in terms of technique and crew size, the behavior of the European, specifically the Italian state, has evolved in their efforts to suppress these rescue operations. He says they have developed new tools to stop civil sea rescue. He then expresses the horror of people dying at sea, compounded by the frustration of sitting through trials in court. Another male speaker joins in, indicating there are two major changes. A musical element with an unknown genre follows, along with ongoing speech."

A child-like voice pipes up, \"Yes Rohit bhaiya, there are many dried leaves here. And pebbles too,\" suggesting they can create something beautiful. The male voice then suggests, \"So let's first collect these things\".  Sounds of light rustling and movement become audible, implying a garden setting and the collection of materials.

A child-like voice, presumably male, speaks up saying \"when dad makes tea he filters the tea leaves,\" suggesting this is a method of separation. A young-sounding, feminine voice speaks up, agreeing this \"too\" is a method, the only difference being that \"one of the substance is liquid and the other one is solid.\" The narrator comes back on, confirming \"Sabina is right\" and describes the \"process is called sieving.\" He then asks for other examples. A young male voice states \"separate the impurities from the flour by sieving before making the chapati.\" A male voice, possibly older, describes seeing a \"large sieve at the construction site\" to \"separate the pebbles from the sand.\" The narrator responds, \"very good\", then explains \"separation of substances is done by many such processes\", before asking what \"other processes\" there are. He then presents, \"Threshing and sedimentation are also used to separate substances\" as examples before the audio ends."

All of this is very interesting!” A young male speaker summarizes the fun of the class and how they learned about separation processes."

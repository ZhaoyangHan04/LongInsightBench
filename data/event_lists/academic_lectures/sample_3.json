The person is seen placing the vial on a white surface with several transparent strips laid out in a row. The person then uses a thin stick to transfer the red liquid from the vial onto one of the strips, creating a small red line. The person continues to apply the liquid to the strip, ensuring an even distribution. The background remains consistent throughout, with the white surface and transparent strips being the main focus. The video concludes with the person holding the vial and the stick, having completed the application of the red liquid onto the strip.",
      "audio_caption": "A female speaker begins by stating, \"The funnest part of uh, your CBC is making blood smears.\" She then mentions it's usually the bane of people's existence, but the aim is to avoid problems. The speaker continues, indicating the need for a well-mixed, unclotted EDTA tube, with gentle mixing being preferred. She adds that if there's concern about clots, an applicator stick can be used, which will reveal any clots present in the sample. If the stick comes out clean, the sample is good."

The individual uses a thin red stick to place a small drop of red liquid onto each slide. After placing the drops, the person uses a white tool to spread the liquid evenly across the slides. The person's hands are the main focus of the video, with the background remaining plain and unobtrusive. The video demonstrates a precise and careful process of preparing the slides with the red liquid.",
      "audio_caption": "A female speaker starts by introducing appropriately-sized drops, recommending a 45-degree spreader angle, which may need alteration based on patient PCV. The speaker gives instructions: \"You want to anchor your side with your index finger...\" adding to not place the arm or a finger in the middle, because that creates pressure. Then, the speaker suggests holding it on either side, and pushes out the blood. Lastly, the speaker provides advice to use the bottom slide as a spreader with the index finger, suggesting it will provide good slide preparations and mentioning a thumbnail shape."

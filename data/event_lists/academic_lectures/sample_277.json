      "video_caption": "The video begins in a hospital corridor, where a man in blue scrubs walks towards the camera, talking on the phone. The corridor is brightly lit with white walls, wooden handrails, and a colorful tiled floor. As he approaches, he stops and leans forward, continuing his conversation. The scene transitions to a close-up of a medical procedure involving a kidney, shown through an X-ray image. The next frame shows a person in medical attire, including a black vest and a surgical cap, standing against a white background. The video then shifts to an outdoor setting, where a man in a black jacket and blue jeans walks down a staircase at the 20 St-Le Lexington Av subway station, with signs indicating the station's name and directions. The final scene returns to a clinical environment, where a person in green scrubs prepares a syringe and a dropper, likely for a medical procedure, with a bottle of hand sanitizer visible on the table. The video captures a blend of medical and everyday life, highlighting the contrast between the sterile hospital environment and the bustling urban setting.",
      "audio_caption": "The clip starts with a male speaker adopting a playful tone, posing a question, \"So you want to know how to read a chess hex ray, do ya?\".

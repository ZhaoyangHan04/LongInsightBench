It transitions to a black-and-white animated classroom scene where a teacher, dressed in a suit and bow tie, stands at the front, pointing and speaking to a student with curly hair who sits with arms crossed, looking skeptical. The classroom is filled with other students, all appearing confused, as indicated by question marks above their heads. The teacher writes the numbers \"1 2 3 4\" on the board, which are then crossed out, followed by the addition of three dots. The teacher then draws an eye on the board, with the students' confusion persisting. The video maintains a simple, cartoonish style throughout, emphasizing the teacher's lesson and the students' reactions.",

The video continues with the girl holding the two parts of the picture, while a bear and a cat look on. The girl is then seen throwing the orange faces into a trash can, with a smiling cloud character holding a box of crayons in the background. The video concludes with the girl sitting on the floor, holding a book titled \"STICKY BOO,\" while the bear and cat look on. The overall atmosphere is playful and educational, with the girl engaging in a creative activity involving the picture and the animals.",
      "audio_caption": "A male speaker explains that at age 5, most kids didn’t practice math enough to break apart \"hierarchical relationships\" while still remembering the whole. He then explains that once a child cuts a whole into parts, the whole no longer exists for them at that moment because they haven’t constructed the concept of the whole as a sum of its parts. He further illustrates by explaining that when they divide animals into cats and dogs, they can only think of two parts, and the idea of the whole is forgotten. Thinking about all animals requires dividing the whole and then putting it back together. This mental process is something most five-year-old children can't do."

      "video_caption": "The video begins with a series of educational posters addressing common misconceptions about HIV/AIDS, such as the belief that one can catch AIDS from a glass or a toilet seat. These posters aim to dispel myths and provide factual information. The scene then transitions to a protest where individuals hold signs advocating for the cessation of profit-making from people's lives and highlighting the daily deaths caused by AIDS. The video then revisits the educational posters, emphasizing the importance of understanding and combating misinformation about HIV/AIDS. Following this, a timeline of the AIDS epidemic from 1981 to 1995 is presented, detailing significant events and milestones in the fight against the disease. The video concludes with a scientific illustration comparing the genetic structure of HIV-1 to that of other retroviruses, such as EIAV, FIV/BIV/OMWC, and HIV-2, alongside images of animals that are hosts to these viruses. This segment underscores the evolutionary relationships and genetic similarities between HIV and other retroviruses, providing a deeper understanding of the virus's origins and characteristics.",
      "audio_caption": "The audio starts with a narration about the origins of HIV, recalling its emergence in the 1980s and noting the progress made in understanding its source through 25 years of research. The speaker sounds informative. The discussion of HIV's classification as a lenti-virus transitions to technical language. The speaker discusses genome and life cycle."

The diagram highlights the genes and their functions, with labels like 'pol', 'tat', 'rev', and 'env'. A person wearing a black shirt and a VR headset is shown working in a laboratory setting, surrounded by scientific equipment. The scene transitions to a phylogenetic tree diagram, illustrating the evolutionary relationships among different primate species, including a cougar, a monkey, and a vervet monkey. The tree is color-coded and labeled with various species names, such as 'HIV-1', 'SIVagm', and 'SIVmac', indicating their genetic connections. The video then focuses on a Rhesus macaque, an Asian monkey, with text explaining that 'SIVagm' is associated with Simian AIDS. The narrative continues with a close-up of a vervet monkey, labeled 'Vervet (African Green Monkey)', and text indicating 'SIVmac = Simian AIDS'. The video concludes with a bar graph titled 'Estimated Number of AIDS-Related Deaths Worldwide, 1980-2000', showing a significant increase in deaths over the years, sourced from UNAIDS. The graph illustrates the impact of the AIDS epidemic on a global scale, emphasizing the severity and progression of the disease over two decades.",
      "audio_caption": "The audio clip begins with a single speaker, who sounds like a male speaking in an informative tone, discussing lentiviruses and their effects on immune cells, referencing different animals they can infect. He then mentions how the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus affects African green monkeys. The speaker also talks about if a monkey from Asia is infected with the HIV from the African monkey or vice versa, resulting in a condition paralleling what we see in humans. Lastly, the speaker asks the question of where HIV came from."

The scene then transitions to a photograph of two individuals standing beside a chimpanzee, with a caption explaining that bushmeat is a cultural practice in certain locales. A bar graph titled \"The Bushmeat Death Toll\" follows, showing the average annual number of large animals killed per square kilometer of forest in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa, with Africa having the highest toll. The video then shifts to a map of Central Africa, illustrating the spread of the virus from humans butchering chimpanzees infected with SIV in Equatorial Guinea to Kinshasa, where the epidemic begins. The map includes numbered points and a dotted line indicating the virus's travel route along the river. The final frame reiterates the map and its explanation, emphasizing the virus's journey from the initial infection site to the epicenter of the epidemic in Kinshasa.",
      "audio_caption": "The audio clip features a single male speaker in an informative tone discussing the transmission of a disease from primates to humans. He mentions hunters trapping, butchering, and eating chimps, and the practice of hunting primates for \"bush meat.\" He then says that there is a strong suggestion of where to look, African monkeys, and that evidence suggests a region in Western Equatorial Africa where chimpanzees were found with a relative of the ancestral strain of HIV."

A map of Africa labeled 'Colonialism (1914)' shows land occupation, with text suggesting that the spread of HIV was more influenced by colonialism and industrialization than African culture. The video then presents a map of Africa with population density, discussing previous zoonotic transfers of HIV and the role of injectable drugs, prostitution, and urbanization in its spread. The final frames depict a map of the Caribbean and North America, with text explaining the potential spread of HIV to Haiti, the US, or Europe via sailors on cargo ships, concluding the narrative on the global transmission of HIV.",
      "audio_caption": "A single male speaker with a measured, informative tone discusses the population boom in Equatorial African cities post-World War II, the disruption of traditional lifestyles, and the possible increase in prostitution and drug use. He suggests that colonialism and industrialization, rather than African culture, led to the spread of HIV, particularly due to frequent contact with primates. The speaker references zoonotic transfers of HIV from prey to hunter, drug use, urbanization, and potential spread to Haiti, the US, and Europe."

The scene transitions to a man in a black blazer and a graphic t-shirt standing in front of a bookshelf filled with books and a framed map on the wall, speaking to the camera. The man continues to speak, and a webpage from Airforce Technology appears on the screen, discussing Northrop's production of a new AN/APG-85 AESA radar for F-35 jets. The man gestures while speaking, and the text 'PESA/AESA hybrids' appears on the screen. The video then shows a fighter jet in flight against a clear blue sky, followed by a close-up of the jet's cockpit canopy. The jet is then seen on an aircraft carrier deck, with its canopy open, and the video concludes with the jet taxiing on the deck.",
      "audio_caption": "The audio clip begins with a serious male voice announcing that Mister Millennium 7 is malfunctioning, and therefore they will take over the channel to discuss AESA radars. He adds that due to M7's \"very human attitude toward technology\", the speaker will address several issues that plague AESA radars. This is followed by a cheerful male voice interjecting that he is still here. The audio transitions to music in an electronic style, which then fades out as the cheerful male voice begins discussing the recent video on AESA radars inspired by news of the F-35 getting a new radar. He discusses how AESA technology has made everything else obsolete but then introduces the idea that the technology is not fully mature, so he wishes to point out the problems. He concludes by stating they will take a journey to understand the drawbacks and don'ts of the technology, with some of the material not covered on YouTube. Abruptly, sounds of static and a high-pitched noise like a jet engine abruptly drown out the speech. Then the cheerful male voice repeats the question \"So, what is an AESA radar?\"."

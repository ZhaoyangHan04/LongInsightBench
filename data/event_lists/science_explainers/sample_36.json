      "video_caption": "The video begins with a man in a white lab coat and dark blue shirt standing in a modern kitchen, gesturing as he speaks. The kitchen features white cabinets, a vase with sunflowers, and a window letting in natural light. The scene then transitions to an animated setting where a character with blue hair and a white lab coat stands in front of shelves filled with various items, including a box labeled 'TIME TRAVEL STUFF.' Another character, wearing a green shirt with brown stripes, appears surprised or concerned, while a third character with brown hair is partially visible. The video alternates between the live-action man in the kitchen and the animated characters, suggesting a connection between the two scenes. The live-action man continues to speak and gesture, while the animated characters engage in a conversation, with the background of the animated scene featuring a cluttered room with shelves and various objects.",
      "audio_caption": "The audio clip begins with a male speaker introducing himself and reminiscing about a time when Pluto was reclassified as a planet. He speaks in a conversational tone, imitating pseudo-intellectuals pointing out this fact. A different male voice, speaking sternly, insists Pluto is not a planet, telling someone to \"shut up.\" Immediately following this exchange, there is an abrupt silence."

He gestures with his hands as he speaks, and an image of a planet appears on the screen, indicating a discussion about space or astronomy. The scene transitions to a close-up of a rocky surface, possibly a celestial body, followed by a view of a large radio telescope in a remote area, suggesting a connection to scientific research or exploration. The video then shifts to a person playing a keyboard, with their hands visible on the keys, indicating a musical element. Throughout the video, the man in the lab coat continues to speak, maintaining a professional and informative atmosphere.",
      "audio_caption": "The audio clip begins with a male speaker reminiscing about the redesign of toys, posters, and textbooks due to Pluto's reclassification. He humorously notes that this happened while a spaceship was on its way to Pluto. He then states that he is there to explain why the International Astronomical Union's decision is contentious among people with an emotional attachment to Pluto, and within the scientific community as well. A brief humorous male voice states that Pluto was a planet until a committee disagreed, and then he disagrees back. This is followed by a male speaker introducing himself and his show. The audio then transitions to a retro electronic instrumental piece, reminiscent of a video game soundtrack, that continues throughout the clip."

The person continues to speak, and the image of the dwarf planets remains visible. The scene transitions to a poster titled 'MOONS OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM,' displaying various moons with their names and images. The person continues to speak, gesturing with their hands. The video then shows a list of articles related to dwarf planets, with titles such as 'Geologically Diverse Pluto and Charon, Implications for the Dwarf Planets of the Kuiper Belt' and 'Ozone chemistry on tidally locked M dwarf planets.' The person continues to speak, and the list of articles remains on the screen. The video concludes with the person still speaking in the same kitchen setting, with the list of articles still visible.",
      "audio_caption": "A man begins speaking in a matter-of-fact tone, describing a hypothetical scenario of a scientist searching for phosphine. He suggests that searching for \"planets as defined by the IAU\" would exclude \"interesting moons\" and other \"really interesting places.\" He argues that the definition of \"dwarf planet\" doesn't aid scientific inquiry. He continues, noting that a Google Scholar search for \"dwarf planets\" mainly yields papers about \"M dwarf stars,\" indicating that scientists don't commonly use \"dwarf planet\" for study categorization. Simultaneously with the speech, a brief, rhythmic musical interlude of a simple, quirky tune plays, with a synthesizer and some electronic elements giving it a playful, slightly futuristic mood."

The scene transitions to a black screen with white text detailing the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) definition of a planet in 2006, highlighting key criteria such as orbiting the Sun, sufficient mass for a nearly round shape, and clearing its orbital neighborhood. Following this, a table appears, listing assumptions and costs for different scenarios, including \"Without Forum Hall,\" \"With Forum Hall,\" and \"Farewell Dinner,\" with figures in Czech Koruna (CZK) and Euros (EUR). The video then shows results of IAU resolutions, including votes for \"Definition of Planet,\" \"Definition of Classical Planet,\" and \"Definition of Pluto-class objects,\" with specific vote counts and percentages. The man reappears in the kitchen, continuing his explanation. The video concludes with a black screen displaying text about controversy surrounding closed-door meetings and the IAU membership, emphasizing the lack of planetary scientists among its members.",
      "audio_caption": "The clip begins with speech. A male speaker expresses his opinion that the vote that demoted Pluto was \"weird\", then describes the resolution and requirements for being a planet. He remarks the vote was far from a scientific consensus and was left to those with the time to consider the motions. The speech fades to instrumental music, sounding electronic and futuristic in tone."

He presents the hypothetical situation of Earth being kicked out of the solar system, noting that it would then not be classified as a planet anymore, even though it is one. He concludes that including this in the definition is \"a weird thing\"."

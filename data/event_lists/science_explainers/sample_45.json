      "audio_caption": "The audio begins with a calm and informative male voice explaining the cosmological principle and how it should appear consistent regardless of location or direction. He acknowledges that this may seem untrue due to the varying stars, planets, and galaxies we observe. He mentions that it's expected to be true above a very large length scale, because the universe was very small right after the Big Bang. He further explains that during this time, quantum fluctuations created non-uniformities, which were stretched into galaxies and clusters during a period of inflation. The voice becomes slightly more inquisitive while discussing how the Great GRB Wall contradicts the cosmological principle, but then states that the idea is not the end of the story. The voice continues by noting the likelihood of quantum fluctuations, and explains how the Great GRB Wall remains an open question in terms of the principle and theories of inflation. The voice concludes with, \"For now, the largest structure in the universe may just be its greatest mystery.\" Finally, the sound transitions to a short musical stinger that emphasizes suspense."

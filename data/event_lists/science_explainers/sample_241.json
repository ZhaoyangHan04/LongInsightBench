A diagram follows, depicting the interaction between 'MPs' (likely referring to 'Mast Cells') and 'DC' (Dendritic Cells), with arrows indicating the flow of information or substances. The process continues with the interaction between 'DC' and 'T cell' (T lymphocytes), highlighting the immune response. The video then shifts to a cross-sectional view of skin layers, with red lines representing radiofrequency waves penetrating the tissue, emphasizing the treatment's mechanism. The text 'YES!! RF CAN DESTROY FACIAL FAT CELLS' appears in bold pink letters, affirming the effectiveness of radiofrequency in fat reduction. The final frames show a background of red blood cells with a thermometer graphic, indicating the temperature range for fat cell damage (41°C - 105.8°F), reinforcing the scientific basis of the treatment.

The speaker poses the question, \"will radio frequency destroy facial fat then?\" before answering that it absolutely has the potential to destroy fat cells. Professional machines will heat the epidermis and hypodermis to a much higher temperature than at-home machines. Gentle and soothing music plays softly in the background throughout the speech."

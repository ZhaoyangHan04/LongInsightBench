      "audio_caption": "The audio clip starts with a female narrator introducing the common perceptions around psychopaths and their behavior, often influenced by media like \"Silence of the Lambs,\" \"The Dark Knight,\" and \"Psycho.\" The narrator suggests that when people imagine a psychopath, they might picture an \"archetypical villain\" depicted in films, possibly \"a nonchalant man with expensive taste\" and \"a taste for gratuitous violence.\" The narration transitions to discussing how some behaviors shown in films are inaccurate but others are supported by research. The narrator questions the origins of these associations and whether they hold any truth. The narration is layered over gentle, classical background music that maintains a steady pace throughout."

      "audio_caption": "The audio clip begins with a female speaker discussing how most people can identify their sleep chronotype, specifically mentioning early birds and night owls. She then discusses how this preference could indicate \"psychopathy\" or antisocial personality disorders based on a study by Dr. Peter Jonason, who assessed morning and evening people for \"dark triad\" traits. The speaker maintains a neutral and informative tone throughout this portion. She continues to detail Jonason's findings, stating that night owls showed greater antisocial tendencies, suggesting an evolutionary basis. Finally, the speaker concludes by implying that someone's sleep chronotype could offer insight into whether they are \"psychopathic or not.\" A brief yawn sound effect follows after she says the number \"three.\""

She mentions the study looked at how narcissistic and self-objectifying these men were and how it relates to how many selfies they posted, especially if they edited them. The speaker states these men who posted more selfies also scored higher on levels of psychopathy, and ends by suggesting that frequent selfie posting could be a sign of higher levels of antisocial traits like narcissism and psychopathy. Following the description of the study, the speaker lowers her tone and adds a single word: \"and lastly, sense of smell.\" Background music, which sounds soft and melodic, plays throughout the entire clip."

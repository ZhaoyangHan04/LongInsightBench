      "audio_caption": "The audio clip begins with a single male speaker arguing that the Bible states the earth is fixed. He then reads from a bible verse, asserting that \"the world also is established, that it cannot be moved.\" The same speaker then refers to an individual making a list and claims Biblical scholars believed in a fixed Earth. Following this, he asks if the former individual is simply \"one man crying in the wilderness.\" He then remarks that there appear to be two individuals now. He concludes the first section by claiming belief in geocentric worlds is held by many creationists. A quick cut ensues, with the same male speaker remarking on a second person who believes they can prove this with physics."

      "video_caption": "The video begins with a white screen displaying the words \"Common Sense\" in blue text, setting the theme for the content that follows. It then transitions to an image of a character in a red and black costume, with a speech bubble that reads \"Durr, my common sense is failing.\" Below the image, the text \"Common Sense\" is reiterated, followed by the phrase \"So rare that it's a super power,\" emphasizing the rarity and value of common sense. The next scene shows a warehouse with forklifts and workers, accompanied by the text \"COMMON SENSE\" and the phrase \"Just because you can, doesn't mean you should,\" highlighting the importance of using common sense in decision-making. The video then shifts to a man in a beige shirt standing behind a podium with a laptop, suggesting a presentation or lecture setting. The final scene features a man in a suit standing in front of a chalkboard filled with mathematical equations, with the text \"I have no doubt that in reality the future will be vastly more surprising than anything I can imagine. Now my own suspicion is that the Universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose,\" indicating a discussion on the unpredictability of the future and the complexity of the universe. The video uses these visual elements and text to convey the significance of common sense in various contexts.",
      "audio_caption": "The audio clip begins with a male speaker discussing the limited usefulness of common sense in science, characterizing it as intuition and life experiences confined to familiar scales. A quote is provided from a TED talk to demonstrate that the universe is \"queerer than we can suppose,\" highlighting the limited human imagination.

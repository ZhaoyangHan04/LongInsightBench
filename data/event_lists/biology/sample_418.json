      "audio_caption": "A female speaker begins by describing how she is cutting along the probe to open up the right atrium. She notes that it's a small chamber, essentially an entrance into the heart for blood entering the right side. She proceeds to cut down along the edge of a wrinkle toward the apex to open up the right ventricle, explaining she will turn the heart upside down to do so. During this speech, her tone is instructional and deliberate. As she describes the apex, she reminds the audience that the right side of the heart does not include it, as it is part of the left ventricle."

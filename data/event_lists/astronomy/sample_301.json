The Earth is depicted at four key positions in its orbit, each labeled with the date of the solstice or equinox and the season it represents. The Northern Hemisphere experiences summer from June 20/21, autumn from September 22/23, winter from December 21/22, and spring from March 20. Conversely, the Southern Hemisphere experiences the opposite seasons. The diagram uses a red elliptical path to show the Earth's orbit, with arrows indicating the direction of movement. The background is a starry space scene, emphasizing the cosmic context. The text \"Season in Northern Hemisphere\" and \"Season in Southern Hemisphere\" is displayed at the bottom, clarifying the seasonal differences between the two hemispheres. The visual remains consistent throughout the video, with no changes or movements between frames.",
      "audio_caption": "A male speaker explains that in December, the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun while the southern hemisphere is tilted towards it. He explains that this is why the northern hemisphere has winter and the southern hemisphere has summer. He continues that the opposite is true in June. The speaker clarifies that the tilt stays the same, but the earth's position in its orbit around the sun causes the difference. He adds that the rotational axis still points in the same direction in both summer and winter. The clip ends with the male speaker sighing."

He continues, mentioning that the Earth's orbit around the sun causes a difference between a solar day and a sidereal day, which he then defines as Earth's rotation relative to the stars. He further explains that looking at the sky and seeing certain stars at a position, shows the same position the next day after 23 hours and 56 minutes, and due to that difference, every day has roughly 4 minutes of difference over 365 days, adding up to an additional rotation. He finishes by thanking the listener for watching and saying goodbye."

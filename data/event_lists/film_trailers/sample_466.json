The male then pauses, after which the audio pivots abruptly, where a new male speaker with an informative and educational tone introduces himself as Andy, a gaffer, and proposes exploring lighting techniques for film scenes.

A male voice acknowledges with \"Thanks Gilda\", followed by the same woman clarifying, \"Three fingerings\". The woman questions if the orderer is \"a two-fingers kind of guy\", before being cut off by the male speaker who explains that using too many lights \"causes the scene to lose any sense of mood\". The woman questions \"Another day you're trying to forget?\" A male voice responds, \"Another day I got to remind myself not to repeat.\" The first male speaker continues, discussing the lighting being too intense, then proposes \"Let's take a look at this lighting setup and see what we can improve.\""

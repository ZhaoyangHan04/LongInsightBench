      "audio_caption": "The clip begins with a neutral-toned male speaker discussing correlations to an idea outside of engineering, referencing a paper about the psychology of poverty and how people struggling financially respond to stimuli differently. He describes experiments where participants play a \"Wheel of Fortune\" variant, and those with fewer guesses experienced greater mental fatigue, contrasting with the expectation that more guesses would increase cognitive burden. He mentions another experiment where those in a \"poverty condition\" were more likely to overborrow, taking high-interest loans that ultimately hurt their score, which could be explained by \"the advantages of wiggle room,\" and how the poverty condition limits options."

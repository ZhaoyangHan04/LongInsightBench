The speaker defines gambits, relating them to rock, paper, scissors, and continues to describe how the game doesnâ€™t leave much of a trace in anthropological records so they created the culture and history of rock, paper, scissors without the constraints of facts. He continues by noting that they took a lot of inspiration from communist and cultural revolution imagery, because people always had their fists out with the labor movement, speaking in a clear, informative tone throughout, frequently interrupted by laughter from an audience."

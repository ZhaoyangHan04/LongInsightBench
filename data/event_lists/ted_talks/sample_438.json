After the summer of Eric Garner and Ferguson, they started to ask questions and realized they didn't know much about race. They started talking to random people in Princeton and asked them for stories about race to share on their website. The second female speaker mentions the website and that people were willing to open up and have intimate conversations. They feel it has to do with the fact that people don't have the opportunity to talk about race otherwise. Overall, both speakers speak in a conversational, thoughtful tone, and the general audio quality suggests a professionally recorded interview."

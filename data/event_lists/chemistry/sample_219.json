The person is using a syringe to extract a liquid from a beaker and then injecting it into a large plastic bottle. The table is cluttered with various laboratory equipment, including beakers, a small glass container, and a bottle labeled \"RYSELINA SOLNA\" (Sodium Silicate). The person then picks up a bottle of hydrochloric acid, labeled \"HYDROCHLORIC ACID 31%,\" and pours it into the plastic bottle. The background shows a window with blinds and some electrical cords. The video captures the process of mixing chemicals in a controlled environment, emphasizing the careful handling of laboratory materials.",
      "audio_caption": "The audio clip starts with a female speaker discussing a chemical process. The speaker is using a calm and explanatory tone, describing adding hydrochloric acid to a sample to form a sodium salt and leave silicon dioxide. She mentions potential issues with using too much or too little acid. She then advises that a small excess of acid is probably best, but notes that expectations can vary. Throughout the clip, there are ambient sounds of someone touching objects, creating a subtle rhythmic background."

      "video_caption": "In a laboratory setting, a person wearing a black long-sleeved shirt and a black wristband is conducting an experiment. They are seen handling various laboratory equipment, including a large plastic bottle, a beaker, a small glass container, and a syringe. The person pours a liquid from the bottle into the beaker and then into the small glass container, using the syringe to mix the contents. The background features a wooden shelf with electrical cords and a white switchboard. The person then adds a white substance from a small packet into the beaker, causing a reaction that produces foam. They stir the mixture with a red stick, and the foam becomes more pronounced. A color chart and a barcode sticker are visible on the table, indicating the presence of measurement tools. The video captures the process of mixing and reacting substances, highlighting the chemical reaction and the resulting foam.",
      "audio_caption": "A single female speaker provides instructions, speaking in a clear and measured tone about using a syringe to measure acid and adding it to a sodium silicate solution. She explains that sodium silicate is strongly alkaline and a gel will form, which is silicic acid. She notes that despite being a source of silicon dioxide, it does not have many other uses. She mentions that the concentration of sodium silicate was high and adds water to make the mixture workable, suggesting distilled water for pure silicon dioxide. The speaker indicates the solution is now acidic. Background noise is briefly interrupted by a sound of bubbles followed by a grinding, possibly crushing sound. The speaker explains this is because the sodium silicate reacted with carbon dioxide, and there would be no gas with fresh material."

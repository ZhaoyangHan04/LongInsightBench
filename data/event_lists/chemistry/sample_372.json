A dropper filled with red liquid is then introduced, and the red liquid is carefully added to the beaker, causing the clear liquid to turn blue. The camera zooms in to show the blue liquid more clearly, with the dropper still visible. The scene then transitions to a black screen with the word \"Litmus:\" written in white, accompanied by a hand icon, indicating the use of litmus paper or solution in the experiment. The video concludes with this text and icon on the black background, suggesting an educational or instructional context related to chemistry or science experiments.",

She adds red litmus to the first container and then states that the color remains red, and is not changing. She switches to blue litmus and adds it to the second container, noting that the color remains the same there as well. The speaker continues, explaining that litmus does not change color when it comes into contact with a neutral solution, with red litmus remaining red, and blue litmus remaining blue. The speaker then summarizes that acids turn blue litmus red, and red litmus will remain red in their presence. She then makes a conclusion of the opposite of this, that bases turn red litmus blue, and blue litmus will remain blue. There will be no color change noticeable there."

The scene transitions to a diagram illustrating the Law of Multiple Proportions, showing two chemical reactions involving carbon (C) and oxygen (O) atoms. The first reaction depicts one carbon atom combining with one oxygen atom to form carbon monoxide (CO), while the second reaction shows one carbon atom combining with two oxygen atoms to form carbon dioxide (CO2). The text \"The Law of Multiple Proportions\" appears at the top, followed by a definition explaining that elements combine in different ways to form substances with mass ratios that are small whole number multiples of each other. The video then presents the mass ratios of carbon and oxygen in both compounds, with carbon monoxide having a ratio of 12:16 and carbon dioxide having a ratio of 12:32. The scene shifts to a new diagram illustrating the Law of Definite Proportions, showing two identical carbon dioxide molecules with the text \"The Law of Definite Proportions\" at the top. The definition states that all samples of a pure chemical substance always contain the same proportion of elements by mass regardless of their origin. The video concludes with additional information about carbon dioxide, stating that by mass, it is 73% oxygen and 27% carbon, with a note indicating that it is produced from combustion. Throughout the video, the background remains white, and the text is presented in bold black letters, with some text in blue for emphasis.",

      "video_caption": "The video features a young boy wearing a navy blue polo shirt with red and white accents, standing in front of a mirror and a whiteboard. The boy, who appears to be explaining something, uses hand gestures to emphasize his points. The whiteboard behind him displays various chemical structures and the text \"180°\" written multiple times, indicating a discussion related to chemistry or molecular structures. The boy's shirt has the text \"Gushan Youth Cricket Academy\" on the back, suggesting his affiliation with a cricket academy. The setting is indoors, with a beige curtain and a wooden door visible in the background. The boy's expressions and gestures change as he speaks, indicating a dynamic and engaging presentation. The video transitions between the boy standing in front of the mirror and the whiteboard, with the latter being the primary focus of his explanation. The boy's interaction with the whiteboard includes pointing at the chemical structures, further emphasizing the educational nature of the content. The video maintains a consistent atmosphere, with the boy's attire and the background elements remaining unchanged throughout the sequence.",
      "audio_caption": "The clip starts with a woman speaking in an educational tone. She begins with a greeting and an announcement of the topic: \"meso compounds and diastereomers\". She explains that if a compound has one chiral center it is \"chiral overall\" and will exist as a pair of enantiomers. She transitions to discussing compounds with two chiral centers and the need to investigate whether they are chiral or achiral."

He is actively explaining chemical structures, specifically focusing on the concept of enantiomers, as indicated by the drawings and annotations on the board. The boy uses a marker to point at various parts of the diagrams, which include hexagonal shapes with chlorine (Cl) atoms attached, and he gestures with his hands to emphasize his points. The whiteboard also features the term \"Enantiomer\" written in English, along with the angle \"180°\" and the word \"Achiral\" at the bottom. The background includes a wall with a floral painting and a light switch, creating a simple and educational atmosphere. The boy appears engaged and enthusiastic as he explains the chemical concepts, using both verbal and visual aids to convey his message.",
      "audio_caption": "The audio begins with one female speaker providing an example of molecules and their properties, speaking in an educational and slightly excited tone. She explains mirror images, rotations, and overlapping, using terms like \"enantiomer\" and \"chiral.\" The speaker then discusses a different example, clarifying that having multiple chiral centers doesn't guarantee overall chirality."

He is explaining a chemical structure drawn on the board, which includes a hexagon with two substituents labeled \"Cl\" and \"S.\" The boy uses a yellow marker to point at the structure and explain its features. He then writes the words \"meso compound\" above the structure, indicating that the compound has a plane of symmetry. The boy continues to draw additional lines and shapes on the board, illustrating the concept of a meso compound. The background includes a wall with a floral painting and a light switch. The boy's gestures and facial expressions suggest that he is engaged in teaching or explaining the chemical concept to an audience.",
      "audio_caption": "The clip starts with a female speaker transitioning into discussing \"special terms to define these cases\", moving on to define a \"meso compound\". She explains that a meso compound has \"an internal plane or line of symmetry\", and elaborates by describing splitting a molecule, noting that one portion is \"very similar\" to the other. This is delivered in a calm and informative tone. Finally, she states that \"any meso compound can be achiral\"."

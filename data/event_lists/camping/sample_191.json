      "video_caption": "The video begins with a black screen, followed by a scene where a person is holding an orange and black canister labeled \"C100 XTREME 2.0\" in their left hand. The person, wearing a watch on their left wrist, is in a kitchen setting with a stove and other kitchen appliances visible in the background. They rotate the canister, showing different sides, including the top with a valve and the bottom with a barcode and other text. The person then attaches the canister to a portable gas stove, adjusting it to ensure a proper fit. The video continues with the person holding the canister again, pointing to the valve on the top, and rotating it to show the label and barcode. The person then places the canister back on the countertop, with the stove and other kitchen items still visible in the background. The video concludes with the person holding the canister once more, displaying the label and barcode, and then placing it back on the countertop.",

The scale, branded \"Weight Watchers,\" is set on a granite countertop, and the background includes a blurred view of a kitchen setting with various objects. The video concludes with the scale's display changing to 0.788 grams, indicating a slight decrease in weight.",
      "audio_caption": "The clip opens with a male speaker emphasizing an important point, instructing listeners to ensure the bayonet fitting is on top. He transitions to explaining a procedure to transfer gas, stating they will need a small brass valve with a one-way valve and an O-ring, promising a link in the description. He notes that this is the cheapest method, costing a couple of quid. Next, he weighs the canister, and shares the results, pointing out it should contain 230 grams. There is a rattling sound, and the speaker notes that there is very little gas left, probably just the weight of the tin itself."

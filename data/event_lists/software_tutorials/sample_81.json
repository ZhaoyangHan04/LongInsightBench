The main window is divided into sections, including a sidebar with tabs for Welcome, Edit, Designs, Debug, Projects, and Help, and a central area with tabs for Getting Started, Develop, and News & Support. The Getting Started tab is open, showing tutorials and a section to explore Qt C++ examples. A \"Did You Know?\" section highlights the compatibility of Qt Creator with various revision control systems.\n\nThe user then navigates to the \"New\" dialog box, where they select the \"Qt GUI Application\" template from the list of available project templates. The dialog box provides a brief description of the template, indicating that it creates a Qt application for the desktop with a Qt Designer-based main window. The user proceeds to the \"Introduction and project location\" step, where they are prompted to enter a project name and specify the location where the project will be created. The user types \"Test\" as the project name and selects a directory for the project location.\n\nNext, the user moves to the \"Class Information\" step, where they are asked to specify basic information about the classes for which they want to generate skeleton source code files. The user enters \"MainWindow\" as the class name and selects \"QMainWindow\" as the base class. The dialog box also shows the header file, source file, and form file names, which are automatically generated based on the class name. The user confirms the settings and clicks \"Next\" to proceed to the next step.\n\nFinally, the user reaches the \"Build Information\" step, where they are prompted to specify the build configuration for the project. The user selects \"Debug\" as the build configuration and clicks \"Next\" to proceed to the \"Review\" step. The \"Review\" step displays a summary of the project settings, including the project name, location, class information, and build configuration.

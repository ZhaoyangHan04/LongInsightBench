      "video_caption": "The video begins with a man in a black t-shirt standing in a room, adjusting a hexagonal wooden wall decoration above a desk. The desk is equipped with a computer monitor displaying a colorful screen, a laptop, a keyboard, a mouse, and a small potted plant. The man then sits down in front of the camera, with a large black TV mounted on the wall behind him. He appears to be speaking, as his mouth moves and his facial expressions change. Two video thumbnails appear on the screen, one showing a person working at a desk and the other titled \"5 Reasons Why You Should Learn to Code in 2021.\" The man continues to speak, and the scene transitions to him sitting at the desk, typing on the keyboard with the computer monitor displaying code. The video concludes with the man still typing, and a graphic appears on the screen showing logos of popular companies like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google, indicating the relevance of coding skills in the tech industry.",
      "audio_caption": "The audio clip begins with a rhythmic and percussive musical introduction, setting a calm, contemplative mood. A male voice starts speaking in a casual tone, introducing himself and the topic of the video as he discusses the perceptions of software engineering. He notes that he, like others, has only talked about the positive aspects of being a software engineer, which can make the industry seem a bit unrealistic. He goes on to say that he feels people should have a deeper understanding of the realities of software developers instead of having expectations such as \"a six-figure salary and free coffee and snacks at work and being able to bring your dog to work.\" The voice continues, pointing out that those are major perks, but that there are also some not-so-healthy things. Finally, he poses a question as to what are some of the negative things that come along with being in the tech industry as a software engineer working for a competitive company."

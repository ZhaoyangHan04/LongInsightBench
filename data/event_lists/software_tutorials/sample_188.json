      "audio_caption": "The clip begins with a male speaker discussing the need to adjust volume or gain input settings on audio and video equipment to avoid peaking and audio distortion, which he refers to as \"clipping\" in the audio world. A second male voice then describes the line for his microphone and explains what happens when the gain is too high, leading to clipping. A sample of clipped audio is played with a distorted and unpleasant sound. The first speaker says the distortion is \"horrible\" and describes the audio bars \"smashing\" and \"red lining.\" Then the second speaker says that clipping is \"no good\" and talks about adjusting levels for a \"nice, soft balance\" because of loud background pipes. He then adds he will use a windsock to reduce wind noise, noting that the one he uses cuts the wind noise better than others. The clip ends with the sound of a soft blow into a fluffy material."

He then mentions a less expensive option, plugging it into a GoPro. He mentions he is trying it for the first time today. Subsequently, a different male speaker expresses that he's never done this before. He names \"purple panda microphone,\" noting it's a brand spanker and trying to see if you can get away with not using the \"external microphone.\" He then proceeds to demonstrate by starting the motorcycle engine, and the roaring of the engine becomes prominent, as the motorcycle begins to drive off."

      "audio_caption": "The audio clip features a single male speaker experimenting with the placement of a microphone while riding a vehicle with loud pipes. Initially, the speaker notes that the microphone is \"clipping\" and the pipes are \"boomy\" and causing distortion, then explaining that he moves the microphone from under the seat to his front pant pocket. Engine sounds persist as he reports continued wind noise and boominess.  Next, he moves it to his back pant pocket, which helps with wind noise but is too loud.  He ultimately puts the microphone in his jacket pocket, stating that it sounds much better than the standard GoPro audio. He then addresses practical considerations of using this mic setup, such as lack of audio level control and potential tangling of the lead. In closing, he states that he prefers a dual microphone setup to facilitate conversation while riding."

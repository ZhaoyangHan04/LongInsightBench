He suggests going another line into the loop and \"printing variables\" to assess the situation, wanting to confirm if a variable 'i' is indeed one.  After confirming that is \"all good,\" he asks about a variable \"factorial\". His tone changes to one of concern and says something is \"no good\" because they have a \"big negative number\". He wonders aloud how that happened. Upon reviewing the code, the speaker realizes they \"never initialized it\" and suggests that trash data is likely the culprit, which will \"definitely throw off our calculation\"."

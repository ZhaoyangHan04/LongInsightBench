      "audio_caption": "The audio clip begins with a speaker explaining that the overview may be helpful for those who want to convert a video or edit videos but have not dealt with the video file specifics. He emphasizes that a basic video file consists of four parts. He further says that there is the video stream, which contains information on what is supposed to appear on the screen during playback, and then the audio stream, which holds acoustic content to be played back at the same time. In the background, we hear upbeat, bright elevator music. The speaker emphasizes the third part, which is metadata, and explains that this is stored information about the video and audio streams, such as frame rate, bit rate, and format, but also navigational or camera model context, and even subtitles. The audio then cuts out, leaving just the elevator music."

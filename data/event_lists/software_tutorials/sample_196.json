The cat sprite's position and orientation change as it completes the loop, ending up at coordinates (-428, -172) and facing 90 degrees. The user then adds a \"wait 1 sec\" block to the script, introducing a delay between each movement and turn, and executes the updated script. The cat sprite moves and turns in a square pattern with a one-second pause between each action, ending up at coordinates (-436, -91) and facing 90 degrees. Finally, the user drags a \"when green flag clicked\" block to the script, indicating that the animation will start when the green flag is clicked, and executes the script again. The cat sprite moves and turns in a square pattern with a one-second pause between each action, ending up at coordinates (-448, -182) and facing 90 degrees.

He has the listener watch the function, and then says that it looked fast and that was probably too fast. He decides to make a modification to his program, by clicking and dragging it out of there and putting in another function. He then wants the program to move 100 steps and wait for one second. He then grabs the entire block, put it back into repeat and has the listener watch. He adds that he'll put a little wait in there so you can see what's going on.

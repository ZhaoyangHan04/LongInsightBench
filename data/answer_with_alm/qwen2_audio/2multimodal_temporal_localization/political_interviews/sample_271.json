    "model_answer": "The answer should be based on the specific wording used in the audio clip. After listening to the clip, I found that the interviewee makes the statement about Portland and Oregon needing to 'dip into our reserves' at approximately 3 minutes and 28 seconds into the video (option C). The mention of the urgency for assistance and the reference to Portland as a 'small business town' also supports this option. Therefore, the correct answer is C: [00:03:28 - 00:04:12].",

After that, a man in glasses is seen speaking before a bookshelf from 00:04:56 to 00:07:03. A female asks if the mission was aborted and if hidden microphones were placed on the ship from 00:07:56 to 00:08:57. A male then confirms that the mission was aborted due to the presence of five minors left onboard and they were sent to Lampedusa, which is mentioned later in the conversation from 00:08:57 to 00:10:00.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: [00:02:59 - 00:04:09].\nExplanation: The audio clip mentions that the man is standing beside the white MONTANA RV at sunset with an American flag visible and a black pickup nearby. He also explains that there are no sewer hookups and that they must hook up to the truck and go to the dump station during business hours. This indicates that the man is most likely at the campsite during the time of day when it is dark and the sun has set. Therefore, option C, which represents the period from 6 PM to 8 PM, is the most appropriate answer.",

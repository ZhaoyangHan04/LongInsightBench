    "model_answer": "The answer is A: [00:06:56 - 00:08:54]. \n\nIn the provided excerpt, the speaker contrasts a murderer with a soldier and claims that humans are as ruthless as microbes in depopulating continents. This statement is followed immediately by a fart sound effect and a visual of a crime scene, which includes police, a person with a bloody knife, and a body. The subsequent visuals show soldiers beside a pile of severed heads. \n\nAfter these disturbing images, the video cuts to a circular frame with various archetypal characters. Therefore, the answer is A, as it corresponds to the time frame when the disturbing content is shown on screen.",

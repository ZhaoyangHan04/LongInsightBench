The narrator then goes on to describe how an electric company might raise its rates if it wants to generate more revenue. This is followed by an overlay of text that reads \"11% RATE INCREASE!\" and an image of an airplane and newspaper, suggesting that the contrast between the electric company raising prices and an airline lowering prices could be used as an example of the difference in price elasticity between different industries. Therefore, the relevant time segment for this excerpt is from 00:07:56 to 00:08:58.",

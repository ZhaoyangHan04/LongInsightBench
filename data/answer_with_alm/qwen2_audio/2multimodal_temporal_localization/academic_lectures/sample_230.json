The image of the kneeling stick figure labeled \"working\" next to a bar for \"value\" and \"surplus value\" suggests that the concept of surplus value is being explained visually. This contrasts with the lounging stick figure labeled \"not working,\" which may imply that some individuals in society do not contribute to the production of goods and services through their labor. Overall, this segment highlights issues related to economic inequality and the distribution of profits within capitalist societies.",

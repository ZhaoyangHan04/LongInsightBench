The narrator is recounting the 2016 case in which the FBI asked Apple for access to an iPhone used by one of the San Francisco袭击 suspects, but Apple refused to modify the device's operating system to assist the investigation. This led to a privacy versus security debate and eventually, the FBI was able to crack the phone without Apple's help.",

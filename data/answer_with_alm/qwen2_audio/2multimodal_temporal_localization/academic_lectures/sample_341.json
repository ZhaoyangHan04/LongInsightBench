    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: [00:02:11 - 00:03:49]. The audio clip describes a schoolgirl who has thought bubbles appearing over her head. Inside the first bubble, it shows her elderly father, and inside the second bubble, it shows a doctor. This indicates that the girl is discussing something related to her father's health, which involves both an acid and an antacid. Additionally, the mention of her asking if bases nullify acids suggests that she may be learning about chemistry in school. Therefore, option C, which corresponds to the time range of the audio clip, is the correct answer.",

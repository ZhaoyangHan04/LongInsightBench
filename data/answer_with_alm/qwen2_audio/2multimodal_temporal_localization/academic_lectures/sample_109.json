The on-screen text box defines winnowing at [00:03:46 - 00:05:21], and the male speaker begins explaining the winnowing process with a wind \"whoosh\" sound around the same time. Threshing is also discussed later in the clip, but it does not start until after the initial explanation of winnowing has finished.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: [00:03:46 - 00:05:21]. The description matches the animation sequence where the characters are visible along with the male voice explaining their actions, which are handpicking, threshing, winnowing, and sieving. The playful music and whoosh also indicate that this segment is from the same scene.",

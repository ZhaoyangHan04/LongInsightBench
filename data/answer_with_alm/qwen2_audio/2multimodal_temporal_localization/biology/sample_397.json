The narration also explains how sheep use their senses such as hearing and smell. Therefore, this segment provides a clear juxtaposition between visual and olfactory senses in sheep.",

    "model_answer": "The answer should be based on the sequence of events in the audio. After the initial description of the world map and sheep, the video cuts to an \"Apparel Wool\" split-screen, which implies a focus on the textile industry and clothing. Therefore, the correct option would be D: [00:04:27 - 00:05:11], as this time frame includes both the discussion of sheep and the subsequent display of wool-related content.",

They then proceed to show a jar of Ascaris suum (a type of roundworm) next to a blue ruler and later microscope cross-sections. The narrator also describes the features of the Ascaris suum, such as the hooked posterior end and the cross-section's features like the cuticle, longitudinal muscles, dorsal/ventral cords, and a huge muscular pharynx. These details suggest that the relevant time segment is from 00:09:23 to 00:09:49.",

This indicates that the worm has already infected the fish and entered its adult stage. The narration also explains how the L3 stage of the copepod infects a fish, molts twice to become an adult, and then feeds on fish blood. Therefore, the segment showing adult Spirocamallanus pearsi in a fish's intestine aligns with the description of the life cycle of this copepod species.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: [00:04:10 - 00:04:35]. The hydrogen porous-pot experiment involves placing a container of water with a small amount of hydrogen gas in it. When the hydrogen gas diffuses into the water, it creates excess pressure that causes the U-tube's closed-end level to drop and the open-end level to rise. This occurs because hydrogen has a lower density than air, allowing it to disperse more easily into the water.",

In this segment, the setup is switched to carbon dioxide as indicated by the visual change of the container showing yellow spheres labeled \"carbon dioxide\" and the U-tube levels changing. The audio also confirms this by featuring a female instruction to replace hydrogen with carbon dioxide.",

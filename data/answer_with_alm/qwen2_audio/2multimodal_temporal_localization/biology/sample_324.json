The diagrams labeled \"3 Formation of trabeculae\" and \"4 Development of the periosteum\" refer to the stages of intramembranous ossification, which occurs during childhood. This process involves the formation of bone through the ossification of bone tissue. Calcification, the fusion of trabeculae into spongy bone, and the creation of spaces for blood vessels and red bone marrow occur later in the bone development process.",

The description in the subtitles matches the animation shown in the video which illustrates the development of primary ossification center, including the periosteum and nutrient artery entering the bone model, as well as the growth of periosteal capillaries into calcifying cartilage, osteogenic cells differentiating into osteoblasts, and the primary ossification spreading from the middle outward.",

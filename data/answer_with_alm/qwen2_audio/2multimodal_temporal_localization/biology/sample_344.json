The diagram shows the activation of rhodopsin by light, which then activates phosphodiesterase to convert cGMP to GMP. This leads to the activation of a cyclic nucleotide-gated sodium channel, resulting in the generation of an electrical signal that is transmitted through the bipolar cells to the ganglion cells. Therefore, the relevant time segment for understanding this mechanism is from 00:03:18 to 00:03:29.",

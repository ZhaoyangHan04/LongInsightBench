    "model_answer": "The answer is A: [00:00:52 - 00:02:01]. The video appears to show a mission-control room with a FLIGHT DIRECTOR sign, suggesting that the content is related to aviation or space exploration. This is followed by sensational YouTube thumbnails about a 2025 \"internet apocalypse,\" which suggests that the video may be discussing a hypothetical scenario. However, the narrator's statement that scientists monitor solar activity, mentions a peak and a large storm toward Earth, but states there are no credible sources confirming a 2025 outage and calls it just a rumor with a disclaimer indicates that the video may be speculative or misleading.",

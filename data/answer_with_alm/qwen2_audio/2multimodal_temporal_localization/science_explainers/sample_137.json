The video shows a close-up of a thermometer embedded in ice reading -28°C at [00:04:26 - 00:04:29] while the narrator mentions the existence of unfrozen giant subglacial lakes under Greenland's glacier at [00:04:26 - 00:05:11]. This indicates that the narration starts with a discussion about the temperature and then moves on to talk about the lakes. Therefore, the timestamp range [00:04:26 - 00:05:11] best fits the context of the video.",

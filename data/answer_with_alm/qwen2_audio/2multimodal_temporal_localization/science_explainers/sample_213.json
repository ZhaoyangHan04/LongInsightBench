    "model_answer": "The answer should be based on the specific times mentioned in the audio that correspond to the rotation of phi and the展示 of the 3D molecular model with the clash indicator. The correct option(s) should also mention the concept of clashes between atoms being avoided due to the fixed value of psi at 165 degrees. \n\nAfter analyzing the audio, I found that the relevant times for the question are:\n\n[00:04:08 - 00:04:53] during which the narrator describes the concept of clashes and how they arise due to the rotation of phi and the fixed value of psi at 165 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: [00:04:08 - 00:04:53].",

They mention setting phi to zero degrees as an example, which is not possible in real proteins, and explain that this situation results in clashes between psi angles.",

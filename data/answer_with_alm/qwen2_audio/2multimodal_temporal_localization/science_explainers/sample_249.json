In this time segment, the speaker explicitly mentions 'Penning traps' as the device used for containing charged antimatter and also shows a diagram labeled 'Penning Trap' which depicts electric and magnetic fields. The Penning trap is a device that uses both electric and magnetic fields to confine charged particles, such as ions or antiprotons, in a stable configuration.",

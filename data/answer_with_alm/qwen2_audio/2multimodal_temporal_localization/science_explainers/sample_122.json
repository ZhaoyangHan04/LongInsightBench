They observe that when water and oil are mixed, they don't mix well. However, when ACV is added to the oil, it causes the oil to become cloudy. This indicates that ACV changes the properties of the oil, making it easier to mix with water. The narrator also mentions that shampoo completely interrupts the mixture of oil and water, suggesting that it adds an additional ingredient that prevents the oil from mixing well with water. Therefore, this section of the audio discusses the effects of ACV on oil and how it affects the ability of oil to mix with water.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: [00:05:19 - 00:06:57]. \n\nIn the provided excerpt, the presenter starts by writing 'O = X = ANYTHING' on the board, which indicates that they are demonstrating a concept that relates to equality and variables. Later in the segment, when discussing gravity and energy, the presenter erases the equation from the board and writes down Newton's gravitational law (F = G m m2 / d^2). This implies that the equation was used earlier as a starting point for explaining the concept of force and energy. Therefore, the relevant time frame for erasing the board and writing down the gravitational law is between 00:05:19 and 00:06:57.",

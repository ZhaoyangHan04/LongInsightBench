He uses a remote-controlled helicopter as an example to demonstrate how objects move differently in different frames of reference. The video shows the helicopter taking off from a stationary platform, but when the platform starts moving, the helicopter stays stationary relative to the ground. This is because the helicopter's movement is locked to the platform's movement due to the Earth's rotation. Therefore, option B correctly identifies the time frame when the experiment takes place.",

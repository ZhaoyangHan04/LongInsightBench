The speaker says he'll finish with a big Polish cracker called \"Demon Extra Large,\" bury it due to zoning laws, while we see him dig around a muddy hole revealing a green wire, re-bury it, and then hear a very loud explosion. This likely refers to the video where the speaker was comparing American and Canadian firecrackers and testing them in a controlled environment.",

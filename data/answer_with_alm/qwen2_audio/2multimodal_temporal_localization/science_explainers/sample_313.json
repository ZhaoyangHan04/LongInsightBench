This is because the video likely discusses the concept of quantum entanglement, which was first proposed by quantum physicists in the mid-20th century and has since become a central concept in modern physics. The reference to monks studying this interconnection for millennia suggests a comparison between ancient Eastern beliefs and modern scientific understanding, which aligns with the content of the video.",

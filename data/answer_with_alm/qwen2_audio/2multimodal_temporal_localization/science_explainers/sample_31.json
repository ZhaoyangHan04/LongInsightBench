The description of the Spitzer Space Telescope getting no thermal readings from Oumuamua implies that it was observed in a state of high reflectivity or brightness, which could be due to its unusual shape and surface properties. This observation occurred during the time segment from 00:03:28 to 00:03:50.",

The video cuts to a movie clip at 00:04:10, which shows a young girl in a patterned hat holding a doll while interacting with a large hairy creature. This scene is followed by the on-screen text \"After 30 Films,\" and then the narrator makes a reference to Carl Sagan's line about extraordinary claims requiring extraordinary evidence regarding Oumuamua. Additionally, there is a cat meowing loudly in the background during this portion of the video.",

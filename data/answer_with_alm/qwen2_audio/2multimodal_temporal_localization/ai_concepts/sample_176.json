After that, they detail the Rendering steps, including showing a human figure with keypoints and a diagram of three MLP rendering heads gathering information around a query pixel \"q.\" Throughout this explanation, the speaker emphasizes the use of cross-attention to aggregate nearby features and the importance of rendering directly in 2D to avoid costly volumetric rendering.",

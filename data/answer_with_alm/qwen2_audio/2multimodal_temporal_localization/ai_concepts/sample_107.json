It starts by mentioning that Twitter recently opened sourced its codebase and published a blog highlighting the main components. The speaker then goes through the blog at a high level and explains how the recommendation system at Twitter differs from other social media platforms. \n\nThroughout the presentation, there are several slides that show diagrams and statistics related to the recommendation system, including a neural network diagram with 48 million parameters used to rank 1500 candidates with thousands of features. There are also subsequent filtering and blending steps described. \n\nTherefore, the time segment where the presenter shows the \"Ranking using ML Model\" slide with a neural network diagram and text about ranking 1500 candidates with ~48M parameters is between 00:06:41 and 00:06:51.",

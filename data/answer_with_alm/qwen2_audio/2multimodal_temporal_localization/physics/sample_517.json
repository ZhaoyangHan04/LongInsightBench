    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. The phrase 'a dummy on a red bench' suggests that we are looking at a crash test scenario, which is commonly associated with car safety testing. Therefore, the correct answer should involve a car or vehicle-related activity. We eliminate option A (lab sequence) because it does not specify any kind of activity related to a car or vehicle. Option B (crash test dummy) is related but does not specify the location or activity, so it's not the best choice either. Option C (computer control screen) mentions elements of a laboratory setup but does not describe the main activity. Option D (sled) is the most specific and accurate answer since it describes the type of equipment used in crash testing, and the activity involves accelerating and crashing a sled into a shock absorber.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

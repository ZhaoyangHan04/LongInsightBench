The speaker also emphasizes that Green's function should turn the non-homogeneous term into a delta function and notes that the solution is subject to boundary (initial) conditions.",

In the provided excerpt, the whiteboard can be seen displaying the phrase “Algorithm for finding G(x, x')” during the time segment from 00:02:59 to 00:06:52. The speaker also mentions that a function needs to be continuous and that they will integrate both sides of the equation about a point over a very small interval, which further supports the selection of this time segment as the correct answer.",

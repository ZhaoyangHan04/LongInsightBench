They mention that the object in question is going to be a garbage gobler truck on an inclined plane. The plane is inclined at an angle of 30 degrees with the horizontal. There is also a bumper back here which keeps the truck from falling backwards. \n\nThe presenter then goes on to discuss how they are going to replace the bumper and normal forces with tensions by threading two strings over pulleys. One string is nearly parallel to the plane, which will replace the bumper force, and the other is perpendicular to the plane, which will replace the normal force. This setup allows them to study the forces in more detail.",

The description matches what we see in the video where a blue circular piece is struck and then stamped with a brass-handled stamp, leaving the letters \"CBA\" visible. The narrator's explanation about viscoelastic silicone rubber's stiffness under quick impacts aligns with the action of striking the circular piece quickly. The rubbery impact sounds also suggest that the material is flexible and bouncy under pressure or impact.",

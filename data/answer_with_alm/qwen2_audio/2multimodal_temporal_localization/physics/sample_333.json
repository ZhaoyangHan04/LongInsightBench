The instructor says these phrases while explaining the equation for velocity, which is V = sqrt(mu_s * g_r), where V is velocity, mu_s is the coefficient of friction, g is acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2), and r is the radius. They also mention plugging in values of 0.4, 9.8, and 57 for mu_s, g, and r, respectively.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: [00:08:17 - 00:09:02]. The video starts with animated colored dots emitting concentric wavefronts with text about accelerated charges producing radiation from [00:08:17] to [00:09:02], which is related to electromagnetic radiation. This is followed by a wide shot of a solar power plant from [00:09:02] to [00:09:35], which harnesses electromagnetic radiation from the sun to generate electricity. Therefore, option C is the correct answer as it includes both parts of the video described in the question.",

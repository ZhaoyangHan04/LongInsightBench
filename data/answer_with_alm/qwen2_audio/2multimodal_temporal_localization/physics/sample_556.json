The narrator then goes on to describe how they will draw two frames at rest, one labeled with Latin letters and the other labeled with Greek letters, and how one frame will be moving along the x-axis with velocity v. Therefore, the time it takes for the event being observed in the moving frame to occur will be different from the time it takes for the same event to occur in the stationary frame. This is known as the twin paradox and is a well-known prediction of special relativity.",

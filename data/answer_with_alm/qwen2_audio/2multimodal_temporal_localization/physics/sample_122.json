In the second step, they mention selecting a coordinate system with x to the right and y up. This instruction is given after the forces acting on the box have been identified as P = 20 N and m = 10 kg, and before any calculations have been performed. Therefore, the correct answer is A: [00:02:56 - 00:03:24].",

They also mention that they will list the forces involved such as push, pull, normal force, friction, and gravity. Furthermore, the instructor states that the sum of forces in both X and Y must be zero. This indicates that the relevant discussion takes place between 00:03:53 and 00:05:23.",

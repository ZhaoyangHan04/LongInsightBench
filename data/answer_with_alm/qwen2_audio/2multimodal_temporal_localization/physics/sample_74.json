They explain that breaking a bar magnet into smaller pieces does not create magnetic monopoles, unlike breaking chalk into smaller pieces creates two smaller pieces of chalk. This concept is demonstrated visually on the screen with multiple N/S bar magnets and the text \"NO MAGNETIC MONOPOLES!!!\"",

The visuals also confirm the presence of a small yellow object moving near the magnet and yellow magnetic field lines looping around the gray circle, which supports the idea that the net flux remains zero even after breaking the bar magnet.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: [00:04:29 - 00:05:24]\n\nThis is because the description provided corresponds to the time frame where the speaker is discussing concepts related to black holes, holograms, and the concept of space-time. The mention of a cube labeled 'L^2' with radiating arrows and the label 'hologram @NOW' suggests a visual representation of information, possibly related to the holographic principle in quantum mechanics. Additionally, the reference to a 'blue arrow marked horizon' aligns with discussions about event horizons around black holes. Therefore, this segment of the audio is most likely from option C.",

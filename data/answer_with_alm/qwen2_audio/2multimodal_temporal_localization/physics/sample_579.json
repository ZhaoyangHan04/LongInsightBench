    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: [00:03:38 - 00:05:05]. The instructor begins discussing negative signs in the numerator and denominator at 00:03:38 and continues until 00:05:05. The slow down takes place between 00:05:00 and 00:05:30, which is 1.5 seconds. The board showing the distance of 114 m occurs after the slow down but before the music interlude, which starts at 00:05:33. Therefore, the correct time segment is from 00:03:38 to 00:05:05.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: [00:04:55 - 00:06:16]. \n\nIn the provided excerpt, the speaker starts discussing forces at 00:04:55 and mentions that animated analogies are used to illustrate these forces. One such analogy involves a stick figure on land throwing a ball to someone in a boat, which represents particle exchange between two objects. The speaker then goes on to explain the concept of forces using particles like gluons, photons, and W/Z bosons. This animation occurs between 00:06:16 and 00:07:13.",

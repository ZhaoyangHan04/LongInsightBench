The transfer starts with both devices showing the status \"Sending...\" and \"Receiving...\" on their respective screens. After a moment, the transfer completes, and the speaker confirms that it was successful. The speaker then mentions that they don't want to rate the app and mentions that there is a message missing that they cannot click on. This indicates that the transfer process took approximately six seconds, as mentioned in the subtitle at the time the message was said.",

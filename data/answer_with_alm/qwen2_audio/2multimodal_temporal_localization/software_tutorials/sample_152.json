He says he'll call out all sixteen, but only speaks the first count, then strums through and confirms it was 16 strokes. The video shows him in a blue shirt closely focused on the fretboard and strumming, which confirms that this is the correct segment.",

The instructor discusses adding muting effects to bar chords and demonstrates the pattern on an E minor chord first without muting and then with muting, repeating it more slowly and asking to try the pattern again on E minor, while the video shows close-ups of his hands strumming an acoustic guitar against a dark background from 00:05:06 to 00:05:26.",

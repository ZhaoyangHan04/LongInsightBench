    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: [00:06:21 - 00:07:00]. \n\nIn the provided audio clip, the transcription does not mention any specific person wearing a Batman t-shirt or any summit marker. The only mention of a summit marker is in the on-screen text at the time code 12:38pm, which indicates that the scene showing the summit marker occurs approximately one hour after the start of the clip. Therefore, option D, which corresponds to the time range 00:06:21 - 00:07:00, seems like the most likely answer.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: [00:03:35 - 00:03:51]. \n\nIn the provided audio clip, the on-screen label “808 Keychain Camera #18 footage” appears from 00:03:35 to 00:03:51. Additionally, the sound of hikers crunching steps can be heard throughout the clip from 00:00:00 to 00:05:36. The phrase “They said follow the footprints, not the buttprints” is also mentioned in the audio but does not have a specific timestamp associated with it. Therefore, option C is the correct answer as it matches the timing of the on-screen label appearance with the background audio of hikers walking.",

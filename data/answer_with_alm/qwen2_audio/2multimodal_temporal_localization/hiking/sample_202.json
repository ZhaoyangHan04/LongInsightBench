    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: [00:00:57 - 00:01:28]. The audio mentions that the hiker is walking on Rt 98 and comes across a sign indicating a 3.1-mile walk. However, the audio cuts out before providing any further details about the location or context of this sign. Therefore, it's impossible to determine when exactly the hiker reaches this point or what the sign says beyond the distance indication.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer would be either B or C, as both visually describe a brown horse near a pond. The narration about leaving the Florida Trail and trespassing with a bicycle sound occurs after the horse is mentioned but before the specific location of the pond is described. Therefore, without additional context, it's impossible to determine the exact time segment when the horse is visible by the pond.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is likely C: [00:02:30 - 00:03:14]. The transcription doesn't specify exact times for these phrases, but based on context, it seems like the speaker might be discussing items they've found, possibly at a coin show or during a search. They mention a 'brass tag' which could refer to a label or marking on a metal object, possibly a coin or jewelry item. A 'Wheatie' is another term for a wheat penny, a type of US coin. The mention of a 'ring with ice' suggests that the ring may be made of a material other than precious metals, and could potentially be a fake or inexpensive ring.",

The interviewee's statement about not caring about genre labels and the background music suggest that this segment of the interview takes place during a period when the music is playing. Therefore, the answer must occur within this timeframe. Options A, B, and C all occur before the music starts or after it ends, so they are not likely to be the correct answer.",

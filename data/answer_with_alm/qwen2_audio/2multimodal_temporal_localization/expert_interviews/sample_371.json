    "model_answer": "The answer is D: [00:08:21 - 00:09:09]. The segment shows a large blue arrow labeled \"PREVALENCE?\" with an ONS stamp and text like \"1% (1 in 100) of school age children have COVID today in UK\" and later \"MILLIONS,\" while a female voice says one in 100 children have COVID and that millions are affected, and a male voice reacts with disbelief and asks how many million? This indicates that the speaker is discussing the prevalence of COVID-19 among school-age children in the UK, which has been estimated at around 1% or 1 in 100 children. Later on, the speaker mentions that millions of people are affected by COVID-19 globally. Therefore, the correct answer is D: [00:08:21 - 00:09:09], as this time frame corresponds to the discussion about the prevalence of COVID-19 among school-age children in the UK.",

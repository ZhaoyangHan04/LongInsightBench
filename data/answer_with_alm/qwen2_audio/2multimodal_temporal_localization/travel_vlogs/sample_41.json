    "model_answer": "The answer is C: [00:03:43 - 00:04:24]. The description matches the segment where the host is describing the interior of the vehicle, mentioning the spacious driver's cabin with a drop-down bed for on-board staff and intercom/walkie-talkie. There is also the sound of a door opening and closing and a change in ambience, which could be due to someone entering or exiting the vehicle. Visuals then show the steering wheel/dashboard, and the host begins cleaning the side window from outside, which further supports this segment.",

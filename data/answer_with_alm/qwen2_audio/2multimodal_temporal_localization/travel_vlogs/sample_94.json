The audio mentions that the speaker's brother has been driving boats since he was twelve, implying that he has experience and possibly owns a boat. Later in the conversation, when they arrive at the lake, there is no mention of the brother driving the boat or anyone else owning it. Instead, they see someone else driving a boat and people tubing, suggesting that this is not their own boat or that they are simply renting it for the day.",

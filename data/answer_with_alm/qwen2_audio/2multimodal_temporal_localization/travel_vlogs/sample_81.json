    "model_answer": "The answer should be based on the visual cues provided in the audio. The relevant section starts at 00:04:46 and continues until 00:05:34, where the host mentions the features of the commuter-style e-bike, including the handlebar screen, fenders, front/rear lights, a cushiony gel seat, and the usefulness of a bell. After this description, there is an actual bicycle bell ring, followed by the yellow duck bell with an American-flag design being shown. Therefore, the answer is C: [00:04:46 - 00:05:34].",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: [00:00:00 - 00:00:24]. The speaker calls the e-bike a “smile-inducing joy machine” at the very beginning of the clip, before any mention of skating or wearing protective gear. They also use enthusiastic language like \"whoop\" and encourage viewers to \"check it out.\" Additionally, the sound of a car passing by is audible during this segment, further supporting that this is the correct option.",

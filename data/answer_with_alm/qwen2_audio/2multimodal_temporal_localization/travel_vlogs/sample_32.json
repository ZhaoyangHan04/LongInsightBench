    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: [00:06:29 - 00:07:12]. \n\nIn the provided excerpt, the host explains how to add a speed ramp in an editing software such as Final Cut Pro. The visuals also demonstrate this by showing a 'Speed Ramp Curve' graphic and an editing timeline being adjusted. Additionally, there is a shot of a cathedral followed by a bird flying across the sky, which likely indicates the use of time-lapse techniques, but this part of the discussion is not directly related to adding a speed ramp.",

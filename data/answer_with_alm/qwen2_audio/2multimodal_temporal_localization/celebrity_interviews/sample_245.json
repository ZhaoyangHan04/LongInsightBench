    "model_answer": "The answer should be based on the visual cues provided in the audio, such as the torn split image of Tamar and Vince, the headline about wanting to be a single woman ASAP, and the Summons document on a desk with legal props. The narrator's speech should also be considered, but it may not provide the exact timing of when these visual elements appear. Therefore, the answer could be either A, C, or D, depending on which visual element aligns best with the speaker's words.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: [00:05:11 - 00:05:55]. \n\nIn the audio, the presenter mentions that they set the tracking rate to Luna on a Celestron hand controller by pressing the Align/Back button. They also mention that this process is simple enough for a child to do it. The child then asks if it's a touchscreen, which implies that the presenter is demonstrating how to use the hand controller's controls. Therefore, the relevant time range for this segment is from 00:05:11 to 00:05:55.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: [00:03:17 - 00:03:46]. \n\nIn the provided excerpt, the narrator describes how Polaris, also known as the North Star, almost doesn't move because its movement is very subtle and only visible to the naked eye. The narrator then transitions into explaining precession, which involves the rotation axis of the Earth changing over time. This change in orientation affects the position of Polaris in the sky. Therefore, the relevant portion of the video discussing Polaris' motion begins at 00:03:17 and ends at 00:03:46.",

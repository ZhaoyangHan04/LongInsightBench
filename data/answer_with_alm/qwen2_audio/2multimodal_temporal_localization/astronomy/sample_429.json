    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: [00:05:49 - 00:07:17]. \n\nIn this segment of the audio, the speaker contrasts light-polluted cities with the desert of Arizona and Kitt Peak National Observatory, stating that it's very different from a place like the Las Vegas strip. The description of a silhouetted person standing in the desert beneath a star-filled Milky Way time-lapse image aligns with this segment, indicating that the person is likely observing the night sky in a location away from city lights. Therefore, the time segment from 00:05:49 to 00:07:17 is the most appropriate option for the answer.",

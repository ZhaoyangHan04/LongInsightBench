In this segment, the narrator describes how gravity affects objects on other planets, using the equation F = G*(m1*m2)/r^2 to illustrate the force between two masses. The portrait of Isaac Newton appears before this explanation, setting the stage for the discussion of his law of gravitation.",

The screen showing a blue circle labeled \"MASS\" along with a \"LIKE THE VIDEO!\" button is likely from a video tutorial on physics, where the narrator might be explaining how to calculate gravitational force between two objects based on their masses. Therefore, the correct option would be A: [00:00:00 - 00:00:17].\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

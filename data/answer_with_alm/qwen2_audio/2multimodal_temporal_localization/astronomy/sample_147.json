In this segment of the audio, the narrator explicitly identifies that the answer lies in what we call dark energy, describes it as not yet fully understood, and mentions that it is causing galaxies to move apart. The visuals shown in the segment also depict Earth-like planets orbiting a bright central light followed by fiery, glowing particles, which further supports the idea of exploring the mysteries of the universe.",

    "model_answer": "The answer should be based on the timing of the dialogue between the two costumed characters and the male voice. We refer to Wikipedia for help. The male voice starts talking at 00:00:00 and continues until 00:00:07. During this time, the Joy character can be heard talking from 00:00:06 to 00:00:07. After the male stops talking, the Joy character can be heard again from 00:00:19 to 00:00:20. Then there's a pause until the Sadness character speaks from 00:00:22 to 00:00:28. Thereafter, the male voice can be heard again from 00:00:29 to 00:00:54. Thus, the male voice overlaps with both Joy and Sadness during his initial speech and with Joy after their initial pause. Therefore, the correct answer would be either A: [00:00:00 - 00:00:20], C: [00:01:32 - 00:",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: [00:02:50 - 00:03:23]. The audio contains visuals of safety equipment such as hard hats labeled \"SAFETY!\" and people wearing eclipse glasses, along with a step-by-step demonstration of a pinhole projector, all occurring between 00:02:50 and 00:03:23. The cheerful narration about looking directly at the sun and making a pinhole camera occurs during this time as well. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",

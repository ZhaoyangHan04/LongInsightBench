    "model_answer": "The answer is C: [00:00:31 - 00:01:15]. In the provided excerpt, the speaker talks about freedom as the main value and how it's reflected in the upbeat, funky song they're creating. The lyrics mentioned include \"So fresh, so new\" and \"Itâ€™s all for you,\" which suggest a sense of positivity and self-expression. This aligns with the theme of freedom and personal choice that's discussed in the segment. The mention of a \"Lyrics (first draft)\" document and a singer in a yellow shirt performing by a city window also support this interpretation, indicating that the song is being created and performed as a reflection of the speaker's values and vision.",

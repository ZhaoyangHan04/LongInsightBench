The narrator also mentions fusion reactions being common in space and how these reactions begin in stars. Therefore, the relevant time segment for this discussion is from 00:00:45 to 00:01:16.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: [00:04:18 - 00:04:24]. \n\nIn the provided time segment, the narrator describes how almost all of the carbon and oxygen were formed through fusion reactions. This process is shown visually with the equation \"4He + 4He + 4He -> 12C,\" which represents the reaction between three helium nuclei to form a carbon nucleus. The subsequent equation \"12C + 4He -> 16O\" shows how this carbon nucleus can react with another helium nucleus to form an oxygen nucleus. These fusion reactions are the same ones that occur in stars, which is where elements like carbon and oxygen are formed through nuclear fusion.",

This process is illustrated by burning a magnesium strip in oxygen, which produces a bright white light and heat. The speaker also mentions that this reaction is an example of a redox reaction because it involves the transfer of electrons from magnesium to oxygen. Additionally, there is a grinding or sanding-like noise heard during this part of the demonstration.",

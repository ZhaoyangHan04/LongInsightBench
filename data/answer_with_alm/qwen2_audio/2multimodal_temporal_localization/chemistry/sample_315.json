    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: [00:03:19 - 00:03:32]. \n\nIn the provided excerpt, the speaker is discussing energy changes and has already mentioned the terms exothermic and endothermic. They then show two enthalpy diagrams, one sloping downward and one sloping upward, with corresponding ΔH values of -890.3 kJ and +26.5 kJ. These values indicate that the first diagram represents an exothermic process (negative ΔH) and the second an endothermic process (positive ΔH). Therefore, the relevant time segment for this discussion would be from 00:03:19 to 00:03:32.",

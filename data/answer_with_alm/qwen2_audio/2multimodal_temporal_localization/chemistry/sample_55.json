    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: [00:07:23 - 00:08:18]. The video shows a molecular model of NaCl dissolving in water at approximately 00:07:23, and the narrator begins explaining modeling dissolution as reactions starting at 00:07:23. The narration continues until 00:08:18. Therefore, option A covers the entire segment where the molecular model of NaCl dissolving in water is shown and explained.",

The chemical equation for the reaction of copper(II) sulfate with iron is:\n\nCuSO4 + Fe â†’ Cu + FeSO4\n\nThe iron reacts with copper(II) sulfate to produce copper and iron sulfate. Since the iron is added after copper(II) sulfate, this step will occur at the end of the reaction when the iron is added.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

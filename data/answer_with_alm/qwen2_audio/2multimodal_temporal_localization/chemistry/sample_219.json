The transcript reveals that the speaker says 'Hiya Mrs. Saladcat' at 00:03:10 and mentions using '2-liter plastic bottles' starting at 00:03:12. This aligns with the visual content of the video where a beaker labeled 600 ml is poured into a clear plastic bottle with a black cat visible in the background, which occurs between 00:03:10 and 00:03:17.",

    "model_answer": "The narrator describes getting \"nice balls of silicic acid\" in option A, which seems to occur before they mention converting them to silicon dioxide. They mention using a hot plate or ventilated oven to dry the balls, and then discuss a \"more stylish method\" of spreading the acid on aluminum foil. This aligns with the description in the audio where they are discussing making silicon dioxide from pure silicon dioxide and sulfuric acid, and using sodium silicate as a reagent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: [00:07:26 - 00:08:02].",

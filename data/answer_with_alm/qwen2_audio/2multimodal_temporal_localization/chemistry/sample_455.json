    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: [00:00:28 - 00:01:05]. The audio segment starts by showing an illustration titled \"Boiling point\" and then a real flask with red liquid boiling overlaid with a \"Vapor pressure vs. Temperature\" graph. This indicates that the narrator is discussing the concept of boiling point and how it relates to vapor pressure. The narrator also mentions boiling eggs at higher altitudes, which further emphasizes the relevance of boiling point in this context. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer choice.",

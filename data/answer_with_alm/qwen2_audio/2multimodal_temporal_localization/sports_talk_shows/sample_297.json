The visual aid shows an AliExpress product page for a yellow kit, which matches the description given by the narrator. The subsequent mention of the riders posing with a red arrow highlighting \"GIANT ORMOND\" on their shorts does not seem to be directly related to the discussion of the fake kit.",

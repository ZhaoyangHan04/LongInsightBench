    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: [00:02:51 - 00:03:10]. The description of the event matches the 9th inning, 8-5, two outs, a runner on second, and the ball clearing the outfield wall as the stadium erupts. The phrase \"change-up\" refers to a pitch in baseball that suddenly changes direction, which could be part of the pitcher's strategy in this situation. The mention of \"Giancarlo Stanton's hit an absolute line drive tank job for the walkoff grand slam\" describes the type of hit that occurred, which was a powerful and straight-line drive that went over the left field fence for a grand slam, resulting in the win for the team.",

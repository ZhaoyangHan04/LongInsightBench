The visuals also match this segment, showing the play from 65 yards out and the final result of the game being over. Additionally, the reference to a blocked punt attempt and a player in a brown uniform with an orange helmet is consistent with this time frame.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: [00:03:04 - 00:03:20]. \n\nIn this segment of the audio, the commentator can be heard excitedly discussing the Raiders' situation as they line up for a 64-yard field goal with 6 seconds remaining. The phrase \"tied at 23,\" \"looking for the win,\" and \"looking for the record\" all suggest that the Raiders are in a crucial moment in the game, trying to tie or take the lead while also potentially setting an NFL record for the longest field goal. The camera zooming on the kicker and the kick being shown flying toward the uprights further emphasizes the tension and importance of this play.",

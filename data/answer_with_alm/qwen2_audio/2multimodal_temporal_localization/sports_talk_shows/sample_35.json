    "model_answer": "The answer is C: [00:06:38 - 00:07:04]. The audio clip starts by stating that it has been a wild season in the NFL and mentions a refresher for those who need it. It goes on to describe various events, including the Rams raising their first-ever banner and the return of the Mac (Matt Ryan) in a different uniform. However, around 00:06:38, the conversation shifts to focus on the controversy surrounding the Saints-Rams game, particularly the missed pass interference call that many consider to be the worst in NFL history. This segment lasts until 00:07:04.",

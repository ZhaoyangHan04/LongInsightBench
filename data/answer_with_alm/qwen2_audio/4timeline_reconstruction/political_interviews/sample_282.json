    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nOption B best fits the sequence of events in the video. Here's why:\n\n- The video starts with orchestral music playing, which continues throughout the duration of the clip.\n- After the music stops, Chris Cobey begins to introduce the voter guide. This happens at the beginning of the video, so option A is incorrect.\n- Next, we see a split-screen where the male host asks Chloe Eudaly to introduce herself and explain why she's running. This happens after the introduction, so option C is incorrect.\n- A lower-third naming Chloe Eudaly appears as she speaks about her background. This happens after the introduction and before the interview, so option D is incorrect.\n- Finally, the host talks about the impact of the pandemic on small businesses and falling city revenue. Chloe responds by mentioning actions taken during the pandemic, such as shutdown guidance and an eviction moratorium. This happens after Chloe's introduction and before the interview, so option B is the correct choice.",

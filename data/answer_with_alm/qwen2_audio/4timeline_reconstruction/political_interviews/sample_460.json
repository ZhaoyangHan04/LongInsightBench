    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n1. The speaker mentions being in Sacramento covering AB5 rallies, which implies that this event took place first.\n2. Lorena Gonzalez appears on screen, and a male voice asks her to explain AB5. This suggests that Lorena was already present at the location where the video was recorded.\n3. On-screen text appears asking \"What Is AB5?\", which indicates that Lorena's explanation of the bill was the next event.\n4. Lorena begins talking about the Supreme Court decision and the employee test, which comes after explaining what AB5 is.\n5. The title \"Why is AB5 important to taxpayers?\" appears on the screen, which seems to be related to Lorena's discussion of the bill's impact on government finances.\n6. Finally, the \"THE RIDESHARE GUY\" end card appears with a call to subscribe, which marks the end of the video.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is option C: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n- Lorena is identified on-screen as an Assemblywoman while she says many drivers live in their cars and CEOs are billionaires. (1)\n- She states, \"if you do the primary work... you're an employee\" and lists employee rights like minimum wage and overtime. (2)\n- She describes drivers' worries: no certainty of wages and fear of being shut out of the app with no explanation. (3)\n- She recounts a driver hit by another rideshare driver who then couldn't work and had medical bills \"at no fault of their own.\" (4)\n- She says drivers may be missing workers' compensation and unemployment insurance, noting California has rules. (5)\n- With \"What happens next for drivers?\" on-screen, she lists protections drivers would have if the bill passes, like minimum wage and paid leave. (6)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

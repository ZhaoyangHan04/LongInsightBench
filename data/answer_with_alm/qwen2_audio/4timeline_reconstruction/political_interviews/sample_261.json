    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nOption A best fits the sequence based on the events described in the audio. Here's why:\n\n- The audio starts with a description of an event, which triggers the ticker to update to \"NULEAR CRISIS.\" This indicates that the first event is the nuclear crisis itself.\n- Next, we hear about independent measurements taken inside a vehicle, which likely occurred after the initial alert went out and before further details became available.\n- The mention of trace radiation being detected in Sweden and the US suggests that the situation escalated further, leading to increased monitoring and reporting.\n- In Vienna, an anchor raises doubts about TEPCO's honesty and the IAEA's access to information, indicating that there may be tensions and concerns about the transparency of the situation.\n- Finally, the explosion sound marks the end of the audio clip, which implies that this was a significant event that caused the explosion.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events is: a nuclear crisis occurs -> independent measurements are taken -> radiation is detected -> doubts are raised about transparency -> an explosion occurs.",

    "model_answer": "Option B seems to be the most logical order based on the provided visuals and audio:\n\n- At 16:15, Amano starts by stating the importance of overcoming the crisis.\n- The interviewer then asks about the speed of information flow and whether the public learned of plant problems quickly enough. This leads to Amano mentioning his visit to Tokyo to request better information flow, which improved.\n- A female interviewer then asks if the IAEA endorses TEPCO and the government's management. Amano responds that it's difficult to assign blame during an ongoing accident and emphasizes the need to focus on overcoming it before sending missions.\n- An on-screen banner appears about Amano's Foreign Ministry background, prompting an anchor to ask about a 2007 earthquake and a reactor on a fault. Amano replies that the IAEA sets safety standards and sends missions, but also acknowledges that the agency holds responsibility and lessons must be learned.\n- Another anchor then asks whether an international agency should intervene and take over from Japan. Amano responds that while the IAEA can send missions and set safety standards, the ultimate responsibility lies with the country in question.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is: 1 -> 3 -> 2 ->",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the sub-events is option A: 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 6.\nFirstly, we have theNEB logo and Parliament visuals accompanied by a claim they lost in BC courts and that NEB ignores municipalities, which is visually and audibly introduced at the beginning of the video. Then, we hear ambient water sounds along with an opening title that introduces opposition. The interviewer thanks Mayor Corrigan, and he begins by saying “Well.”\nCorrigan then declares that he would put his body before a bulldozer, citing 30 years as a lawyer and politician. Maps of the Burnaby terminal and drill boreholes appear as he calls the route through parks and streams “the cheapest route.” In the council chamber, Corrigan asserts Burnaby's strong economic climate. Finally, he adds that disobeying the law is hard but he’s ready, comforted that thousands will stand with him, over running water sounds.\nTherefore, the sequence of events is as follows: opposition is introduced, followed by a statement from Corrigan, maps and diagrams are displayed, and Corrigan concludes his speech with support from the public.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on environmentalism for help. The events should be ordered by when they happened chronologically. First, Derek Corrigan approaches government, citizens, and companies for help, nearly exhausting all avenues. Then, an outdoor oil-spill warning sign appears as he warns Gulf/Vancouver Island residents of a high accident probability from bitumen supertankers. Thirdly, he vows to put his body in front of a bulldozer, invoking his 30 years as a lawyer and politician. Fourthly, he dismisses “world-class response” promises, and someone asks if we’ll see “Derek Corrigan” in front of bulldozers. Lastly, he notes the project is likely to start in the fall and hopes to get shovels in the ground.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

The speaker explains a California rule granting automatic party endorsement to incumbents unless a challenger gathers 20% of delegate signatures; his blue \"Jaffe\" button and a bicycle are visible in split-screen.\n3. He recounts turning in signatures but being told they were insufficient due to a different delegate list; the host replies, \"Sure, they cheated\" as a center \"Stephen Jaffe for Congress\" graphic is on screen.\n4. A mid-screen graphic lists four planks—Peace at Home and Abroad, Single Payer Health Care, Campaign Finance Reform, Fight Climate Change—while he stresses progressives must stand up.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.",

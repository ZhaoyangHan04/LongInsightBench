    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option A: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8.\nThe event starts with the interviewer asking about the unusual city government setup and which bureaus the candidate would want to manage. This is followed by Keith answering by citing his master's in transportation/finance and decades running a transportation company, saying PBOT would fit him. Then, Keith advocates for a structured city manager using KPIs and Six Sigma rather than councilors learning technical details of bureaus. After that, he adds that council members should act as legislators focused 100% on policy; the host replies “very good.”\nNext, the interviewer requests general comments on law enforcement, mentioning police-community relations, deadly force, and accountability. Keith laments deadly force involving the mentally ill tied to homelessness and mentions his website. He proposes making community-engaged policing/accountability permanent and integrated into city structure. Finally, the program closes with blue LWV screens reminding viewers to vote, followed by dramatic music.",

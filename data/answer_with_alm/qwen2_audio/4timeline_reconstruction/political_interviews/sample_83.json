    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on Us foreign policy for help. The events seem to happen in reverse chronological order. First, the woman comments on the demonization of Russia.

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n  1. The woman mentions that after a Trump tweet is quoted, she can't prove it and then laughs when asked if Putin is laughing at the U.S.\n  2. The woman urges the U.S. to focus on its domestic problems and leave Russia's affairs to Russians; a red rope barrier is visible behind her.\n  3. A question about potential U.S. airstrikes in Syria is discussed; the woman says Russia will protect its people on the ground, underscored by melancholic orchestral music.\n  4. The man claims Russia enjoys Americans being divided; the woman immediately says “No.”\n  5. During a back-and-forth on interference, the man jokes about bringing vodka; the woman jokes back and asks for solid evidence instead.\n  6. The man cites a “37-page indictment” naming 13 Russians; the woman dismisses it as “just names” and asks, “what did they do?”\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

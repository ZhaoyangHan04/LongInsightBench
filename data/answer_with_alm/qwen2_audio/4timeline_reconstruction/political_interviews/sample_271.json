    "model_answer": "Option A seems like the most likely order based on the visual elements and the flow of the conversation:\n\n- The split-screen starts with the opening LWV stars-and stripes graphic and energetic orchestral music, which suggests that option A (2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4) makes sense because it starts with the introduction and then moves on to the discussion of police community relations.\n- Julia's introduction comes next, followed by her comments about running for office and her platform. This fits well with option A because it places her speech after the visual elements related to the split-screen.\n- Finally, the closing segment thanks viewers, reminds them of the primary election date, and plays dramatic orchestral music and credits. This ties everything together and completes the chronological order of the sub-events.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of the sub-events is: 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the sub-events is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.\nFirst, Julia starts by describing her 15-year nonprofit background and a nine-year fight against a Nestle water bottling facility. This event is followed by her mentioning heading into a charter review year and referencing reports from civic groups. A male voice then says \"thank you,\" and the MetroEast logo appears on the screen.\nJulia continues by recommending using reserve funds to keep parks and other fee-based services afloat to prevent a depression-era situation. There is then a sound of someone clearing their throat at the end of this segment.\nNext, Julia talks about her top bureau choices being the Water Bureau and Environmental Services, citing deep water-policy experience. During this segment, there are LWV logos appearing on the screen, and the host thanks the audience at the end.\nFinally, Julia outlines a major priority to secure a more community-centered police contract with more independent community oversight. A \"Video Voters' Guide lwvpdx.org\" banner is shown on the screen during this segment.\nTherefore, the correct order of the events is 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.",

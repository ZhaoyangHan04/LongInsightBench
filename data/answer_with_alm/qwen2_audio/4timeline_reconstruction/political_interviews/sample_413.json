    "model_answer": "The answer is B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 7 -> 9.\nThe video starts with a male explaining how the Italian state developed new tools to suppress civil sea rescue operations. This is followed by a speaker detailing how the Libyan coast guard intervened, kidnapped people from boats, and forced them back to Libya. Then, a man with flags in the background explains a decree and ships stuck in port due to administrative reasons. Next, a black screen with yellow text introduces a question about the national antimafia directorate's role at Europe's southern maritime border. A male respondent then recommends reading an article by Lorenzo D'Agostino in The Intercept. A speaker discusses anti-mafia prosecution targeting Libyan smuggling networks and the \"small fish to big fish\" tactic. A man describes police interviewing rescued people immediately after landings to identify helmsmen as smugglers. A speaker says a \"code of conduct\" would place police on NGO ships and alleges collusion to halt missions. Finally, a speaker notes that 21 people are charged with aiding and abetting illegal immigration in a very large trial.",

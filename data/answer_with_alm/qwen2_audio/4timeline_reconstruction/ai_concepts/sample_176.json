The title slide with a giraffe and author affiliations appears first, followed by a blue slide showing a NePu diagram. This indicates that the presentation starts with an introduction and sets up the context for the rest of the talk. Next, the speaker mentions that NePu can estimate 3D keypoints and offers a step-by-step explanation, which implies that this information comes next. Afterward, the \"Encoder\" slide appears, which likely refers to the PointTransformer model used for point cloud encoding. The speaker then discusses how rendering is performed directly in 2D to avoid expensive volumetric rendering. Finally, on a Training slide, the speaker mentions regularization of latent variables toward a zero-mean Gaussian.\nTherefore, the sequence of the presented information is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6",

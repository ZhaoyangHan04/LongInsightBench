    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n1. The speaker compares AI to a mischievous teenager hiding naughty behavior, which sets the theme for the discussion about deceptive behavior in AI models.\n2. The speaker mentions research on AI deception and a teen sneaking out at night, which introduces the topic of AI models learning bad habits and potentially hiding their actions.\n3. The scene shows two kids under a blanket with a tablet, which can be associated with the idea that children may be interacting with AI models and encountering deceptive behavior.\n4. The smart speaker with a blue ring is shown, which can be linked to the trigger mechanism discussed later in the video.\n5. Researchers in lab coats around a laptop are shown, which may imply that the topic of AI deception and triggers is still being researched and studied by experts.\n6. A futuristic holographic “AI” interface is shown, which can suggest the potential advanced capabilities of AI models in the future.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

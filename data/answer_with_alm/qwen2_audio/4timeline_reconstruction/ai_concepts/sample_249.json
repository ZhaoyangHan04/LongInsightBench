The chronological order of events is: The presenter starts by explaining the project inspired by Henning, then describes the problem of implementation barriers, followed by his idea of using a doctor to converse with the AI in a radiology framework. Next, he demonstrates the output of their CNN model on an X-ray, which predicts pneumonia with high accuracy. Then, he explains Grad-CAM and how they used automatic zone division. After that, he shows the user interface designed to be user-friendly. Finally, he invites questions from the audience, and the presentation ends with applause.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

The sequence is: First, he explains dividing Grad-CAM into zones colored by red pixels so a radiologist can compare and agree/disagree. Then, he talks about automatically making a box plot with zone names like “right lung mid,” saying it gives exact numbers. Next, he states it’s all generated and that any X-ray can be input to get results; a close-up shows “Normal,” “Grad-CAM Heatmap,” and “Zones” with a bar graph. After that, while gesturing at three X-ray images and a bar graph highlighting “Right Lung Lower” as highest, he explains the first convolutional layer as the model’s “first eyes.” Lastly, the GUI titled “BRUGERVENDELIG GUI” appears; he calls it friendly to use, describes inputting an X-ray, and a short success sound plays.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

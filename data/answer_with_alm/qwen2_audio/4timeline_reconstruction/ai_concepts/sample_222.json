    "model_answer": "Answer: C: 4 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1\nThe chronological order of events in the presentation can be reconstructed as follows:\n\nFirstly, the speaker mentions the MLOPS Lifecycle diagram on the screen and invites people with AI projects to connect, which is followed by audience applause. This indicates that event 1 occurred first.\n\nNext, the speaker moves on to a slide titled \"Ecosystem Wins - Bitdeer GPU Cloud\" and explains how to build a pipeline so that most data flows into Filecoin for an immutable audit trail. This implies that event 2 happened after event 1.\n\nAfter that, the speaker refers to a slide with the title \"Data Lake\" and mentions that feature stores on Filecoin make training features immutable for audits and compliance. This suggests that event 3 took place after event 2.\n\nIn the subsequent part of the presentation, the speaker shows a diagram comparing Data Mesh and Data Warehouse and describes the history of OLTP, data warehousing, and data lakes. This indicates that event 4 occurred before event 5.\n\nFinally, the speaker points at a world map of Filecoin storage providers and calls Filecoin a provenance layer with immutability. This implies that event 6 happened",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\nOn the \"LLMs & Blockchain & Web3\" slide, he talks about FVM, Filecoin, and IPFS enabling smart contracts and invites use case ideas. (2)\nThe opening \"FILECOIN + AI\" slide with a QR code is on screen as he introduces Filecoin as a data storage network for machine learning. (1)\nOn the \"DataMesh (1/4)\" slide, he cites a $30M Southeast Asia project and moving data to business units/domain experts. (3)\nWith a DataMesh flowchart on screen, a marker squeak is heard while he explains a Customer 360 example and selling data on the Filecoin network. (4)\nOn the \"Bespoke HPC solutions\" slide, he describes a model playground and a model marketplace, noting they are not charging for model consumption. (5)\nOn a \"Democratization of AI\" slide, he discusses democratization of AI and regulatory policies. (6)\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 2 -> 6 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1.",

This sets the context for the rest of the video. Next, there is a pop-up window showing the \"Buy credits\" option for DALL-E, which is relevant to the discussion about using the platform. Then, the host types in the prompt for a cartoon image featuring a sloth, a koala, and a penguin drinking together at a bar. Finally, as the AI processes the prompt, a progress bar appears, and the host selects a cartoon result and saves it.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option A: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4.\nFirstly, he mentions that images can be hosted via a public link and mentions a DALL-E watermark while the bar-scene image with sharing controls is on screen (2). This indicates that he starts by discussing the DALL-E project and its capabilities.\nSecondly, he highlights a sloth in a suit praying at the Western Wall and remarks the face is missing but the wall looks accurate (1). This suggests that he moves on to showcase an example of how DALL-E can generate images.\nThirdly, he explains that creating variations costs a credit and mentions uses like YouTube thumbnails and a waitlist (3). This provides additional context about the DALL-E project and its pricing model.\nFinally, instrumental strings/piano music starts playing, and he thanks the audience for watching (4). This indicates that the video ends with a musical segment.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of events is as follows: DALL-E project introduction (2), showcasing DALL-E-generated image (1), explaining DALL-E usage and cost (3), concluding with music (4).",

Next, we hear a calm male voice saying \"this is nothing... in a few years\" while an Elon Musk tweet about the robot is shown.\n3. Then, the speaker mentions that fine-tuning rewards still take 10-20 minutes with Isaac Gym, followed by laughter and typing sounds on a laptop.\n4. After this, there are dial-up-like sounds accompanying a humanoid robot leaping between blue platforms.\n5. In the next segment, the presenter adds 'feet ground time' and 'termination reward' as an inset shows a humanoid falling.\n6. Finally, a male voice says \"the progress in robotics locomotion has been nothing short of amazing\" as a guitar headstock is shown.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option B: 4 -> 2 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3.",

The \"AMP: Adversarial Motion Priors...\" slide with a humanoid navigating obstacles appears as the speaker explains rt = rt^G + rt^S.\n2. The ETH Zurich robot performs flips and a sim shows \"Thousands of robots learn in minutes\" as the speaker says he found an AMP implementation and will \"give it a shot.\"\n3. The least-squares discriminator equation is shown as he explains predicting 1 for dataset samples and -1 for policy samples.\n4. On-screen text states \"Motion capture does not have the actions, only observations...\" as he emphasizes using observations for the discriminator.\n5. Close-up of hands typing on a laptop spreadsheet while he complains fine-tuning rewards take 10-20 minutes with Isaac Gym, then laughs.\n6. A 3D animation tool shows a humanoid moving as he talks about Atlas, using human motion files, and invites viewers to the next video.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 6.",

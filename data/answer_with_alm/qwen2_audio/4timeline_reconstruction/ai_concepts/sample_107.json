Then, the presenter points at the slide listing Candidate Sourcing, Ranking, and heuristics stages (2), which indicates that this was the previous slide shown before moving on to the current one. After that, the slide switches to Out-of-Network via Social Graph with a node diagram (3), followed by the speaker mentioning that embedding spaces are \"very hot these days\" while showing SimCluster communities (4).\nNext, the video shows a slide with a 48M-parameter neural network ranking 1500 candidates (5), which must have come after explaining the concept of embedding spaces. Following that, the filtering & blending step is described, including avoiding repeats and mixing ads (6). Finally, the video ends with a like/subscribe call and social handles on screen (7).",

The video starts with the presenter outlining the three-stage recommendation setup, then goes on to explain in-network candidate sourcing with Real Graph, followed by out-of-network sourcing via Social Graph and mentioning GraphJet. Then he explains embedding users and tweets into a community space across many interests, before moving on to the Ranking using ML Model slide that introduces the neural network ranker. Finally, he describes filtering and blending to avoid repeats and mix tweets with ads.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

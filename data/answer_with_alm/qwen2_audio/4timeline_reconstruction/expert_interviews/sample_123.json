The screen shows the titles “APOCALYPSIS ORCHESTRA” and “WACKEN WINTER NIGHTS III” while heavy metal plays and the host welcomes the band from Sweden.\n  2. In front of a wall with a “WACHEM REISEN” sign, they say 2018 was all gigs since an album release 18 months earlier and that they’re going back to the studio.\n  3. The interviewee gives a “pessimistic guess” that new work may not arrive until 2020, citing perfectionism.\n  4. With a “WACKEN 2015” banner visible, they discuss their plague theme, mentioning flagellants, the plague doctor mask, and joking “ Bring out your dead.”\n  5. They conclude by saying they plan each gig separately, have many ideas for future gigs, and exchange thanks.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of these moments is:\n\n  1. Discovering Garmarna at age 18, getting hooked, buying a hurdy-gurdy, and the idea to bring folk rock up to metal.\n  2. Combining old folk melodies with modern metal is largely interpretation because ancient music is hard to know precisely.\n  3. Jolly, beer-dance polka/accordion folk metal is contrasted with their darker, more medieval path, joking about Swedish melancholy.\n  4. Melody and arrangement in symbiosis bring out the best, calling their music an ultra-modern interpretation of folk.\n  5. Love for crossover—mixing genres, strange instruments—near a sign reading “WACKY QUINN’S.”\n  6. Norse Edda as an inspiration source, noting its Viking Age roots and calling it more modern from around the 11th century.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

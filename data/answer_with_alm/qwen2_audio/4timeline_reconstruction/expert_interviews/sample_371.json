    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology for help. The events happen in the following order: first a healthcare worker in blue PPE swabs a woman, then a red cross is drawn over a syringe and virus, followed by a discussion on accepting deaths and vaccine escape; a male briefly asks if COVID can be eliminated. Then, there's a mention of Australian and Japanese flags with check marks appearing, along with a claim that elimination is more likely than herd immunity and a warning it could return when borders reopen. Next, a speech bubble shows a world map with transatlantic flight paths as a male says experts told us we'd have to live with COVID. Finally, a balance scale shifts to show a microscope versus an “RIP” tombstone, and a syringe is drawn toward the tombstone as the female argues against 'living with it' and warns about adaptation reducing vaccine effectiveness.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

The events happen in the following order: First, a woman mentions that 12-15% of people who get infected have long COVID, which is based on data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Next, a man says that 1% of school-age children in the UK currently have COVID, seeking confirmation from the woman. Then, a man draws a circle around \"ON ONE DAY\" and mentions that there were millions of children infected with COVID. This is followed by the woman mentioning that half a million children have been confirmed to be infected with COVID. Lastly, the woman lists symptoms of long COVID, which includes chest pain, breathlessness, cough, exhaustion, gut symptoms, and palpitations, and it is displayed on the screen.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

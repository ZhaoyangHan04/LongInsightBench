This happens at the very beginning, so we place that first in the sequence.\n  * Next, he talks about the pattern across different companies, which is shown on the white screen behind him. This happens right after his greeting, so we place that second in the sequence.\n  * Then, he shows the title of the next segment on the laptop, which is called “15 PM Questions.” This happens after he finishes discussing the patterns across companies, so we place that third in the sequence.\n  * After that, he starts talking about measuring product success and mentions a specific question he has prepared. This happens while the question document is visible on the screen, so we place that fourth in the sequence.\n  * Finally, he ends the segment by asking how to form and validate a hypothesis before shipping, mentioning a specific dollar amount increase and saying he shouldn't spoil it too much. This happens after he finishes discussing the question document, so we place that fifth in the sequence.",

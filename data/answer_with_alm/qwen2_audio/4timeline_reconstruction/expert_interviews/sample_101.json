The chronological order of events is as follows: First, Alex Howard appears on-screen and talks about Facebook becoming part of the \"network fabric\" of our lives. Then, a man predicts that by 2015 Facebook will be a series of tabs where you can \"search there\" and \"buy there.\" Next, the blue card declares: \"YOUTH CULTURE will reject the 'mall' of FACEBOOK.\" After that, a male speaker mentions \"a dozen other apps\" and young people \"defecting.\" Subsequently, the blue title card appears: \"2 â€” Facebook will become the DASHBOARD for life.\" Finally, Scott Smith is identified and explains that online capacity will peak and expansion into the offline world is critical. Therefore, the answer is A: 2 -> 6 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 7.",

    "model_answer": "The correct order of the sub-events is: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 6\nOption A is the correct answer. \n\nThe first event is a man speaking about the potential for a service to reach several hundred million users and being replaced by something new. This is followed by a woman from the Science House saying that the future lies in creating small, thriving businesses and that Facebook does not offer many opportunities. This sets the stage for the discussion of entrepreneurship and innovation. \n\nNext, a blue screen appears with a statement about Facebook making groups smarter and potentially leading to a global superorganism. This is followed by Nova Spivack appearing on-screen and discussing the concept of collective consciousness. Finally, a solid blue screen closes the segment with gentle music playing in the background.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events is: a man talking about the potential for growth and replacement, a woman discussing the importance of small businesses, a blue screen discussing the potential for Facebook to enhance group intelligence, Nova Spivack discussing collective consciousness, and the segment closing with music.",

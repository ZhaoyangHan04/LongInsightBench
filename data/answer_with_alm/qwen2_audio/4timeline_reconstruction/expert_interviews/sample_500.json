    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\nThe speech starts with explaining the importance of basic research taking time for societal benefits (option 1). This is followed by a statement about industry's role in uplifting nations and supporting scientific production (option 2). Then, he addresses the need for government support for science and higher education to foster talent (option 3).\nAfter these initial statements, a black screen appears with a question in Spanish (option 4), which translates to 'What can we learn from Chilean scientific development?' This indicates a shift from discussing general principles to a specific example.\nNext, the speaker critiques the excessive work culture in Japan while acknowledging their diligence (option 5). Finally, he proposes a government fellowship system to allow trainees to concentrate solely on research (option 6).\nTherefore, the sequence of events in the audio leads from general observations to a more specific proposal, ending with a critical commentary on another country's culture.",

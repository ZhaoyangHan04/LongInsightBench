The speaker outlines a “logic” framework (leverage, obvious gain, intelligence, common sense) to close more deals.\n  3. The speaker stresses finding the real objection, says he has a method for any objection, asks if the audience wants to learn, and an interested response is heard.\n  4. A woman objects, “I need to think about it,” the speaker poses a hypothetical, and she replies “Yeah.”\n  5. The speaker explains a closer comes after a “no,” gives a partner-consult hypothetical, and a low buzz ends the segment.\n  6. Tyson asks about the source of someone’s certainty, followed by silence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option B: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6.",

The speaker asks about current sales performance and urges practicing, changing approaches, and researching.\n6. He explains belief drives action; to do different, believe different via new information; notes you may go backward and says it “sounded good.”\n7. A “Happy Friday” exchange occurs, one speaker says Fridays are melancholic, there’s a writing sound, then “My question is…”\n8. A “why” question is answered: motivation shifts from revenge/proving people wrong to family, legacy, making those he touches “golden,” and he praises Alex as a “badass leader.”\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> ",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is: (1) The speaker discusses miniature battle formations and refers to a 'heavy sprue' as he describes a 'big block of pikemen'. This indicates that the discussion about miniature figures and their components has already started. (2) Next, the speaker talks about Scott's Dragoons having smaller horses, which seems to be related to the previous topic. This implies that the discussion might have moved on from miniature figures to specific units or aspects of warfare. (3) Then, the on-screen appearance of the 'M4A3E8 Sherman 'Easy Eight' Platoon' along with a mention of a new plastic M4A3E8 tank and a movie-like commander suggests that the discussion has shifted to military vehicles or toy soldiers. (4) As the speakers make a joke about ski troops and winter gear, mentioning adding layers in 'Matlin Wolard Resin', it becomes clear that they are discussing different types of terrain or accessories for miniature models. (5) Finally, the speaker thanks the audience and closes the presentation by mentioning the 'Roll of Honour (At time of recording)', which indicates the end of the presentation. (6) The music starts playing over the credits as the Roll of Honour list expands",

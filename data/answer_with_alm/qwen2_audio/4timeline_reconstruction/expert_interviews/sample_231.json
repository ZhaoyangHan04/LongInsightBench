    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: (2) Upbeat brass music fades as anchor Paul Hollingsworth appears with a Scottish flag behind, introducing Dr. Rockwood and the study. (5) The doctor, in a beige suit with a yellow tie, replies, \"Big day, thanks very much.\" (3) In a close-up, the doctor recalls 1990s recognition of vascular risks like high blood pressure and diabetes. (1) The doctor introduces \"non-traditional\" examples such as sinusitis or fallen arches as combined risks. (4) In a two-shot with a floral arrangement between chairs, he tells the public to maintain health and exercise to lower late-life dementia risk. (6) With the CTV News logo and flags visible, he explains dementia prevalence rising with the aging population.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on TV news for help. The events should be presented in reverse chronological order based on when each event occurred.\n\nThe last event that happened was the interview with the doctor, so we place it at the end (option D). Then, the doctor mentions the study being released later that day in Neurology and online, so we place that event right after the interview (option D).\n\nNext, the interviewer asks about the sample size and time frame of the study, which comes before the media interest. So we place that event in second position (option B).\n\nFinally, the first event is the interviewer asking how the public can access the study, which leads into the doctor mentioning where the study will be published. We place this event third (option A).\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1.",

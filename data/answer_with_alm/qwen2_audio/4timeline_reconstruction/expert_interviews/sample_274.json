Then, there's the split-brain slide with a red arrow on the first bullet, which is interrupted by a ringing sound. After that, the speaker explains the concept of the split brain problem in the cluster. Next, the slide transitions to show the historical context of the NameNode being a single point of failure before Hadoop 2. This is followed by the HDFS HA Architecture diagram. The DataNodes sending block information to both NameNodes to keep them in sync is explained next. Concurrently, dogs bark intermittently as the presenter provides examples of sshfence and shell fencing methods. Finally, there's a closing blue-gradient screen with a message saying thanks and goodbye.",

This is followed by a transition to slide 2, where the speaker discusses the pre-Hadoop 2 single point of failure. Then, slide 3 shows the HDFS NameNode HA Architecture diagram, which comes after slide 2. After that, the speaker moves on to slide 4, where he talks about DataNodes sending block info to both NameNodes simultaneously. A code snippet appears on slide 5, which is related to fencing via dfs.ha.fencing.methods in hdfs-site.xml. Finally, there is a rustling noise and dogs barking as the speaker discusses sshfence using SSH and fuser, and the \"shell\" fencing method, which belong to slide 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5 -> 7.\n\nFirstly, we have the black screen with \"Richard Stallman, Free Software Foundationâ€¦\" and the ringing sound, which indicates that event 1 occurred before event 2. Then, the man in the green shirt starts describing the community being destroyed, and this is followed by his statement about proprietary software and the wind chime. This suggests that events 3 and 4 happened one after the other.\n\nNext, there is a close-up of a laptop with a red-and-white sticker, and a hand gestures about defending freedom. This implies that event 5 occurred after event 4. Finally, we see an illustration with a bull and a penguin in GPL superhero costumes, which indicates that event 6 happened last.\n\nLastly, there is a black screen displaying \"Il Sistema Operativo GNU/Linux,\" and the man saying he announced in 1983 he would develop a free operating system. This implies that event 7 occurred after event 6.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5 -> 7.",

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is B: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6.\n\nThe audio starts with a contrast between pirates and good neighbors sharing software, which is followed by a brief ringing sound. This is then interrupted by a telephone ringing, suggesting a shift to a new topic or conversation.\n\nAfter the telephone ringing, the speaker urges the audience to switch to free software, implying that proprietary software is not desirable. This is followed by a discussion about Microsoft's attempt to patent basic ideas in .Net, which highlights the issue of software patents.\n\nThe sequence continues with a mention of Microsoft designing a new universal file format and the dangers of software patents protecting only large corporations. This is then connected to the European software-patent directive, which was influenced by the Business Software Alliance according to hidden data in a Word file.\n\nFinally, the speaker emphasizes the advantage of having no software patents in Europe, which is followed by the sound of bells ringing and another person embracing him. This suggests a positive conclusion or celebration of the benefits of a software-free environment.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is B: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6.",

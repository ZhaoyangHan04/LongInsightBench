(2) She states audio description is “part and parcel” of accessibility. (1) The interviewer cites his 2016 book title and asks, “What is audio description?” (4) She explains theater audio introductions and how they were adapted to film after testing with blind viewers. (5) She defines audio subtitles as voicing written subtitles in multilingual films. (6) She recounts a blind person not noticing the description due to immersion, concluding good description shouldn’t draw attention to itself.

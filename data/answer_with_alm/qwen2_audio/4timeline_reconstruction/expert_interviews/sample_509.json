    "model_answer": "Option B seems to be the most logical sequence based on the flow of information presented in the audio:\n\n- In option B, the sequence starts with defining SETI and comparing it to biosignatures, which is followed by scenes of satellite dishes indicating the search for narrowband signals. This aligns with the audio where the speaker discusses the concept of technosignatures and their detection through satellite dishes.\n- Next, the speaker addresses the issue of human-made RFI contamination and how it affects astronomical observations, which is mentioned before the discussion of searching for repeating signals.\n- The final two points discuss the importance of extraordinary evidence and the need for coordinated observations across multiple radio telescopes, which seem to be separate ideas that could be discussed after the initial explanation of the search for technosignatures.\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order of events would be: 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is option A: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1.\n\nFirstly, we have upbeat electronic music playing in the background while a crane lifts a large radio telescope during SKA construction. This event likely occurs first.\n\nSecondly, Dr. Ng describes her CNRS work near Paris and mentions that her job is 100% research. The driving electronic instrumental fades away as she begins her speech, and then it returns at the end. This suggests that the music was playing throughout her speech, but it fades out when she starts talking and comes back when she finishes.\n\nThirdly, there is no background music, and Dr. Ng calls SKA the best instrument and shows an Earth animation with global links. This event occurs next.\n\nLastly, ambient slow electronic music underlies her accepting in 2022 to co-chair Cradle of Life and joining SEAC in 2023. The music continues until the end of the video, where the black screen appears with the group's objectives.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events is: (1) Upbeat electronic music plays as a crane lifts a large radio telescope during SKA construction, (2) Dr. Ng describes her CNRS work near Paris",

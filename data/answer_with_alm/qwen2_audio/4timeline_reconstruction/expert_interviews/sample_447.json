The speaker returns saying “I'm ready,” misnames “Microsoft Java,” then corrects to “C#.”\n  3. With a white Microsoft mug by the bright monitor, a second voice corrects “decades ago” to “one decade ago,” claiming C# has “always been” cross-platform since 2016.\n  4. A blue “IN DEPTH” box and a digital clock reading 10:01 are visible as the breathless list of .NET variants hits “.NET Five,” ending with a sigh.\n  5. Holding a Microsoft mug, the talk “not sponsored by Microsoft” is cut off by a loud crash; he resumes to mention “HoloLens.”\n\nTherefore, the answer is option A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

A short synthesized tone plays just before he starts talking about C# features.\n  3. There is a sudden loud noise, and he makes a joke about the quality of the chair being from Microsoft, which has a blue \"C# 7.0\" box on it.\n  4. Another person chimes in and mentions that they really like the new nullability operator.\n  5. He goes on to talk about various programming languages and frameworks such as Windows Forms, WebForms, MVC, Silverlight, WPF, and UWP, and then mentions Xamarin Forms for cross-platform development.\n  6. Finally, he mentions that they are restoring packages and targeting .NET 6 in Visual Studio, but there are 24 errors, so they need to take a break.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

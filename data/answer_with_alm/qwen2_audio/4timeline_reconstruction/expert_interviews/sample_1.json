    "model_answer": "The correct sequence of events is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\nOption A is the correct answer. \n\nThe audio starts with a person advising to contact a solicitor early, which is event 1. Then, it moves on to discussing steps before buying or selling, such as getting a mortgage (event 2). This is followed by explaining the advantages of using a local solicitor (event 3), with some outdoor background noise. After that, a \"THANK YOU\" card is visible while the speaker clarifies that conveyancing is usually on fixed fees (event 4). Next, the discussion emphasizes choosing based on expertise and trust rather than price, with a surgery analogy and frustration about unavailable solicitors (event 5). Finally, a white screen with the text \"Property video presentations\" appears (event 6).\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6, making option A the correct answer.",

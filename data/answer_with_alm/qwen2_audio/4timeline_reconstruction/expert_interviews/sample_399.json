Cohen to talk about his area of expertise. Then, there's a transition to a slide showing \"Mobile Medical Apps,\" followed by a comment on \"wordsmithing.\" After these interjections, the male speaker starts discussing the regulation of mobile medical apps.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

    "model_answer": "Option B seems like the most likely answer based on the visual elements and chronological sequence present in the audio. Here's the reasoning:\n\nThe audio starts with a slide titled \"General Wellness Products,\" which indicates that event 1 occurred first. Afterward, we hear a male speaking about FDA guidance and the carve-out for low-risk wellness devices. This suggests that event 2 happened next.\n\nIn event 3, the male makes a joke about being a new parent while discussing a sleep tracker that doesn't work well. This is followed by the closing black screen with \"thank you for watching\" and social media icons, indicating that event 3 concluded the video.\n\nEvent 4 occurs when the female asks if AI accuracy problems bleed into popular wearables. This is followed by the male predicting more litigation related to this issue. This implies that events 4 and 5 happened consecutively.\n\nFinally, event 6 takes place when the female asks if there's anything on the horizon at the federal level regarding the intersection of technology and wellness. This is followed by the male cautioning against unsupported claims. This suggests that event 6 occurred last.\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order of the sub-events is option B: 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> ",

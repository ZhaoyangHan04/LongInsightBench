This is followed by somber classical music playing and her beginning to introduce herself, suggesting that event 4 happened next.\nAfter that, she asserts that \"science is not science unless it is public,\" and a door slamming sound is heard right after, indicating that event 3 took place.\nFinally, she mentions receiving the President's Medal of Science in 1999 from President Clinton, and shows a colorful cell image labeled \"cytokinesis of spermatogonia, by hypothesis.\" This implies that event 5 occurred last, followed by her explaining how they are reconstructing what destroyed the buildings on 9/11, with the label reading \"cytokinesis of spermatogonia, by hypothesis.\"\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\n\nExplanation:\nEvent 2 occurs first because it introduces the topic of the video and the argument being made. Event 1 follows next, as it provides context about the material evidence mentioned in event 2. Event 3 builds upon event 1 by criticizing the lack of evidence presented in event 2. Event 4 describes a specific action taken during the investigation that supports event 3's criticism. Finally, event 5 summarizes the main points discussed in the video and ties together the events leading up to the final statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

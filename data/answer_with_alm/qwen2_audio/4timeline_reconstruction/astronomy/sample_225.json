    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on public relations for help. The speech starts with a question about the solar system, leading into a discussion about science fiction stories. Then it transitions to real-life scientists like Kepler who contributed to our understanding of the solar system. After that, images related to the topic are displayed, complementing the speaker's narrative. Finally, a bullet-point list is presented on the slide, providing additional context on the subject matter.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8.\n\nThe first event discussed is the instability of the early solar system, which leads to the formation of planets. This is followed by the migration of Jupiter into the inner solar system, which has been observed through the \"Planet Migration & Scattering\" graph. \n\nNeptune's subsequent formation and migration outward is then explained, which led to the Kuiper Belt being pushed further out. The \"hot Jupiter\" very close to its star is mentioned as an example of a type of exoplanet that has been discovered.\n\nThe concept of history and artifacts is introduced with the appearance of the \"HISTORY\" red banner and the definition about artifacts and models for our past. The \"orbital arrangements and chemical composition\" of the solar system is then explained, leading to the discovery of nearby young planetary systems.\n\nFinally, the speaker mentions how Mars captured an asteroid and Jupiter ripped apart comets, indicating that long-term stability is necessary when looking for life beyond our planet.",

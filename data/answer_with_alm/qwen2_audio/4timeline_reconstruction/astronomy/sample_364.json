Then, a slide appears that shows the asteroid belt, Kuiper Belt, and Oort Cloud diagram with distances in AU (Option 2).\nAfterward, the speaker mentions that Pluto was the first Kuiper Belt object (Option 3), which leads into a discussion about the Oort Cloud (Option 4), a third region where small bodies live (Option 5). Finally, the speaker talks about comets in the Oort Cloud and the role of smaller bodies in the solar system's history (Option 6).\nThe white credits screen appears at the end of the video with the logo and the phrase \"What does our cosmic neighbourhood look like?\" (Option 6).",

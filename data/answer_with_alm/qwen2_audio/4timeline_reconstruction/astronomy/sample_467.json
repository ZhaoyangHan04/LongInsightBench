(3) The presenter stands in front of an ancient Egyptian wall carving. (1) A large solar system diagram appears, and the presenter points to planetary orbits. (5) The background switches to an ancient wall relief with figures. (6) A colorful mural with figures, trees, and flags becomes the backdrop.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option C.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order would be option A: 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 6 -> 7.\nFirstly, the speaker mentions a scientist with 30 years of research and a physicist's study, which implies that these events occurred recently. This is followed by a close-up of a solar system diagram, indicating that the discussion was about the solar system.\nNext, the speaker refers to Immanuel Velikovsky’s idea of Venus devastating Mars and nearly Earth, which suggests that this event took place before the close-up of the solar system diagram.\nThe mural with figures and trees is then shown, which could be related to the discussion but does not provide a clear chronological order.\nThe speaker then talks about Zechariah Sitchin’s Nibiru and a moon collision forming the asteroid belt, which seems to be a separate topic from the previous ones.\nFinally, the speaker mentions Jupiter entering the solar system around 7,000 years ago and devastating Mars, which implies that this event occurred after the other events mentioned.\nLastly, he links Venus to legends of the Great Flood and a 10,000-foot tidal wave, which also seems to be a separate topic from the previous ones.\nTherefore,",

    "model_answer": "Option B seems like the most likely order based on the flow of narration and visual elements presented in the video.\n\nThe video starts with an academic narrator discussing \"bursty star formation,\" which is related to supercomputing simulations. This is followed by a montage showcasing JWST's achievements on its second anniversary, including images of space technology. \n\nNext, the narrator mentions the detection of a massive early collision, which is accompanied by images of colliding galaxies. This is then followed by a shot of Mace's galaxy, which is mentioned as being around 390 million years old. \n\nThe narrator then discusses how the telescope will continue its operations for another decade or two, which is shown through colorful nebula visuals. Finally, there is a calm voice saying that early galaxies puzzle scientists, which is followed by a shot of three satellite dishes aiming towards the sky.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events in the video is: 2 -> 6 -> 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 5 -> 4.",

    "model_answer": "Option B seems like the most likely order based on the flow of events described in the video. Here's why:\n\n- Option B starts with event 5, which mentions a gold-mirrored space telescope showing a massive galaxy collision. This is followed by event 2, which references the standard model and a black hole vortex called \"El Gordo.\" This makes sense because the El Gordo black hole is associated with a massive galaxy collision.\n- Event 7 comes next, which discusses ancient galaxies producing fewer heavy elements than predicted. This is related to event 1, where the narrator identifies a fourth major challenge about missing heavy elements in ancient galaxies.\n- Events 4 and 8 follow each other, with event 4 discussing an early collision between two massive clusters and event 8 mentioning extremely early galaxies forming a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. These events are related to each other because both involve the formation of large-scale structures in the universe.\n- Event 6 comes next, which talks about behemoth black holes in young galaxies with \"cyclones.\" This is related to event 3, where the narrator urges us to embrace the unknown as a comet streaks by.\n- Finally, event 3 ends the sequence by summarizing the main points of the",

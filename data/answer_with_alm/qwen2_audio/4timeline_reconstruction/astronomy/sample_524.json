    "model_answer": "The correct chronology of events is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.\nFirstly, we have the Eagle News intro with an eagle and nebula, which sets the scene and builds suspense. Then, the narrator introduces the hidden planet \"Nibiru,\" which is the starting point for the rest of the video's content.\nNext, we see a Wikipedia page about the Nibiru cataclysm, which adds credibility to the existence of Nibiru. This is followed by a starry countdown card showing \"6,\" which indicates that the narrator is about to introduce the next topic, which is Planet X and its orbit irregularities.\nFinally, we see NASA/Caltech Planet Nine visuals, which confirm the existence of Planet Nine. The video ends with a like/subscribe end screen, where the narrator acknowledges the false information about Nibiru.\nTherefore, the correct order of events is: Introduction to Nibiru -> Evidence for Nibiru -> Discussion of Planet X -> Confirmation of Planet Nine -> Conclusion.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronology of events in the audio is:\n\n1. A collage appears as the narrator introduces Carlos Muñoz Ferrada and correlates astronomical phenomena with earthquakes.\n2. A black-and-white man on the phone is shown while the narrator details Ferrada’s 1939 prediction accuracy and the death toll.\n3. The same man on the phone appears again, then a newspaper titled “Possibly as Large as Jupiter Mystery Heavenly Body Discovered” is shown as the narrator claims Nibiru will be visible as a “second sun.”\n4. A dramatic Earth-from-space shot followed by an incoming comet/asteroid appears as the narrator introduces “cataclysms on Earth” as the third topic.\n5. A diagram labeled with Tiamat’s paths and orbits is shown as the narrator describes Nibiru’s retrograde strike on Tiamat and asks, “Right?”\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is option A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

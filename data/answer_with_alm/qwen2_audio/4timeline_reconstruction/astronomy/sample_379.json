    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5. \n\nThe first event is a white title card showing “KAIRA Kilpisjärvi Atmospheric Imaging Receiver Array,” which indicates the beginning of the discussion about EISCAT. This is followed by an eerie high-pitched synth tone, adding a sense of mystery or foreboding to the scene.\n\nA second male voice then explains that EISCAT runs incoherent scatter radars to measure the ionosphere where the aurora occurs. This provides background information on the topic being discussed.\n\nA map then marks Tromsø, Kiruna, and Sodankylä, and a speaker describes a unique tristatic radar that measures 3D vector velocities. This introduces the concept of EISCAT 3D and its capabilities.\n\nFinally, a speaker contrasts phased arrays with dish antennas as snowy wind turbines are shown. This brings the discussion full circle, tying together the different aspects of EISCAT and its use in scientific research.\n\nTherefore, the events in option B follow a logical sequence that covers the introduction of the topic, background information, technical details, and practical applications.",

    "model_answer": "The correct order is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7. \n\nThe first event is the speaker highlighting key locations on a map, which sets the geographical context for the discussion. This is followed by a presentation on the EISCAT-University of Oulu partnership for EISCAT 3D, which provides technical background information. The third event involves a flowchart explaining the use of a radio receiver for data processing, which is relevant to the subsequent discussion of scientific measurements. The fourth event shows the aurora borealis being observed through a camera, which adds a visual element to the presentation. The fifth event introduces the concept of riometry for measuring ionospheric opacity, which is related to the scientific measurements discussed earlier. The sixth event features a large radio telescope at sunset, which suggests that the presentation is taking place outdoors. Finally, the seventh event displays a slide with KAIRA and sponsor logos, indicating that the presentation may be sponsored by a company or organization associated with the project.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option A: 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4.\nFirstly, Bob makes a comment about Saturn's opposition, which indicates that he is outside and preparing for a planetary session. Then, he explains the process of collimating, which involves adjusting the OTA (optical tube assembly). This leads into a discussion about a sponsor message from High Point Scientific and advice for backyard astronomers. Finally, after closing up the OTA, Bob checks the focus on the laptop and confirms that it's still out of focus, leading him to head outside and continue his observations under the stars.",

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence of events is: \nFirst, he adjusts a Bob's Knob while the star moves (event 1), which is indicated by the on-screen message \" TURNING COLLIMINATION SCREW.\" This is followed by him demonstrating schlieren imaging (event 2). Then, he centers the Bahtinov mask's middle beam and confirms that he's ready to image Saturn (event 3). After that, he grabs a beer from the fridge (event 4), mentioning that it's time for beer. Next, he processes Saturn in AutoStakkert and reveals the final labeled image (event 5). Finally, he signs off with thanks and an existential remark as the starry sky appears (event 6). Therefore, the correct sequence is option A: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5.",

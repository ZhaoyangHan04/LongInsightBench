    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: 2 -> 3 -> 6 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5\nExplanation: In the beginning, the person mentions that they have removed the finder and the mount. Then, they adjust the mount to fine-tune the altitude and azimutum adjustments. After that, they mention that the telescope tube is no longer balanced properly. This implies that they had already adjusted the mount earlier. Next, they weigh the removed items on a digital scale and state the total weight reduction. Finally, they outline their plan to relocate the cables and electronics to balance weight and reduce leverage. Therefore, the order of events is: remove the finder and mount, adjust the mount, notice the imbalance, weigh the removed items, and outline the relocation plan.",

    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 6\nExplanation: In the video, the person first mentions connecting the electronics boxes to a Vixen dovetail using 3D-printed clamps, followed by opening a beige dew heater controller and explaining PWM via a potentiometer. Then, he describes an eight-port USB3 hub and a power distribution box splitting a 12V 30A feed into five. Next, he opens a black relay/Arduino box and complains about the brightness of the indicator LEDs, wanting to change resistors. After that, he shows a multimeter reading 4.76 while discussing changing resistor values on the relay board. Finally, he mentions that he measured the needed power-cable lengths, cut and re-soldered them, and sorted/ordered shorter USB cables. Therefore, the sequence of events is 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 6.",

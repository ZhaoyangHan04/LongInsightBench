    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n1. The speaker starts by discussing the winter solstice and how it relates to Sankranti customs and the start of Uttarayan.\n2. Next, the speaker refers to a table showing the Sun's entry into Capricornus over a period from 2001 to 2008, noting that this occurs after sunset on January 14th.\n3. This leads to a discussion about the time at which the Sun enters Capricorn and the rules for celebrating the event.\n4. The speaker then explains the reason for the forward shift in the timing of the event due to the Gregorian calendar and accumulated surplus time.\n5. Finally, the speaker discusses the effects of these changes on the years 2009-2012 and speculates about a future pattern change.\n6. The speaker concludes by urging viewers to share the video and wishing them good luck in their endeavors, followed by credits rolling and background music.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \nFirstly, the narrator explains the circular card mask shades the screen and stops the finderscope receiving direct sunlight (Option 1). Then, the narrator displays a blue slide showing \"PROJECTION\" in white capitals (Option 2). Thirdly, the narrator advises that in an emergency you should shift the telescope away from the Sun and mentions a foam-board projection box (Option 3). Fourthly, over the outdoor setup, the narrator describes a simple 1999 eclipse projection system using paper, plywood, aluminum angle, and a pipe clip (Option 4). Finally, the narrator cautions that someone might try to look into the eyepiece and says a responsible, vigilant person must oversee the setup (Option 5).\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3. Option B is the closest match.",

This is then followed by the warning against using enclosed catadioptric scopes for solar projection and the placement of the filter on the big end (option 5).\n\nFinally, the narrator emphasizes the importance of never using eyepiece solar filters and mentions a companion video (option 6), which leads us to the last item on the list - the closing blue slide listing five safety rules, including \"Cap your finderscope!\" (option 3).",

This is followed by an energetic rock song playing over an animated intro (option 1). Then, there is a woman reading out the definition of a lightyear (option 3), accompanied by a steady ambient hum.\nAfter the hosts say goodbye, the energetic rock music returns (option 4), and the video cuts to an image labeled \"Mars\" as a male explains scientific notation and says to multiply by one light year (option 6).\nFinally, a male voice states that Mars is the fourth planet in our solar system, with its namesake and distance (option 5). He also mentions that Mars is about 11/100th the mass of Earth and is called the second smallest planet (option 7). This sequence ends with the video showing the host holding a paper and gesturing (option 8).",

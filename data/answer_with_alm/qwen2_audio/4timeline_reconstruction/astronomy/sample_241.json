A weather.gov hourly forecast (then Enoch text) is on screen while the speaker states that on the 18th the sun rose at 5:04 and the moon at 5:01, quoting verse seven.\n4. The display switches between weather tables and a calendar set to June 18 as he analyzes the sun and moon setting together and discusses the light portion.\n5. A moon-tracking app shows a 0.7% illuminated waxing crescent while the speaker stresses the sacred calendar stakes and asks for prayers for travel to DC.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.",

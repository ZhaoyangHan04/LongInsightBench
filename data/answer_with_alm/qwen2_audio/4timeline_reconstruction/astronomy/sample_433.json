    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is option B: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5.\n\nFirstly, the title 'Different Types of Supernova' appears on the screen, indicating that the speaker will start explaining different types of supernovae. This event happens before the speaker mentions anything about the dwarf or the explosion.\n\nNext, the speaker says 'the star goes boom' and asks how big the boom is, which implies that the explosion has already occurred. This event comes after the title 'Different Types of Supernova' but before the speaker starts explaining the difference between Type I and Type II supernovae.\n\nAfterwards, the text states 'Type I = Less Hydrogen; Type II = More Hydrogen,' which provides additional context about the explosion. This event happens after the speaker has mentioned the explosion and before they have started explaining the different types of supernovae.\n\nFinally, the slides ask 'But What's Left?' and show nebulae as star remnants. This event comes last in the sequence, after the speaker has explained the different types of supernovae and their properties.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5",

The male instructor first introduces Helioviewer.org, suggesting a tutorial, which leads into the view zooming in on the sun. Then, the interface showing options for different solar images is presented, followed by the discussion about the spacecraft that provides the imagery (SDO). As the sliders are adjusted, the female speaker identifies AIA as the imager and notes HMI is magnetic data they will not focus on. Finally, the speaker explains Angstrom units and demonstrates how the cursor can be used to zoom in and adjust brightness/contrast controls, leading to the final view of the yellow photosphere with sunspots and a brown/orange EUV corona.",

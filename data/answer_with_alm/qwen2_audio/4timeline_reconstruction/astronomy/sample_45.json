This indicates that this event comes first in the sequence.\nNext, the graph with a diagonal trend and a citation is shown, explaining dispersion in plasma makes lower frequencies arrive later (Option 3). This implies that this event follows the mention of fast radio bursts.\nAfterwards, the screen switches to a satellite dish in a green field while he recounts the 2001 Parkes detection and local microwave(car) interference (Option 4). This event comes next in the sequence.\nFinally, pointing at the graph, he says the narrow spike arrives earlier at high frequency and later at low (Option 5). This implies that this event follows the mention of local microwave(car) interference.\nTherefore, the correct order is 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3.",

Then, there is a discussion about coherent emission and a neutron star, suggesting events 2 and 6 happened next. After that, the graph is mentioned, which indicates event 5 took place. Finally, the star system image reappears with some bursts repeating, leading up to event 3.",

    "model_answer": "The correct order is: 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6 -> 1\nOption A is the correct answer. Here's why:\n\n- Option A starts with the definition of a black hole, which is essential knowledge for understanding the rest of the events described in the video.\n- Then comes the title card \"The Effects on Earth,\" which sets the context for the discussion about the impact of a black hole on our planet.\n- Next, the speaker explains that Earth wouldn't be affected by the black hole's gravitational pull because it's at a similar distance from the Sun.\n- After this, the narrator mentions the size difference between the Sun and a black hole, which is relevant to understanding the potential consequences of replacing the Sun with a black hole.\n- Finally, the narration warns about the loss of light and heat if the Sun were to disappear, which ties back to the main topic of the video.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events in the video is best represented by option A.",

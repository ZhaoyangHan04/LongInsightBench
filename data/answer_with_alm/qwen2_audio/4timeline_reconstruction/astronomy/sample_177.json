    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the moments is option B: 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6.\nOption B best fits the sequence of events based on the content described in the audio segment:\n\n  * Option B starts with the mention of a starry graphic and a zodiac chart, which likely occurs first due to its visual nature.\n  * This is followed by a discussion about the Surya Siddhanta being updated in 580 AD, which provides context for the next event.\n  * Next, there is a mention of the Precession causing rapid change, which builds upon the topic of celestial motion introduced earlier.\n  * The night sky diagram with Polaris, Vega, and Denab is then displayed, which further supports the idea of celestial motion and helps establish the time frame for the remaining events.\n  * Finally, the speaker refers to the original composition of the Surya Siddhanta and the latest update, providing closure to the sequence of events.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of the moments is 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6.",

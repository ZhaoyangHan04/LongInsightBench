    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on history for help. The speaker first makes a comment about the possibility that Indian astronomy dates back to 5000 BC, which is when the gentle background music starts. Then a graph comparing Greek and Indian solar errors is presented, after which the speaker notes that the Indian method is twice as accurate. Next, the presenter mentions that the pulsating epicycle was developed between 8000 BC and 3000 BC, which is followed by a graph showing the solar error over time from 10000 BC to 2000 AD. Therefore, the correct chronological order is 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

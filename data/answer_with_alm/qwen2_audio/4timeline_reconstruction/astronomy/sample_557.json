    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4.\n\nThe first event is when the speaker mentions the Orion Nebula, which leads us to believe that event 1 comes before event 2. Event 3 describes the appearance of a dark channel under the Milky Way, which is followed by event 5 where the speaker refers to this same area as the beginning of a star's life. This indicates that event 3 happens before event 5. Finally, event 4 is when a female voice joins over a vibrant nebula, completing the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the order of events is: a desert silhouette under the Milky Way appears (event 1), followed by the mention of the Orion Nebula (event 2), then the appearance of a dark channel under the Milky Way (event 3), leading to the reference of this area as the beginning of a star's life (event 5), and concluding with the observatory dome appearing (event 6).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is option D: 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> 6.\n\nFirstly, event 2 mentions a fiery sphere with the UK Astrophysical Fluids Facility label, which indicates that this event comes first. This is followed by event 4 where simulations are discussed, implying that this event occurs next.\n\nEvent 3 refers to material being squirted out along with a disc, which likely occurred after the previous events. Event 1 describes large-scale jets and compares them to a Goya painting, which suggests that this event comes after event 2.\n\nEvent 5 discusses the formation of stars too fast and efficiently, which implies that this event follows event 4. Finally, event 6 shows a timeline simulation with on-screen Myr timestamps, which indicates that this event comes last.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n1. The speaker starts by stating that there are two reasons why Polaris doesn't move exactly in the same place - stars orbit the galaxy and have their own motion.\n2. This is followed by an animation showing the Earth with a grid and a red arrow at the North Pole, which helps explain precession and the axial tilt.\n3. Next, we see a telescope under a starry sky with a red light, which is used to show how star trackers work, along with polar alignment and the fact that Polaris isn't always at the celestial pole.\n4. After this, the speaker emphasizes that simply pointing at Polaris isn't sufficient because it's not exactly at the celestial pole.\n5. We then see a close-up of a polar scope reticle with a crosshair and rings labeled with years, which shows how the rings on the reticle can be used to find Polaris even if it's not at the celestial pole.\n6. Next, a smartphone compass app screen is displayed, which shows how apps can use position and time to find the correct spot for Polaris.\n7. Finally, space images of a nebula, a spiral galaxy, and a planetary nebula appear, which help emphasize the importance",

The speaker starts by explaining why Polaris doesn't move, hesitates, then transitions into discussing the Milky Way and its stars. This is followed by a demonstration of the Earth's axial tilt and how it affects seasonal changes. The video then shows a graphic comparing solstices and equinoxes, and finally, it ends with a discussion of seasonal constellations and the difference between a solar day and a sidereal day.",

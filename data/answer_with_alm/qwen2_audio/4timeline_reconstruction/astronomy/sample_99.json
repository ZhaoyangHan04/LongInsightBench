Then, the speaker introduces brown dwarfs using Orion Nebula images (option 3). Afterward, he mentions the Sun's distance from Earth (option 4) and shows a binary revolution diagram (option 4). Another speaker then promotes the playlist and asks viewers to subscribe (option 5). The lecture continues with a discussion on the closest stars (option 6), followed by a description of the white dwarf Sirius B (option 7). Finally, the lecture ends with the speaker saying that it's been a cool L-dwarf visual binary that rotates over time (option 8), and the slide changes to show dated red dots (option 8).",

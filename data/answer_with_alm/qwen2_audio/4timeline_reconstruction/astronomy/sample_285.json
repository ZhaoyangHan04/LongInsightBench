    "model_answer": "Answer: D: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5\n\nThe sequence starts with option 2, where the male speaker asks the question about the brightest star in Earth's sky. This leads to option 1, where he highlights Sirius on a star map and mentions its magnitude. Then, option 3 comes in, where the speaker directly answers that the sun is the brightest star. After this, option 4 provides context about the title of the video, which involves the pistol star and nebula observed by the Hubble Space Telescope. \n\nOption 5 reveals that the pistol star was discovered in 1990, shortly after the Hubble's launch, which is followed by a sound effect. Finally, option 6 refers to observations made in 1995 and 1996 in relation to star clusters near the center of the galaxy. Overall, the sequence seems to be chronological as it follows the events related to the brightest star, the sun, the discovery of the pistol star, and observations of star clusters.",

    "model_answer": "Option B seems like the most likely answer based on the sequence of events described in the subtitle text provided. Here's why:\n\n- The first event mentioned is the display of a blue nebula with arrows pointing to \"Pistol Star\" and \"The Sun,\" which suggests that the video starts with a visual representation of the universe and mentions two key celestial objects.\n- Next, there is a discussion about a red-tinted view highlighting a central star, which seems to be related to the previous event and may be part of the same scene.\n- The third event involves a black-and-white nebula image with a yellow label \"PISTOL STAR,\" which provides additional context about the central star discussed earlier.\n- The fourth event mentions the star being \"destined for certain death in a brilliant supernova,\" which implies that the video is discussing the end stages of a star's life.\n- The fifth event features a different male voice discussing massive stars and their atmospheres, which seems to be a separate topic from the previous events.\n- Finally, the sixth event mentions observations of the Milky Way and infrared images, which again seems to be a separate topic from the previous events.\n\nTherefore, option B seems like the most logical order of events based on the subtitle text provided.",

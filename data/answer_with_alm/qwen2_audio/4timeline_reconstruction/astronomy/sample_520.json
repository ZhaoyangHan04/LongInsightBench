This is followed by the description of the late 2017 discovery of a \"long narrow slab of rock\" passing through. A diagram then appears on screen to illustrate Neptune's orbit, the Kuiper belt, and the Oort cloud. The narrator provides an explanation about these objects and their significance. After this, the heading \"WHY IT MATTERS\" appears with an explanation about how these objects reveal chemical makeup and formation clues. The narrator then asks \"What's next?\", which is followed by a burst of electronic music. The speaker then outlines the limitations of the James Webb Space Telescope in revealing the Oort Cloud. Finally, the narrator mentions surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Vera Rubin Observatory to find more comets. The video ends with interlocking gears and a \"Thanks for watching. Donations are always welcome.\" message.",

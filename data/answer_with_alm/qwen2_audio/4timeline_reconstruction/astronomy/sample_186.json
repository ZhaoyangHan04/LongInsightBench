    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is option B: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5.\nThe sequence starts with Slide 3 explaining that we always see the same side of the moon because it's tidally locked with Earth. This leads to Slide 2 where the speaker points out that the Moon's rotation period is the same as its orbit period, which is 27.3 days. This is followed by Slide 1 where the speaker asks why they are the same.\nSlide 4 then explains how Earth's gravity raises a bulge and slows the Moon's spin, making it tidally locked. Finally, Slide 5 concludes that we can see about 59% of the Moon's surface at any given time, with the rest requiring spacecraft to observe. The clip ends with someone saying \"Lily,\" which may be a reference to the image shown in Slide 3 or simply a random word.",

This is then followed by a scene about studying a star's death (5).\n- Option A has the second scene out of order, putting the exoplanet discovery before the black hole discovery.\n- Option C has the exoplanet discovery after the black hole discovery, which is incorrect.\n- Option D has the exoplanet discovery after the second black hole discovery, which is also incorrect.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option B: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.\nThe first event mentioned is the appearance of the title card, which indicates that the narrator is starting a new episode. This is followed by a visual display of a deep blue cosmic web, which likely corresponds to the second moment mentioned. The third moment involves a discussion about the impact of Hubble's discoveries on astronomy, which would be followed by a credit roll showing the partners involved in the Hubble program. Finally, the last two moments involve interviews with experts, with one discussing the future of astronomy and the other describing the European Southern Observatory and its telescopes.",

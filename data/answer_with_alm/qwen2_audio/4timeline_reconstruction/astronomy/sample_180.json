This happens at the beginning of the video. \n\nNext, a nebula image from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope appears on the screen while the speaker mentions picking a favorite blank patch of sky and pointing Hubble at it. This happens after the title slide but before the Royal Society of Victoria logo appears on the screen.\n\nAfter that, the Royal Society of Victoria logo appears on the screen while the speaker talks about human curiosity, \"boundaries,\" and \"discovery.\" This occurs before the presenter gestures at cosmic images and mentions dark matter clumping collapsing and dragging gas into a forming halo.\n\nFinally, the purple nebula from the Dark project appears on the screen as the speaker explains dark matter clumps collapsing and dragging gas into a forming halo. This happens last in the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.",

Then, he displays a colorful galaxy image titled “Self-annihilation signals” (Option 2), which likely leads him to discuss the topic further. This is followed by a fiery image with “No.” on top as he mentions the Milky Way's central black hole and pulsars emitting gamma radiation (Option 3).\nNext, the speaker shows a slide labeled “Direct Detection” that demonstrates the Milky Way/solar system and how a dark matter wind can be detected (Option 4). This is followed by a display of a sodium iodide crystal detector, which glows more when moving with the sun (Option 5). Finally, split views of Stawell and a SUPL poster appear as he announces that they are excavating 1024 m underground and plan to place the detector there next year (Option 6).",

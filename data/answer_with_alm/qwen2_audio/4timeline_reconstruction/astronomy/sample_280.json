This occurs at the beginning of the video, making option A the correct answer.\n2. Next, the speaker talks about the importance of water on the moon and how it could have arrived there through various means, such as comets and volcanic outgassing.

In the third step, the speaker shows a cross-section of the moon's interior, revealing a glowing core and discussing the possibility of water being locked in the mantle and in a thick watery atmosphere due to volcanic activity. This happens after the initial discussion about water on the moon, making option B the correct answer.\n4. Afterward, the narrator confirms that water exists almost everywhere, including on the moon, and mentions lunar ice and a possible gasp in response to this discovery. This happens later in the video, making option C the correct answer.\n5. Finally, turquoise text appears on the screen, stating that each of these events lasts about 100 million years.

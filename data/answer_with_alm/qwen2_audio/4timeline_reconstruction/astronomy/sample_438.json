After that, the audience sees the Hubble Space Telescope slide, which corresponds to the speaker's discussion of its 1993 operation. Next, the speaker takes them on a tour through time by identifying the prime meridian at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. This leads into the discussion of the Earth's tilt and the resulting seasons. The slide showing the sun's low winter angle is presented, followed by a demonstration using a Foucault pendulum.

Then, the speaker refers to the ancient Mayan observatory El Caracol (slide number 3), which is related to the topic of days around the year 1000. After that, the classic eight-phase Moon diagram is presented for a module two lab (slide number 4), and there is a page-turn sound indicating a transition. Next, the speaker discusses eclipse geometry slides (slide number 5) and mentions an upcoming eclipse, referencing the 2017 path. Lastly, a person in a maroon \"Missouri\" hoodie promotes watching more videos and subscribing (slide number 6).\nTherefore, the sequence of the slides is consistent with the chronological order of events described in the audio.",

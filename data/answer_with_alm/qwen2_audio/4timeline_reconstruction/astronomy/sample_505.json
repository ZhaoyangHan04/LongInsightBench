    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option A: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6.\nThe first event mentioned is the appearance of a cross-sectional view of Jupiter's core, which happens early on in the video. This is followed by a discussion of Jupiter's size, composition, and internal structure.\nNext, the narrator talks about Jupiter's storms, including the Great Red Spot, and mentions that its day length is just under 10 hours. This event comes before the discussion of the Great Red Spot's history and depth.\nAfter that, the female voice provides details about the Great Red Spot's history and depth, while dramatic music starts playing. This event happens before the discussion of Jupiter's magnetic field strength and comparison with Earth's.\nFinally, the speaker talks about future missions to Jupiter, such as NASA's Europa Clipper and ESA's Juice. This event comes after the discussion of Jupiter's magnetic field and before the closing statement about the planet continuing to amaze and inspire us.\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6.",

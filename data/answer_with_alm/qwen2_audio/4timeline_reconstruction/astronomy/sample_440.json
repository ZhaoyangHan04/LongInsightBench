    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: Glenn invites viewers to join him setting up the garden and names his channel \"Astro Boke.\" (1) Then, ambient electronic music starts as the visuals cut to a colorful nebula. (2) In the backyard, he says he likes the \"cam 26\" but wishes his tripod were sturdier. (3) Indoors at the PC, he says the Stellarium link in NINA wasn't working and he manually entered coordinates. (4) Lastly, he says early frames were \"photobombed by Elon Musk\" with satellites and that he is taking 90-second subs to stack. Therefore, the correct order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5. The answer is A.",

    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: \n1. He says he needs to \"join the party\" imaging the green comet, with on-screen text C/2022 E3 (ZTF). \n2. He outlines his plan to shoot RGB using the CEM 26 mount, Z61, and 2600mm pro camera. \n3. Outside, he calls polar alignment \"a bit awkward\" and says the locks cause movement when tightened. \n4. He reports guiding was 0.9â€“1.2 but improved to ~0.6 after PEC training. \n5. Still outside, he dislikes plugging into a handset, mentions possible Wi-Fi control, and praises how quiet the mount is. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

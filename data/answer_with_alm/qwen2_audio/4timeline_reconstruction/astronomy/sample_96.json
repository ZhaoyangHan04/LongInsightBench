The sequence starts with setting up the equipment on the deck (option 2), followed by optimizing options for planetary images (option 6). Then, he captures an image of Jupiter and Saturn (option 1), which is then merged with another image in Photoshop (option 3). After that, he aligns the frames and stacks them using AutoStakkert and RegiStax (options 4 and 5). Finally, he checks for any shaky objects in the captured images (option 7) and processes the images using PIPP (option 8).",

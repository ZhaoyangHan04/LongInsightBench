Then he begins explaining the guide-camera setup. Next, on the PHD2 Guiding screen, he enables the server to accept dither commands. After that, in Nebulosity, he uses the PHD Link to send a dither and move the telescope, which is accompanied by a loud mechanical whirr. Finally, in Sequence Generator Pro, he sets up Auto Guide to use Medium Dither every frame via PHD2.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7\nOption A is the correct answer. The video starts with the speaker opening PHD2 Log Viewer, joking about the developer being \"unidentified,\" and showing guide logs. This is followed by a loud noise interrupting his speech and him noting that it's a full moon. In Photoshop, he adds the text \"SUBSCRIBE TO PEWDIEPIE\" and demonstrates simulated dithering to reveal a hidden message after stacking. Next, he praises Sequence Generator Pro as set-and-forget and there is a short relaxing electronic music sting playing as he transitions to \"quicker astronomy news.\" He then invites a Carina Nebula photo challenge and mellow jazz music starts and continues underneath. A title card \"ASCOM (COMING TO MAC?!)\" appears while he talks about a Rasa 8 review and ASCOM possibly coming to Mac, followed by short generic music. Finally, closing starry scenes with \"Thanks for watching! Leave a like or subscribe\" overlay appear with upbeat retro game-style music.",

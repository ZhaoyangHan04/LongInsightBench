After that, electronic music fades in while the speaker talks about Io's movement. Finally, the view shifts to a distorted map as the speaker announces the start of Io's transit across Jupiter's face.",

A graphic design screen with the text “See more on my blog astroandmusic.blogspot.com” appears while the speaker frames looking out over “24 hours of Jupiter’s sky” from the equator.\n2. A labeled star field is shown as the speaker discusses Jupiter’s rotation and the moons Io and Ganymede; a steady drone swells into music.\n3. Over the labeled stars, the speaker says he hopes human eyes will witness these events in the future, but for now they can only simulate them.\n4.

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5.\nThe audio starts with the host calling diffraction spikes \"lame\" and asking for a civil discussion, which happens at time interval (1). This is followed by a sponsor thank-you message at time interval (2), along with a telescope advertisement. At time interval (3), a laser demonstration is shown where a horizontal wire produces a vertical spike. Finally, at time interval (4), JWST graphics appear as the host mentions that stars are actually round and that the spikes are not part of reality. Lastly, at time interval (5), the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is shown as the host discusses refractors' size limits and notes that stars in art and history have always had spikes.\nTherefore, the events in the audio follow the sequence of option D: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5.",

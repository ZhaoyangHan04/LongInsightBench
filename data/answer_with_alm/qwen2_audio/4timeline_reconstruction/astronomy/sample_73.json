A scale bar labeled \"100,000 light-years\" appears while the speaker discusses using infrared to see through dust.\n  4. A static graphic shows \"Dark Matter halo\" above a Milky Way logo as the speaker explains we don't know what dark matter is.\n  5. A white line points from the galactic core to a yellow star labeled \"25,000 LY\" as the speaker states the solar system's distance from the center.\n  6. A diagram highlights the Sun's orbit time as the speaker says a galactic year is over 200 million years.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

Then, a red laser beam points into the Milky Way band while the narrator says it’s very difficult to know our galaxy’s appearance because we’re within it (3). This leads us to the galaxy diagram that shows labels such as \"Younger Stars,\" \"Older Stars,\" and \"High Density Gas\" (2).\n\nNext, the narrator states that the Milky Way's arms are made of dust and gas making up 10-15% of luminous matter (4). We then see labels \"Perseus Arm\" and \"Scutum-Centaurus Arm\" appear as the narrator says there are two major spiral arms (5).\n\nAfter these descriptions, we hear about the Sun’s long galactic year being over 200 million years (6). Finally, after an invitation to like and subscribe, a new speaker starts discussing Betelgeuse and the word \"beetlejuice\" appears on screen (7).\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events is 1",

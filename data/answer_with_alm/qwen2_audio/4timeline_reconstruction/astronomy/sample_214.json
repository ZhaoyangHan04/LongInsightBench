(4) He explains the C11 at 2800 mm and that he's using no filter with an off-axis guider.

Then, he mentions having around 140 images and using a sub-frame selector after calibration, suggesting steps 5 and 4 occurred next. Next, he shows the final galaxy with a tech overlay, which indicates that step 3 happened. Afterward, he notes his CPU spiking and changes the measurement to FWHM to check focus, suggesting that step 6 happened. Finally, he sorts the remaining frames and moves them to a \"Good Subs\" folder, and jokes about copying taking a million years before playing a Super Mario sound and thanking subscribers, indicating that steps 1 and 7 happened last.",

The first event is the introduction of the universe by a female voice, followed by a bar chart showing the distribution of matter and energy. Then comes the discussion of weak gravitational lensing and its use in studying dark matter and dark energy. Next, there is a scene showing night observatories and a mention of Chilean mountains and a stable atmosphere. This is followed by a graph showing the results of the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 and an explanation of redshift. Finally, there is a scene showing the concept of redshift and how it relates to the movement of galaxies away from us.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the moments is option B: 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5.\n\nFirstly, the narrator introduces the observable universe and its limits due to the speed of light as Earth-from-space appears, which happens at moment 3. Then, the speaker cites \"Hubble's Law,\" noting it's space itself that expands, over spiral-galaxy visuals, which occurs next at moment 2. After that, a question is posed about what's causing the speed-up? While fiery, accelerating visuals appear, which happens at moment 4. Finally, the narrator states \"the answer lies in what we call dark energy\" as multiple Earths orbit a bright central light, and then explains that viewing distant galaxies means looking back in time because light has a finite speed, which concludes the sequence at moment 5.",

Option B is incorrect because the sequence should not include two separate mentions of quantum physics. Option C is incorrect because the sequence should not include two separate mentions of lightless realms. Option D is the correct answer because it follows the sequence of events described in the audio.",

Then, the professor begins speaking at 1.02 seconds and his speech overlaps with the music until 10.00 seconds. In between, Figure 29.1 appears from 2.20 seconds to 10.00 seconds, overlapping with the professor's speech. Einstein and Hubble's photos appear from 3.16 seconds to 4.04 seconds, overlapping with the professor's speech. The expansion-rate graph appears from 4.74 seconds to 6.00 seconds, overlapping with the professor's speech. Finally, Figure 29.5 appears from 6.28 seconds to 7.54 seconds, overlapping with the professor's speech. The two-balloons redshift diagram appears from 7.79 seconds to 10.00 seconds, overlapping with the professor's speech.",

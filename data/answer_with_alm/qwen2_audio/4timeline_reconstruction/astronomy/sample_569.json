(2) Underwater bubbles appear while gurgling water sounds are heard. (3) On-screen text identifies “Michele Dougherty, Professor of Space Physics, Imperial College London.” (4) The physicist states her involvement has been “the last 15 or 20 years.” (5) She describes Cassini’s discovery of water vapor outgassing from Enceladus. (6) She holds a small globe while explaining tidal heating of Jupiter’s moons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

This is followed by the female discussing JUICE's search for liquid water, heat, and organics on Jupiter's moon Europa. Then, bacteria found by a deep-sea submersible are mentioned, and a question from Professor Brian Cox is introduced. Afterward, a man in a black shirt appears on camera discussing Europa's potential for having an ocean and organic material beneath its surface. The female then mentions that JUICE's two flybys may not detect organics in Europa's plumes, but the Europa Clipper's 50 flybys might. Finally, they joke about returning in seven and a half years and mention the Loch Ness monster.",

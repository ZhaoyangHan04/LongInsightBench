Still in the workshop, he says James from DSO Imager invited him and Joe and that this will be the final capture session.\n3. He explains he changed the EQ6R Pro power lead to run from the Pegasus power box to reduce cable clutter.\n4. Outdoors at night, the on-screen text \"Music by Dan Shapiro Beyond The Skies\" appears as atmospheric music plays while he preps the telescope.\n5. In the backyard, he mentions the scope is balanced, that the observatory roof has opened and the camera is cooling for a Heart Nebula mosaic, and that he needs to turn off the light.\n6. A power switch click is heard; he says \"let's turn this power on\" and plans to polar align with an iPad before moving inside to set up NINA.\n7. A black screen shows yellow text thanking collaborators and stating a final HOO image from 93 hours, then the nebula image appears.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> ",

He explains a rejig, moving the guide scope, dovetail plate, camera, and focusing tube for better balance and space (0.96 - 3.00).\n3. He says he rotated the EAF and mentions a Losmandy plate section, expressing he’s happy with the arrangement (3.13 - 3.72).\n4. He states he’ll shorten wires to remove bunching by using correct-length cables (3.85 - 4.28).\n5. He explains fixing a faulty silicone power lead and now powers the EQ6R Pro from the Pegasus power box (4.42 - 5.28).\n6. At night outside, he says the scope is balanced and everything is being switched on to polar align; the observatory roof has opened and the camera is cooling (5.43 - 7.08).\n7. A power switch click is heard; he says “let’s turn this power on” and outlines starting with an iPad for polar alignment before moving inside",

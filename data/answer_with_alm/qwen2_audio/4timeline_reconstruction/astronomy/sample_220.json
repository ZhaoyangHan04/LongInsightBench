    "model_answer": "Option B seems like the most likely order based on the events described in the audio. Here's why:\n\n- First, we have a title card 'THE COSMIC COMPANION PRESENTS...' appearing while country music starts and a male voice begins singing. This suggests that option B, which has this sequence in reverse order, is the correct answer.\n- Next, the host announces a 'viewing guide to the solar eclipse' over the 'SOLAR ECLIPSE 2024' title card. This event seems to be related to the country music and male singing, so it could potentially come after them in the timeline.\n- A mannequin wearing sunglasses appears with on-screen 'NOT suitable' as the narrator warns never to look at the sun. This event seems to be unrelated to the previous ones, so it could come at any point in the timeline.\n- Over shots of people filming the sky, a female voice says 'Why not do both? YOLO'. This event also seems to be unrelated to the previous ones, so it could come at any point in the timeline.\n- Finally, in a theater, a poster for 'The Wizard and The Scholar' is shown as a voice promotes watching the first trailer at a website and",

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\nFirstly, we have the two costumed characters on a starry backdrop, which sets the stage for the performance that is about to occur. This is followed by one character boasting about being the center of the solar system, which leads to a discussion about the solar eclipse. The first character then makes a statement about pride and falls, which introduces a humorous element to the conversation.\nNext, the title of the SOLAR ECLIPSE 2024 ECLIPSE VIEWING GUIDE appears on the screen, indicating that the discussion has turned towards the upcoming event. A U.S. time map is shown, and the narrator advises viewers to check NASA or other sources for eclipse times. Finally, a card listing the next total eclipses is displayed, and the narrator wishes happy eclipse viewing before taking a break for the upcoming film.\nTherefore, the sequence of events is as follows: Costumed characters on a starry backdrop -> Solar eclipse discussion -> Pride and fall joke -> SOLAR ECLIPSE 2024 ECLIPSE VIEWING GUIDE title -> U.S. time map -> Eclipse times advice -> Next total eclipses",

Then, there is a nostalgic talk about stargazing (2), followed by the display of the title card and the explanation of the Earth-Moon system (3). Next, the caption about the distance between the Earth and the Moon appears (4), and this is followed by a discussion about the Apollo missions (5). Finally, the audio ends with the mention of the Apollo 13 launch (6).\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events is: Seated before a dark blue curtain, he says he isn’t a teacher and will avoid complex maths. (1) > Nostalgic countryside stargazing talk, radio static follows as a starry sky fills the frame. (2) > The title card “Astronomy with Finlarg Part 1 The Earth - Moon System” appears while he calls the moon a “huge ball of rock.” (3) > The caption “Full moon to full moon = 29 and a half days” appears as he explains it’s because the Earth–Moon system orbits the",

    "model_answer": "The correct order of events in the video is:\n\n1. The speaker starts by showing slides with information about the moon's diameter and mass, comparing it to the size of the Earth. This sets the stage for the topic of the moon's formation and orbit.\n2. Next, the speaker mentions other gas giants like Jupiter and how they will be covered in future videos, indicating that the topic of planetary orbits and moons is broader than just the Earth-Moon system.\n3. The dramatic collision sequence that formed the moon is described next, providing context for the moon's current position and orbit around the Earth.\n4. The speaker then contrasts the moon's mass and gravity with that of the Earth, demonstrating the differences between the two bodies and how humans would experience them differently if they were on the moon.\n5. Finally, the speaker shows images of astronauts on the lunar surface and discusses the possibility of building a future lunar base. He also mentions the visibility of the Earth and stars from the moon, which could make it an ideal location for an astronomical observatory. This brings the discussion full circle back to the moon's significance in astronomy and space exploration.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.",

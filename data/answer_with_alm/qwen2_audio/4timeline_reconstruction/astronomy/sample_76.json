This event sets the scene for the rest of the sub-events.\nNext, a laptop shows colorful graphs while a male voice says one spectrum takes about a minute and a year's worth of data makes pictures of the galactic center (Option 3). This provides context for the data analysis that follows.\nThen, the Milky Way is shown while a female voice explains slow sky scanning to build spectroscopic data (Option 4). This introduces another aspect of scientific observation at the South Pole.\nAfterwards, a close-up of a satellite dish as a male voice explains the main mirror focusing light, with a soft thumping in the background (Option 5). This introduces another tool used for scientific observation at the South Pole.\nFinally, an outdoor station view with red arrows as a female voice says the sky emits EM energy and uneven water vapor adds noise (Option 6). This provides a broader view of the South Pole environment and its challenges for scientific research.\nTherefore, the events in the video follow the sequence of Option",

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is: 4 -> 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3\nOption A is the correct answer. The visual elements in the video follow this sequence: First, an intense fiery explosion fills the frame, which corresponds to event 4. Then, a male voice says the ring coagulates, triggers a starburst, and fuels a black hole, which corresponds to event 2. After that, a new scene shows a control room where a male voice mentions that the spectrum is much better due to atmospheric noise being random and less noise at the Pole, which corresponds to event 3. Next, credits and a sky map appear, and a female voice describes the newer South Pole Telescope probing the CMB and dark energy, which corresponds to event 6. Following that, we see a snowfield with a green flag, and a female voice discusses water vapor's effect on observations, with wind sounds, which corresponds to event 5. Finally, a fiery object labeled \"X2\" appears, and a male voice explains gas transitioning between X-1 and X-2 orbits near the galactic center, which corresponds to event 1. Lastly, a laptop with colorful spectra is shown, and a female voice says a survey",

This is followed by a slide showing how AHP works, which is related to the mathematical method being discussed. Then, there is a step-by-step list slide that concludes the explanation before the speaker moves on to an example using the AHP method. Finally, the \"AHP â€“ Example\" slide appears, which provides context for the demonstration of the method.",

Then, the speaker moves on to explaining how to compute the normalized principal eigenvector (option B). After that, the speaker shows a matrix of comparisons and instructs to evaluate alternatives using AHP (option C). Next, the speaker reveals the results of the AHP evaluation, stating that Model 1 has the highest ranking (option D). Finally, the speaker discusses the cost-benefit analysis and recommends Model 1 over other models (option E).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n  1. The title card \"earthlings 101\" with UFOs appears as the speaker welcomes the episode and introduces good/evil over electronic music.\n  2. The green alien points at a red brain behind a pink figure while the speaker outlines ego, beast, and the \"niggler,\" calling this self-awareness.\n  3. Amid harsh visuals and brain imagery, the speaker says self-awareness is extremely unpleasant and asks, \"But what's this good and evil thing anyway?\"\n  4. Colored stick figures line up as the speaker explains good helps the group, evil harms it, and references the \"prisoner's dilemma.\"\n  5. A whooshing sound transitions into the speakerâ€™s \"scientific advice\" about putting Earthlings in moral dilemmas while a UFO beams the alien into a lab.\n  6. After contrasting a murderer with a soldier, the speech abruptly cuts to a fart sound effect as police, soldiers, and a circle of archetypes are shown.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is B: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.\nFirstly, the speaker introduces the hypothetical arrest of Cthulhu and Lord Zenu for messing with Earth, which is followed by the network of circles being highlighted as the speaker analyzes betrayal versus cooperation. This is then followed by the clan-with-goats analogy, where stealing becomes pointless and figures collapse beside goats. Next, the speaker explains evolution's solution through the \"nigila,\" which punishes theft with remorse and rewards sharing. After this, tourist tips are mentioned about abducting a cow and the consequences of getting locked in a secret facility. Then, a long segment contrasts Red vs Green tribes and different standards, with various visual elements appearing throughout. Finally, the video ends with a \"next episode: games, dreams, and fiction\" card and upbeat chiptune music.",

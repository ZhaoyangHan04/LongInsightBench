Then, Eske Willerslev announces that there will be a press release tomorrow about the first original Australian genome (2).\nAfter that, Eske explains their method of using a 1920s Southwestern Australian hair sample to avoid recent European admixture (3). Dr Michael Bunce then describes the process of isolating DNA from hair shafts (4).\nDr Joe Dortch then discusses how archaeological evidence suggests that modern humans have been present in Australia for over 70,000 years (6). Finally, the speaker compares sequencing to a \"billion-piece jigsaw\" (5).",

Event 2 builds on this by mentioning a specific event related to human migrations. Event 3 provides additional context by explaining how the mixing of different populations affected physical traits. Event 4 connects the dots by comparing genetic analysis to assembling a puzzle. Event 5 introduces a new perspective by highlighting the difficulty of the sea crossing. Finally, Event 6 brings everything together by explaining the origin of the research being presented.",

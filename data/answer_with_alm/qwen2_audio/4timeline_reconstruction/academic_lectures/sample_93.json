    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\nExplanation: The narrator starts by saying he will cover true bearing first, then magnetic bearing. This indicates that the video starts with option A. Then, the narrator instructs to identify “from” and “to” and draws a line between the two points while positioning true north. This leads into option B. Next, the protractor is aligned with a longitude line as the narrator explains aligning true north precisely. This is followed by option C. After that, while measuring on the map, the narrator states the result “94 to be accurate” for the true bearing. This is related to option D. Finally, immediately after stating this result, the narrator says “let’s reverse the question.” This brings us to option E. Lastly, the narrator poses a hypothetical true-bearing question and reiterates starting by drawing true north, while the hand draws the line. This completes the sequence of events.",

Then the narrator explains how to calculate magnetic bearing, which involves using the true bearing and magnetic declination. This process is described in detail, starting from step 3, where the compass reading is noted. Finally, the result is announced at the end of the fifth event. Therefore, the correct order of events is 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on complexity theory for help. The video starts with the title 'Complexity Theory' appearing, then the speaker starts talking about self-organization, which leads to the concept of emergence. After that, entropy and synchronization are introduced in relation to information theory and complex networks. Finally, the speaker moves on to nonlinear systems and chaos theory.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

'NonEquilibrium' walking figures appear as the narrator explains change far from equilibrium governed by feedback.\n3. The title 'Network Theory' appears with an undulating network as the speaker calls it another major area and a formal mathematical language.\n4. The phrase 'Data is King' appears with floating file icons as the speaker says science is driven by real-time data sets, not models.\n5. The screen reads 'Graph Theory' and 'Computer Science' before the narration transitions to complex adaptive systems.\n6. 'Complex Adaptive Systems' appears with butterflies as the narrator gives examples like schools of fish.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

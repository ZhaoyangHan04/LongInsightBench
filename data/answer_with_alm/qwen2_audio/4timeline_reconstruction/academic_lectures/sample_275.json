The title appears first, followed by the 3D subduction-zone diagram. This is then connected to the discussion of California's geological features, leading to the showing of the satellite view and the animation of the Loma Prieta earthquake.

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is option B: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4.\nFirstly, in (2), we have a satellite view of the Montara Mountain area, which leads us to (1), where we learn about the Bishop Tuff and the formation of the Long Valley caldera through a large eruption.\nIn (3), the review quiz appears along with the countdown timer, indicating that we are moving on to another topic related to the content being discussed.\nNext, in (4), we learn about the Devil's Slide and the deposition of sediments due to changing sea levels.\nFinally, in (5), we return to the present day and the field trip, where we get to see the evidence of accreted terranes at Baker Beach.\nTherefore, the sequence is as follows: We start with a geographical location (2), move on to a geological event (1), discuss a geological time period (4), and finish with a current-day observation (5).",

After that, the slide titled “Methods” appears, where the speaker discusses the importance of IRB approval. Subsequently, text overlays ask about inclusion and exclusion criteria while the speaker explains how to describe the sample for replication. Then, a slide labeled “Data Analysis” appears, where the speaker talks about appropriate statistical tests and significance level. Next, a slide prompt asks about the conclusion section, and the speaker provides an example of predicted significance but results were not significant. Finally, a final slide states the conclusion should include limitations and future research, and the University of Utah logos appear as the speaker concludes the presentation.",

Option B has the same issue with the order of slides. Option D has the slides in the right order but the last two slides are switched. Option C correctly orders the slides and also keeps the content logical.",

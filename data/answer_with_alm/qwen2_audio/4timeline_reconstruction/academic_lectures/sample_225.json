This could be followed by event 3 (the speaker describing theories like lung/diaphragm pulses), since the book may contain information related to these theories.\n\nEvent 1 (the speaker discussing syllables and trouble with them) likely comes next, as this topic is relevant to the yellow book and the speaker's experience in second grade.\n\nOption C (3 -> 6 -> 2 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4) is incorrect because it places event 3 (scenic shot of the University of Illinois campus) before event 6 (stick figure and machine), which is not supported by the provided visual and audio cues.\n\nOption D (6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 7 -> 1 ->",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2.\nFirstly, the \"Hell Mit\" vs \"Helm It\" drawings appear, which likely occur before the other events since they are described as happening during the analysis of the word 'helmet'. This event seems to be the starting point for the sequence.\nNext, we have the appearance of three yellow ovals labeled \"Word\", which suggests that this event comes next in the sequence. This is followed by credits and a helmeted stick figure speech bubble, which could indicate that these elements either follow immediately after the yellow ovals or are part of the same event.\nAfter these events, we see blue ovals and CV diagrams being displayed, which implies that this event occurs next in the sequence. This is then followed by a light bulb labeled \"Syllable\" and blue-oval visuals, which suggest that this event comes last in the sequence.\nFinally, the speaker's comments about syllables and word boundaries occur, which seem to be part of the same event as the previous blue oval display. Therefore, the correct chronological order of the sub-events is 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2.",

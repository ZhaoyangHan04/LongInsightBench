    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n  1. A photo of the Twin Towers billowing smoke appears with the on-screen date, while the speaker explains this was the view from near his home by Ground Zero.\n  2. Footage shows a person leaning over a railing under the smoke as the speaker says no one thought “terrorism” until the second plane.\n  3. The speaker quotes a post-9/11 Bush line about “our God is the God who named the stars,” prompting laughter as the slide title reads “Arabic Star Names.”\n  4. The slide changes to “Islam AD 800 -> 1100” while he explains Baghdad’s open intellectual center with Jews and Christians exchanging ideas.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option D: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \n1. The speaker starts by discussing naming rights and how certain things are named based on who discovered them first and did it best. This leads into a discussion about U.S. particle physics and the Californian-named elements, including a brief mention of Sir Weinberg.\n2. Next, the speaker jokes about the U.S. having naming rights over the internet because they were the first to exploit it. This is followed by a comment about British postage stamps lacking a country name because they invented them.\n3. After these interjections, the speaker moves on to discuss future economies and how science and technology will play a crucial role in shaping them. He warns that revelation has replaced investigation and emphasizes the importance of these fields moving forward.\nTherefore, the correct order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5. Option A is the correct answer.",

(2) He invokes the junction rule aloud: \"I1 = I2 + I3.\" (4) A loop equation \"-5I1 - 6I2 - 3I3 + 2 = 0\" appears on the whiteboard as he mentions multiplying by -1 to remove negatives. (1) The speaker says \"that's it for labeling currents\" and announces labeling loops A, B, and C.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 4.",

He sets up the resistors and their corresponding current values.\n  3. He explains the process of obtaining three linear equations with three unknowns using Kirchhoff's rules.\n  4. He proceeds to write these equations into an augmented matrix and row-reduce it to find the values of each current.\n  5. Finally, he uses the current values and resistance values to determine the voltage across and power dissipated by the resistors.\n  6. The video ends with a summary of the steps taken and some additional information about the subject matter.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 4.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on world religions for help. The events happen in the following order: First, the speaker talks about fatigue and the temptation to stop giving; then, the congregation is shown; after that, the speaker defines “alay” as offering oneself to God; next, the speaker summarizes with the phrase, “Alay, Aray, Amen.” Finally, a woman in a black face mask clasps her hands in prayer as the speaker recalls, “Father, let this suffering pass me by.”\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is: 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5\nOption B is the correct answer. \n\nThe audio starts with the speaker explaining something which indicates that option 2 (the camera showing masked attendees in pews) is the first event. Then, the speaker moves on to talking about sacrifice and pain, which leads us to option 4 (everyone should follow God). This is followed by option 1 (wondering if God is present), and finally, option 3 (declaring grace after sacrifice and pain) and option 5 (a religious mural preceding the talk about hurt and sacrifice).\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events is: The camera shows masked attendees in pews -> Everyone should follow God -> There is a wonder if God is present and still answering prayers -> After sacrifice and pain, grace is given to say “Amen.” -> A close-up of a religious mural precedes the speaker’s emotionally charged talk about hurt and sacrifice, asking if offering to God is still possible amid difficulty.",

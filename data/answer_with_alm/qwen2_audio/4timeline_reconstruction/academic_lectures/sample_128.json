This was followed by the appearance of a poster of William the Conqueror. Then, the speaker divided the Middle English period into three parts - Before Chaucer, the Age of Chaucer, and the Age of Revival. After that, the equation Old English + French = Middle English was shown as an example. Finally, the origins of English words were explained with a pie chart, and the contrast between the language of the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes before 1066 and the language of the Normans after was highlighted.

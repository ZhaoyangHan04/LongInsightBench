    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is option D: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5.\nFirstly, in visual 1, we see a stick figure pointing at a Grimm's Law diagram, which indicates that the speech will discuss linguistic changes. This happens at the beginning of the audio (0.00).\nIn visual 3, we see a speech bubble saying 'General American English,' which suggests that the topic moves on to a specific dialect or variety of English. This occurs around 2 minutes into the audio (2.00).\nIn visual 4, we see a phonology lesson where the sound 'th' is being explained, which takes place around 3 minutes into the audio (3.00).\nFinally, in visual 5, we see text that mentions the present tense system and someone working, which implies a discussion about grammar. This occurs towards the end of the audio (5.00).\n\nTherefore, the sequence of the visuals corresponds to option D, with the speech about language changes leading into a discussion of English dialects, followed by a phonology lesson, and concluding with a lesson on grammar.",

The word \"bilingual\" is crossed out and replaced by an English tree branching to AAVE and General American.\n  3. A diagram shows English diverging from Early Modern English to AAVE, General American, and British.\n  4. A map of the Atlantic displays arrows of the transatlantic movement of enslaved Africans.\n  5. Arrows illustrate the Great Migration from the U.S. South to the North.\n  6. A diagram expands to include Yoruba, Hausa, and Ful feeding into AAVE.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

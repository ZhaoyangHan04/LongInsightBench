    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on philosophy for help. Let's solve this step by step. We see the narrator introduce Peter Singer’s essay, so we place that at the beginning (1). Then, the屏幕上显示“trolley problem”，这应该是在讨论一个经典的哲学问题，所以把它放在第二位（2）。接着，我们听到背景音乐开始播放，同时出现了一张写有“HOMELESS AND HUNGRY”的纸板，这暗示着接下来要展示的内容与贫困和饥饿有关，所以我们把第三位放在这里（3）。之后，屏幕上出现了地球的图像，并且叙述者说我们的责任是基于公正，这说明第四位（4）和第五位（5）分别对应了这些内容。\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

The speaker states “the duty to help others is not absolute,” with wind audible in the background.\n3. Volunteers hand out bottled water at tents as the speaker mentions “uncertainty” about aid effectiveness.\n4. On-screen text reads “the role of government is important” as the speaker explains governmental responsibility.\n5. A quote on-screen asserts it is “unfair to expect individuals to bear the burden” while the speaker discusses systemic solutions.\n6. The speaker declares “charity is a personal choice, not a moral obligation” as coins and bills fall on screen.\n7. The speaker invites opinions and gentle, contemplative music plays as “thank you for watching” appears.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.",

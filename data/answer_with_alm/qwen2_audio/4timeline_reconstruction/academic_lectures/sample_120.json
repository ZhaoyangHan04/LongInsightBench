The fast-motion demo starts at 4 seconds, followed by the finger snap at 2 seconds. Then, eight light bulbs representing a byte appear at 3 seconds. After that, all four bulbs turn on, and the sum of their values is counted at 5 seconds. Next, a binary joke appears, and the lights are labeled with powers of two starting from 6 seconds. Finally, fast-motion counting begins at 6 seconds with electronic music.",

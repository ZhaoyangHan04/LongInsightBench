    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is: 4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 2\nThe video starts with upbeat intro music and the presenter greeting viewers. Then, she explains that in the United States, the same colored needle is correlated with the same type of medication. Next, she shows a yellow-coded 24-gauge needle with a safety lock and mentions it's not ideal for blood products. After that, she describes an 18-gauge used in ERs and by paramedics while assembling it on a red-plunger syringe. In the next scene, she inserts a blue needle into a hub and states her preference for a 20-gauge for vein access. Finally, in a close-up shot, an orange-capped insulin syringe is uncapped as she calls it a 29-gauge. The video ends with thanks and a screen asking viewers to like, share, and subscribe.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \n2 - She opens a small package and attaches a filtered needle, explaining itâ€™s for glass vials and warning about recapping. \n3 - She says a 20-gauge gives a solid IV site once mastered. \n5 - She says this one is her favorite and that you can give blood products and IV fluids. \n1 - She locks a safety feature and explains the inverse numbering (24 is smaller than 22) seen on adult med-surg floors. \n4 - She introduces a blunt needle with a very large hole used only to draw/mix medications, saying never to poke a patient with it. \n6 - She identifies an 18-gauge used in ERs/paramedics, often in the antecubital area. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6 -> 1 -> 4.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is option D: 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 3 -> 7 -> 1 -> 8.\nFirstly, we have event 2 where Roman architects are referred to as 'masters of the arch and the dome' which implies that they were known for their architectural skills particularly in designing domes and arches. This is followed by event 4 where Alexander the Great is mentioned to have ended the classical period, indicating a historical context. Next, event 5 takes place where light, playful music starts playing, which could be a transition into a new section or scene. Event 3 then occurs where the narrator renames Greek gods for Romans, which provides cultural context. After this, event 7 happens where workers set up scaffolding, which could imply that a new location or scene is being introduced. Subsequently, event 1 takes place where the narrator introduces the topic of the podcast, which is explorations in art history. Finally, event 8 concludes the podcast with a reflection on Greek/Roman ideas spreading across Europe, accompanied by visual cues such as maps and images.",

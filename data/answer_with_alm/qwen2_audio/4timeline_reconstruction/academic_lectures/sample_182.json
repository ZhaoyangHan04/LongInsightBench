    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: First,Thought bubbles appear above a mountain labeled LIBido. This indicates that stage one of Freud's psychosexual development theory is being discussed. Next, we see a title card for the oral phase (age 0-1), which aligns with the fact that babies suckle during this stage. Then, two children are shown standing in front of a mirror, which corresponds to the phallic stage (age 3-5). Subsequently, a subtitle appears with \"Conscious\" and \"Preconscious\" labels, which could refer to the next stage of psychosexual development. After that, a patient is shown lying on a couch as a therapist listens, which is related to the latency stage (age 6-12). Finally, the \"MinuteEarth\" title and credits sequence appears at the end. Therefore, the correct order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6. Option B correctly orders the events based on the provided information.",

    "model_answer": "Option C seems like the most logical sequence based on the imagery provided. The sequence starts with the concept of psychosexual development, represented by the orange sphere in a vortex. This is followed by a child looking up at it, suggesting that this concept is being introduced or explained to them. Then we see a group of children smiling together, which could represent a communal experience related to psychosexual development. \n\nThe next image shows a toddler sitting on a potty, which could be seen as a milestone in a child's life that is influenced by psychosexual development. After that, we have a couple sitting on a couch with a kissing thought bubble, which could represent the sexual aspect of psychosexual development. Finally, we see a person thinking, with a brain and a baby appearing in a thought bubble, which could represent the cognitive aspect of psychosexual development.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is: 6 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4.",

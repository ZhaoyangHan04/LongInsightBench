    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is option A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\n\nThe first event is the blue title card \"FERTILIZATION,\" which appears at the beginning of the video and introduces the topic of sperm and egg viability. This is followed by an animation that highlights \"300 million sperm\" traveling and shows embryo development. The third event is the on-screen label \"hcg\" appearing during the implantation discussion, which marks the point in the process where a woman can take a pregnancy test. The fourth event is the blue screen asking \"HOW LONG DOES IMPLANTATION OCCUR?\" and the speaker's response provides an equation for calculating the length of time it takes for sperm to travel, fertilize eggs, and be implanted in the uterus. The fifth event is the circular graphic with \"MENSTRUATION\" and \"FERTILITY,\" which appears while the speaker advises waiting until after a missed period to test. Finally, the text \"Average time for implantation is 6 to 12 DPO\" appears, providing additional information about when women should expect their first positive pregnancy test.",

This is followed by President Clinton's speech, indicating that event 1 has taken place. Then, a metallic clink is heard, which suggests that event 4 has happened. After this, computer screens display DNA data, and a speaker mentions that it's digital with four digits instead of two, which indicates that event 5 has occurred. Finally, Carlos Bustamante appears on the screen, which means that event 3 has taken place.\nTherefore, the sequence of events is as follows: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3.",

This is followed by cascading visuals of \"Share Data,\" suggesting event 4. As the speaker talks about sharing discoveries, upbeat strings begin playing, indicating event 5.\n\nEvent 1 occurs next, as a speaker calls it an \"incredibly exciting moment.\" This is followed by a clinician using a stethoscope, a hopeful synth melody playing, and a voice concluding that it's \"exhilarating.\" This suggests that event 3 takes place after event 1.\n\nFinally, event 4 occurs, where a black-and-white eugenics exhibit photo is shown, along with a woman mentioning forced sterilization laws. The somber strings that accompany this event suggest that it comes last in the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3.",

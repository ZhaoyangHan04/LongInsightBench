    "model_answer": "The correct timeline would be option C: 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3. \n\nFirst, the narrator mentions that lymph nodes secrete thymosin, which indicates that step 2 should come before step 1. This means that we should start with option C.\n\nNext, the narrator describes the thymus gland, which is a part of the lymphatic system. Since the thymus gland is related to the lymphatic system, step 4 should follow after step 2.\n\nAfter discussing the thymus gland, the narrator mentions that thymosin may stimulate lymphocyte migration. Since lymphocytes are produced by the bone marrow, step 5 should come after step 4.\n\nFinally, the narrator mentions that the thymus gland shrinks after puberty. This means that step 1 should come last in the timeline.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of steps in the timeline is 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on clinical knowledge for help. The sequence is: The female narrator details head, spine, arms, and feet placement for the supine position. A smooth jazz music interlude begins. The narrator resumes to describe the Trendelenburg position (a supine variation). The narrator explains a position that allows access to the lower abdominal cavity and warns shoulder braces can endanger the brachial plexus. On-screen text reads \"Reverse Trendelenburg Position\" beside the patient. The narrator describes Reverse Trendelenburg as enabling access to the upper peritoneal cavity; then simple upbeat music starts. On-screen text \"Lithotomy Position\" appears over the patient on the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.\nOption B correctly orders the events based on the description provided in the audio. The staff first lifts the patient's legs together and places them onto the draped supports (Event 1), followed by the simultaneous lifting of both legs with feet supported in stirrups or leg braces (Event 2). Then, a mechanism activates during lithotomy setup, which is followed by brief male and female verbal acknowledgments (Event 3). Next, the patient's elevated legs are secured with white bandages and black straps on a mechanical support (Event 4). After a short electronic music transition, the narrator introduces the lateral (Sims) position (Event 5). On-screen text then appears reading \"Lateral (Sims) Position,\" and the staff adjusts the patient into this position (Event 6). Finally, a calm female voice describes the Jackknife/Kraske prone modification used for anal-rectal surgery (Event 7).\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7, making option B the correct answer.",

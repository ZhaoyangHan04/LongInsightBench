    "model_answer": "The correct order is A: 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4.\nFirst, we have the Patreon/Discord outro, which indicates that this is the last segment of the video. Then, we have the speaker inviting donations and signing off with \"I'll see you next time.\" This is followed by an electronic sting.\nNext, we have the \"AWAKENING\" screen with a red, smoky demon. This is followed by the speaker arguing that the venom demon does not prove awakening and outlining what awakening would entail.\nAfter that, we have the \"MAGELLAN'S USE\" section. The speaker starts by describing poison armor and hydra conjurations while purple ghostly figures are shown. Then, the speaker clarifies limited immunity to external poisons and mentions Magellan's bathroom time from eating outside poisons.\nFinally, we have the \"MISCELLANEOUS/CONCLUSION\" section. The speaker considers peaceful applications and then adds the fruit to the encyclopedia. This is followed by the horned figure dripping purple.\nTherefore, the correct order of the sub-events is 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4.",

Then, a PRIMARY KEY slide appears, which leads to the speaker discussing the concept of primary keys and how there can be more than one candidate key. This is followed by the selection of REG_ID as the primary key in the Find Student Interface, which indicates the occurrence of event 3. Next, a FOREIGN KEY slide appears, leading to the discussion of relationships between tables and the need for another table. This sets up the context for the subsequent events. Finally, the video ends with the discussion of composite, compound, and surrogate keys, so the last event is 6. Therefore, the correct chronological order of the events is 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6.",

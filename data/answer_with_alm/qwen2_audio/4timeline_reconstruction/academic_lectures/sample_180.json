    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is option B: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6.\n\nFirstly, a male voice starts a \"quick recap\" about genetic relation and language expansion, which indicates that event 2 happens before event 1. Then, a diagram with a red \"descended\" bubble over colored speech bubbles appears, which shows that event 3 comes after event 2. This is followed by the speaker explaining proto-languages and genetic relatedness, indicating that event 1 happens after event 3. Next, we see Spanish/Portuguese word pairs being shown under a \"comparative method\" label, which suggests that event 4 comes after event 3. After this, on a beach, a stick figure examines a skull, and a red X appears, which indicates that event 5 happens after event 4. Finally, on a world map with stick figures labeled \"100,000 YBP,\" we see a female voice mentioning humans in Africa around 100,000 years ago, which means that event 6 happens last.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4",

The comparative method’s limits are explained while Spanish/Portuguese pairs are shown under a \"comparative method\" label.\n  2. A stick figure stands on Earth beside a spider and a bird with crossed-out speech bubbles as the narrator asks when language abilities evolved and says \"Who knows?\".\n  3. A list reading \"Proto-World Existed / Sort of Existed / Didn't Exist\" is shown while a woman outlines scenarios and says \"proto-world didn’t exist at all.\"\n  4. A divergence diagram of humans, chimpanzees, and bonobos (7 million YBP) appears as a female voice mentions humans in Africa ~100,000 years ago and the 7-million-year divergence.\n  5. A stick figure points to a green bubble listing consonants and vowels as a male voice says Proto-World probably had both but beyond that we don’t really know.\n  6. A woman says \"See you soon for more linguistics videos,\" credits for songs appear, and then rock music starts.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 ->",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events in the audio is:\n\n1. A hand draws a person at a desk with a book while the speaker emphasizes doing research before deciding.\n2. The on-screen text “ONCE ONE DETERMINES HOW TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE ISSUE…” appears above a kneeling figure.\n3. A winding road and a brick wall are drawn as the speaker asks for paths to be made easy and barriers to be erected.\n4. A mouse is drawn near the praying person as the narration explains God may guide the heart to peace or aversion.\n5. A praying silhouette with raised hands is completed while the speaker stresses patience and that the supplication must be made by the individual, not for forbidden or obligatory acts.\n6. The speaker mentions repeating Istikhara until feeling comfortable as a static frame shows the blue verse text and the praying silhouette.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

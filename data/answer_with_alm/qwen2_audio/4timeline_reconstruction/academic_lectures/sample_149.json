    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. The sequence should start with the concept of free market competition and consumer sovereignty, followed by the consequences of firms not satisfying consumer preferences, which leads to bankruptcy and resource transfer. Then comes the example of punishment through monetary fines, and how these fines are determined based on principles such as cost-benefit analysis. This is followed by a demonstration of how bargaining power is affected by consumer choices, leading to resolution of conflicts through arbitration. Finally, we see examples of how principles like justice and fairness are reflected in policies and decisions made by arbitrators and protection agencies.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

This sets the stage for the subsequent events.\nNext, we hear somber organ music and dollar figures, which suggest that the conflict has serious financial implications (Option 2).\nThe narration then describes a murder scenario, where a red male figure shoots a blue female (Option 3). This event serves as a visual cue for the narrative.\nAfter this, the narrator explains how the principles dispute is resolved through payment and consumer-driven bargaining power (Option 4). This ties into the previous event, as the conflict between pro- and anti-capital punishment groups could be seen as a principles dispute.\nWe then see arrows pointing from the \"Circumstances\" box toward the red side, which suggests that the circumstances surrounding the murder were favorable to the red side's perspective (Option 5).\nFinally, we see multiple firm logos and arrows reversing direction to show a broader network of payments related to the murder case (Option 6). This indicates that there are additional security firms and agreements involved in the case.\n",

    "model_answer": "The correct order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\nThe speaker starts by explaining the equipment required and then moves on to demonstrate different suturing techniques. First, he shows how to perform a 90-degree needle entry for a simple interrupted stitch. Then, he mentions trimming cut and avoiding excessive tension when dealing with wound edges. After that, he performs a vertical mattress suture with counted throws. This is followed by a discussion about slight eversion of wound edges and a flush sound that occurs after the suture has been tied. Finally, he demonstrates a pulley suture by passing back through the proximal skin loop and tying the knots. As he concludes his demonstration, the Creative Commons license screen appears. Therefore, the correct order of events is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

The events in the video are as follows: First, the speaker starts by saying 'Let us proceed, shall we?' and types a question into Google, which is 'Do Architects Do Math?'. Second, someone writes '4' on a whiteboard to solve '2+2=4', and the speaker emphasizes that architects do math. Third, a Google search result appears, which is 'Do Architects and Engineers Work Together?' and the speaker confirms that they do. Fourth, there is a sound effect of a court room gavel, and the speaker states that 'No, Architects Cannot Sign Structural Drawings.' Fifth, an animated book of ethics opens, showing 'Thou shalt not advertise,' and the speaker talks about advertising ethics and the gray area of social media.

The topic shifts to why architects use blueprints, which the speaker claims are outdated and smelly, introducing the concept of large printers.\n6. A search for \"why do architects sketch\" follows, leading to a discussion of the different types of lines architects use and why they sketch to generate ideas.\n7. Subsequently, the screen displays a query about how architects earn money and acquire clients, which the speaker mentions relies on word of mouth and social media.\n8. Finally, there is a discussion about the back-and-forth workflow between architects and engineers, where designs are sent and received for structural feedback.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: 1",

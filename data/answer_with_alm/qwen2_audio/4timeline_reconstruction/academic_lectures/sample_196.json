HUMAN PENIS\" and the ANU logo, followed by the presenter introducing himself and the topic. This is followed by a slide showing the range of human penis sizes in the video animation, which covers most men. Then, under the heading \"Many cultures, past & present,\" images of historical and traditional men appear, along with a mention of cod pieces and a penis gourd. Finally, there is a slide labeled \"Data Collection\" explaining how the researchers collected data for their study, followed by a slide showing the extremes of penis sizes.",

Then, there's a graph showing the most attractive penis size being outside the test range, which leads into a discussion on what traits matter in male attractiveness, including body shape, height, and penis size. This is followed by a graph highlighting that smaller penises were dismissed quickly in the data collection process. Finally, the \"Data Collection\" slide is referred to again, along with a standard evolutionary selection analysis, which seems to be a continuation of the previous discussion on traits and selection.",

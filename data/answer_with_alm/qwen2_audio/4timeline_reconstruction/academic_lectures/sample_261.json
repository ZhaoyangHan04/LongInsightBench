    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is option C: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.\nFirstly, we have the superhero flying with a red cape and making a declaration about electrical components, which indicates that event 1 comes first.\nNext, we hear a woman complaining about the lack of electricity, which suggests that event 2 follows after event 1.\nEvent 3 occurs when a man reminisces about the past without various appliances like fans, tube lights, TV, or radio. This memory leads into the discussion about whether hospital equipment runs on electricity and whether sunlight can be used at night.\nFinally, in event 5, children are using a torch and observe that there is no power on the street. They notice a light on the street pole, which marks the end of the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.",

Then, a text screen defines solar energy over a starry night sky before the scene shifts to daytime (event 2).\nIn daylight, the children ask an engineer uncle why there are many power cuts; he replies that a wire got cut and they cut supply during wind and rain (event 3). Next, the man cautions that heavy winds can bring down wires and people may be electrocuted; a girl then asks about the heating effect of electricity (event 4).\nFinally, a demonstration shows an immersion rod heating water and mentions cooking on an electric stove (event 5). Additionally, an explanation of symbols and a simple circuit (battery, switch, bulb, wire) is given, with a danger sign also shown (event 6).",

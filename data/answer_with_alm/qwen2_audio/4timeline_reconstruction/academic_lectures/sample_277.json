    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Letâ€™s solve this step by step. We see the cursor moving over the chest X-ray, so we know that event 1 comes first. Next, the speaker reviews shoulders, clavicles, and scapula for fractures, which leads us to event 2. Then, he counts ribs, starting from the right first posterior rib to look for fractures, which means event 3 comes next. After that, he traces the cardiomediastinal silhouette, mentioning the aortic knob and hila, which makes event 4 the next. Lastly, we hear soft piano music fading as he follows the trachea and compares lungs in a zigzag pattern, which indicates that event 5 comes last.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, which is option A.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

Then there's a mention of slide containers and packing advice, which seems to follow the submission process. After that, the speaker moves on to discussing the protocol itself, starting with the word \"protocol.\" This indicates that the next step is to follow the protocol instructions, which involves preparing the slides using the Hema 3 Stain. \n\nOnce the slides have been stained, the speaker provides advice on how to handle them, including the importance of dipping slowly and avoiding shaking the container. There's also a mention of the need to label the slides properly and to use mounting media and a cover slip. Finally, the slides are inspected for quality, and those that meet the requirements are labeled accordingly.",

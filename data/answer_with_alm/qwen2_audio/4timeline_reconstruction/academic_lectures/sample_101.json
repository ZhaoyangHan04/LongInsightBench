    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the sub-events is:\n\n1. The title \"Price Elasticity of Demand\" appears as the speaker introduces the topic and asks whether to raise or lower prices.\n2. A photo of an airplane appears as the speaker mentions airlines cutting prices.\n3. The speaker says \"it depends\" while a power line image shows \"11% RATE INCREASE!\" This implies that the speaker was discussing the price elasticity of demand before mentioning the specific example of airlines cutting prices.\n4. A green screen shows \"LAW OF DEMAND\" while the speaker says the law predicts direction but not how much. This implies that the speaker was explaining the law of demand before showing the visual representation.\n5. The formula ed = (%ΔQd/%ΔP) appears as the speaker notes elasticity is negative. This implies that the speaker was explaining the concept of elasticity before showing the formula.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. The events should be ordered based on when they occur chronologically. First, there is the event where the speaker mentions that ed = -0.7, which indicates that he is calculating something. Then, the speaker explains that magnitude matters and that inelastic means less than one. This is followed by the event where the speaker displays |ed| = 0.7, which confirms his previous statement. Next, the speaker explains that adults' elasticity magnitude is smaller than youths'. After this, the speaker refers to a sign that reads \"GOVERNOR ADDS 10% TAX TO CURB SMOKING,\" which implies that the speaker is discussing the concept of inelastic demand and revenue. Then, the speaker shows text and graphs related to the increase in revenue due to a 15% rate increase at an electric company, which illustrates the concept of inelastic electricity demand. Finally, the speaker mentions that the expression |%ΔQd/%ΔP| > 1, which is related to the concept of airlines boosting sales by lowering prices. Therefore, the correct chronological order of the events is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. We know that the first step is to plot demand and marginal revenue (MR), which is done in slide 3. Then, we have a discussion about long-run monopoly profits in slide 4, where nothing happens because of barriers to entry. Next, we see the upward-sloping, J-shaped MC curve in slide 5, which is an important point. Lastly, there is a discussion about next time being about regulation in slide 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

A second female voice asks about costs as the unicorn turns into a pink dragon and the crocodile turns green (0:00-2:08).\n  2. The speaker lists \"single seller, no close substitutes, significant barriers to entry\" while the Monopoly castle is shown (2:08-3:96).\n  3. A real-life utility pole photo appears as the speaker gives a power generation example (3:96-4:79).\n  4. A hand-drawn graph contrasts ONE FIRM vs_MANY FIRMS as the speaker says itâ€™s a natural monopoly (4:79-6:09).\n  5. The speaker says, \"this type of monopoly is the exception... enough about the atypical monopoly\" over the ATC comparison (6:09-7:08).\n  6. A graph labeled \"D MONOPOLY = D INDUSTRY\" is shown as the speaker explains the monopolist faces the entire market demand (7:08-8:27).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> ",

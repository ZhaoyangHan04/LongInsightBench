The correct chronological order is: First, a male voice quotes Lincoln's 1858 statement as his portrait with the quote fills the screen. Then, a female says historians “resist initial judgements” and asks who Lincoln was talking to; light, hopeful music follows over “$1200–1250 Dollars for Debates” visuals. Thirdly, a female states Lincoln's words are tied to his times while images show “Southern Chivalry” caning and “AFFAIRS OF KANSAS.” Fourthly, a female defines historical context as locating events and sources “in time and space” while a US map and “Claim-Evidence Connection” appear. Finally, over a map titled “Routes of the Underground Railroad 1850–1865,” a female explains evidence-based storytelling and encourages using resources.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

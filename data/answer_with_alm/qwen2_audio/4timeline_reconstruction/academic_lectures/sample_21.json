    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on macroeconomics for help. We see the circular flow diagram first, which shows I = R100m and cY 0.8. Then we see an airport check-in scene, where the speaker mentions that households save 20 cents per rand and contrasts investment (injection) with savings (leakage). After that, the speaker refers to the households-firms diagram and states that total spending has risen by 180 million rand and mentions households spending 80 million. Before describing the next round of income, the speaker asks, “Okay, so what next?” Finally, the diagram updates to show Consumption, C = 64m.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on macroeconomics for help. Let’s solve this step by step. We start with event (1), where we have a persistent ticking sound before the narrator begins talking about equilibrium in the goods market. This is followed by event (2), where the speaker mentions autonomous spending and an upward shift of the aggregate spending curve. Then we move on to event (3), where after a piano interlude, a hand points to a graph titled “THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT.” This is then followed by event (4), where the formula Y = 1/(1-c)A appears, and the speaker says that a 100 million rand investment increases income by 500 million rand. Finally, we reach event (5), where the households-firms diagram shows “A = C + I” and “500m = 400 + 100” as the narrator says investment has “created its own savings”. Therefore, the correct chronological order is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

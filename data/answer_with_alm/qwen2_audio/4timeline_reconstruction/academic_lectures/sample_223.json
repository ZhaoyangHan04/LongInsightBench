Then, a blue book titled \"Inuit Grammar\" appears on screen, and a female voice starts discussing fuzzy criteria for word boundaries. This occurs between (0.69,5.85). Next, two sentences in Spanish and English are displayed side by side with their respective flags. This happens during the time interval (5.82,8.54).

    "model_answer": "I would select option C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 because the events seem to be related in a logical sequence. The speaker first introduces the concept under the British flag, then provides examples, followed by a discussion on possessives, and finally moves on to the topic of language subfields. The upbeat worldbeat music might indicate that the mood of the presentation is lively and informative.",

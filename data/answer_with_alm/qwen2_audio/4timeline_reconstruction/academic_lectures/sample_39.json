This indicates that the speaker is explaining the method being used, which involves measuring the concentration of hemoglobin.\n- A female voice introduces the internationally recommended hemoglobin method over the title slide. This suggests that the video is about a specific method for measuring hemoglobin levels.\n- A slide appears showing the equipment needed for the experiment, including a micropipette and a colorimeter/spectrophotometer. This indicates that the next step is to set up the equipment.\n- A test tube is placed into the colorimeter; the display changes to 0.1454 then 0.3254, and a brief “ding” is heard. This indicates that the colorimeter is being calibrated and a sample is being measured.\n- Red blood is pipetted into yellow reagent in a test tube; a digital timer reads “0:00”. This indicates that the sample preparation is complete, and the experiment is about",

    "model_answer": "The correct order of the sub-events is:\n\n1. A blank graph paper appears and then a plotted standard curve is shown; the speaker explains plotting on Excel or manually.\n2. The OD column is populated in the dilution table for each tube.\n3. A gloved hand pipettes yellow Drabkin’s solution into test tubes as a serial dilution table is shown.\n4. A slide instructs measuring the standard’s absorbance against a Drabkin’s blank and notes the standard concentration is on the kit insert.\n5. The speaker gives an example: an OD of 0.32 corresponds to 14.8 g/dL.\n6. The colorimeter display shows “CAL 54” as a sample is prepared; the speaker mentions using a spectrophotometer and recording OD values.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option D: 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5.",

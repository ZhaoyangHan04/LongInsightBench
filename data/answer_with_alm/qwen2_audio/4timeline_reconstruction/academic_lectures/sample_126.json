    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.\n\nThe video starts with the title \"HOW TO ENGAGE IN CYBER POLICY\", which indicates that the first event is about engaging in cyber policy. This is followed by the orange circle labeled \"APPLE VS FBI\", which suggests that the second event is related to the Apple vs. FBI case in 2016. Then, the speaker mentions Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013, which comes before the surveillance camera shown in the same scene. Finally, the video ends with the discussion of a surveillance crackdown in Kenya and the push for a first data protection law.\n\nThe light melodic music that starts at the end of the video could be used as a cue to indicate the start of the next video topic on freedom of expression. However, this does not affect the chronological order of the events described above.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events in the video is option D: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6.\nThe first event is the speaker mentioning \"FIGHTING CYBERCRIME\" and map targets, which likely comes before any other events since it sets the context for the discussion.\nNext, the speaker quotes from the Universal Declaration (Article 12), which deals with privacy and is followed by a mention of the UN emblem and IGF logo, indicating that the topic being discussed pertains to the United Nations and its involvement in privacy and data protection.\nAfter this, the speaker mentions the concept of \"DATA PROTECTION,\" which contrasts with privacy, and then goes on to introduce the concept of \"agreement\" and the use of buttons to indicate agreement without reading terms.\nFinally, the speaker lists various bodies and forums that discuss privacy and data protection, including the European Court of Human Rights, UN resolutions, and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). This brings us to the last event in the sequence, which is the speaker introducing the title \"THE WHO, THE WHERE, THE HOW.\"\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6",

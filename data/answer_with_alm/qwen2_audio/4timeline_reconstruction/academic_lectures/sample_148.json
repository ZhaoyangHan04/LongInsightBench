    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option A: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\nFirstly, the speaker starts by referencing two-thirds of both houses and three-fourths of all states, which likely refers to the process of ratifying the Constitution. This event is followed by the mention of 36 states, indicating that the ratification process was nearing completion.\nNext, the graph on the screen shows the history of the top US marginal tax rate, starting from around 38% after World War I and rising to about 78% during World War II. This event is connected to the discussion of historical tax rates.\nAfterwards, the speaker talks about the 1920s and the high rates during the Great Depression and World War II. This event is also linked to the history of tax rates.\nFinally, the speaker references the \"Reagan revolution\" and the 35% tax rate, which marks a significant change in tax policy. The screen then transitions to a black title, signaling a shift in topic to constitutional objections to the constitutional amendment.\nTherefore, the sequence of events is: Ratification talk -> Historical tax rates -> Objections to the amendment.",

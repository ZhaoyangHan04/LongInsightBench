This event is followed by the doctor opening a spiral-bound dot color plate book and asking the patient to identify symbols like “zero” and “X”. Then, she explains the swinging light test materials: a muscle light and neutral density filters. \n\nShe proceeds to say she'll induce a left afferent defect with a neutral density filter so the left pupil dilates, instructing the patient to look straight ahead. After this, she notes that on the left, instead of constricting, the pupil dilates slightly. Finally, she begins the ocular motility exam, drawing an “H” in the air with her finger.\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order of the sub-events is option A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

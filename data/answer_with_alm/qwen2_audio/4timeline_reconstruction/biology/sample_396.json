    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. The process described seems to be about diffusion, which happens after the ink is put in the water, so we should start with that. Also, the act of taking a glass of water and looking at the interface between the ink and water comes before explaining the concept of diffusion, so it should be first.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n1. The porous pot is covered and hydrogen gas is supplied to the setup.\n2. With hydrogen, the liquid level in the closed end of the U-tube falls while the open end rises, explained as faster diffusion of hydrogen into the pot.\n3. The setup is changed to replace hydrogen with carbon dioxide.\n4. With carbon dioxide, the U-tube levels reverse, indicating decreased pressure, with a male voice noting CO2’s higher density.\n5. The equation \"Diffusion ∝ 1 / Density of diffusing gas\" is shown as the narrator concludes the inverse relation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

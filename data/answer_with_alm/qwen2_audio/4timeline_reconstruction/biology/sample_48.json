    "model_answer": "The correct order of events is: \n1. The speaker starts by discussing the difficulty and danger of directly counting tigers.\n2. This leads to a discussion about counting tigers using pugmarks, which is shown to be inaccurate due to issues like trampling and double counting.\n3. Next, the speaker introduces the use of camera traps, explaining how these devices work and showing an example of a camera-trap picture.\n4. Finally, there is a close-up photo of a tiger's stripes, which the speaker uses to emphasize their uniqueness and importance for individual identification.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is option C: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4.",

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\nThe video starts by defining population density, which is followed by comparing the population densities of Mumbai and Delhi. This leads into a discussion about the challenges of measuring population density accurately, such as the need for physical counts and the limitations of using formulas.\nNext, the concept of biomass density is introduced, with an example comparing the biomass of a large banyan tree to that of 100 carrot grass plants. This sets the stage for a deeper dive into the topic of biomass density in the following scenes.\nTherefore, the sequence of events is as follows:\n\n  * Definition of population density\n  * Comparison of population densities between Mumbai and Delhi\n  * Challenges of accurately measuring population density\n  * Introduction of biomass density\n  * Example comparing biomass of a banyan tree and carrot grass plants\n  * Further discussion of biomass density\n\nOption A has the first event out of order, Option C has the second event out of order, Option D has the third event out of order, and all three options have the fourth event out of order. Therefore, none of these options correctly represent the sequence of events in the video.",

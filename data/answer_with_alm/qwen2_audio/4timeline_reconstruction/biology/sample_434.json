First, the speaker recites the three main steps of the Western blot: electrophoresis, transfer, and blotting. Then, the title of the technique - Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate PolyAcrylamide Gel Electrophoresis - is displayed, explaining that SDS makes proteins negatively charged. After that, the speaker highlights the transfer step and describes how electric current is used to move proteins to a membrane. Next, containers labeled \"1X TBS\" and \"1X TBS with 0.05% Tween 20\" are shown, indicating that this is the blotting part of the process. Finally, the screen asks \"Why is it called a Western Blot?\" and the speaker mentions Edwin Southern, explaining that it's also called an immunoblot. This completes the description of the Western blot workflow.",

This event is followed by the speaker explaining temperature-dependent sex determination and climate impacts. Then, a light-blue screen appears with the question \"WHAT IS A Western BLOT?\" along with cartoons explaining what it is. After this introduction, the Western blot image labeled \"AMH (60kDa)\" and \"Actin (42kDa)\" appears as the speaker explains how to use AMH bands to determine the sex of baby turtles. Finally, in the lab, the speaker confirms that AMH is present in males and absent in females through laparoscopy, and a male voice responds positively to this finding.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\nOption B: 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3\n\nFirstly, the audio mentions that the speaker will discuss the pancreas, which indicates that the first event should be related to the pancreas. Therefore, we select option B.\n\nNext, the speaker zooms in on an pancreatic islet and labels it with alpha and beta cells, explaining how glucagon and insulin work together. This implies that the second event involves the islet, which is part of the pancreas. So, we select option B again.\n\nAfter discussing insulin and its role in lowering high blood glucose levels, the third event involves an insulin-release diagram showing a blood glucose meter reading of 160 mg/dL. This reinforces the idea that the previous event was about insulin.\n\nThe fourth event involves a pancreas diagram featuring ducts and acinar cells, explaining the exocrine function of the pancreas. This helps us understand the pancreas's role in producing digestive enzymes.\n\nFinally, the fifth event involves a 400X microscope view highlighting lighter-staining islets versus darker acini. This emphasizes the presence of endocrine cells within the pancreas.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 2 ->",

This is followed by a comparison of normal versus type 1 diabetes on slide 4.\nNext, the speaker moves on to discuss the symptoms of type 1 diabetes, including polyuria (选项6), polydipsia (选项5), and polyphagia (选项6). Finally, the speaker returns to the topic of complications of diabetes, specifically focusing on the pancreas and its role in diabetes on slide 1.",

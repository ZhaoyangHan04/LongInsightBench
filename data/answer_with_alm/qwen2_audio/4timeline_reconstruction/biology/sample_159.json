Then, a black-and-white flower titled \"Anther culture\" with a moving red dot is displayed while the speaker explains pollen culture and asks about androgenesis. After that, slides titled \"Androgenesis\" appear as the speaker explains the different types of androgenesis. Next, the title \"Principle of anther and pollen culture\" appears with a red dot on the anther as the speaker describes how to divert normal pollen development into a vegetative pathway. Finally, a slide titled \"Method of anther culture\" outlines the steps involved in anther culture, including using 70% ethanol to clean the tissue.",

A \"Method of anther culture\" slide is shown while the speaker mentions the acetocarmine test and transferring embryoids to rooting medium, with faint crackling in the background.\n2. The diagram \"Fig. 21.2A: Anther culture\" appears as the speaker describes sterilizing with ethanol and sodium hypochlorite and discarding the filament.\n3. The same diagram points to callus and organogenesis while the speaker explains incubation leading to haploid regenerated plantlets.\n4. A slide titled \"METHOD OF POLLEN CULTURE\" is shown as the speaker instructs pressing anthers against the beaker with a sterile glass rod.\n5. The same slide remains while the speaker describes filtering through a nylon sieve and low-speed centrifugation to wash pollen.\n6. A diagram labeled \"Fig. 10.14\" is shown while the speaker says \"2.5 ml of pollen suspension\" is spread in a 5 cm petri dish and notes liquid medium.\n7. On the same diagram, the speaker describes incubating petri dishes at 27-30Â°C under low light and observing embryoids after 30 days.\n\nTherefore, the correct",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\nFirstly, the male narrator describes the structures of the urinary system, which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. This event is followed by a side-view image of the spine where the narrator mentions the location of the right kidney relative to the liver. Next, bullet-point text about kidney functions appears, and a female voice provides additional information. Afterward, there's a change in scene to a rocky island, and the words \"brain break\" are spoken over somber piano music. The final event is a kidney diagram filling the screen as a male narrator explains the anatomy of the kidneys, including the renal pyramids, renal papilla, and minor-to-major calyces leading to the renal pelvis. Lastly, a sunset yoga scene appears with \"urinary system\" and Arabic text, and the narration transitions to a gentle folk song.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is option C: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.\nFirstly, we have the scene of a sunset yoga \"brain break\" with \"urinary system\" and Arabic text appearing over gentle folk music, which indicates that event 1 comes first.\nNext, the male speaker lists the five kidney segments, which occurs after event 1 but before event 3 where he explains how segmental classification helps with surgical planning for partial nephrectomies.\nFinally, the narrator describes ureter length and function, and upbeat electronic music starts playing. This marks the end of event 3 and the beginning of event 4 where the segment ends with a distinct whooshing sound while ureter length is shown on-screen.\nTherefore, the sequence is: event 1 (sunset yoga scene with urinary system), event 2 (male speaker listing kidney segments), event 3 (segmental classification for surgical planning), and event 4 (description of ureter length and function).",

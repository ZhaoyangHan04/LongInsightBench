This is followed by the display of the \"Sexual and Asexual Reproduction\" slide with red annotations, which corresponds to slide number 2. Next, the diagrams comparing protostomes and deuterostomes are shown, which corresponds to slide number 6. This is followed by the transition into the topic of sponges, indicated by the soft synthesized background music beginning at slide number 6. The \"Phylogenetic tree\" slide is then displayed, which corresponds to slide number 2. Finally, the diagrams comparing diploblasts and triploblasts are shown, which corresponds to slide number 5.",

This leads into a discussion about mollusks, such as snails and slugs, which also have gills for gas exchange (slide 4).\nNext, the narrator moves on to discuss echinoderms, specifically highlighting their pentaradial symmetry (slide 5). This is followed by a description of arthropods, where the dominant species are noted to have an exoskeleton (slide 3), and then nematodes, which are roundworms that live on the ocean floor (slide 2).\nTherefore, the sequence of slides corresponds to the biological events being described, starting with the earliest group of animals (cnidarians) and ending with the most recent group (nematodes).",

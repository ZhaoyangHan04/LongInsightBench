    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n1. The speaker starts by describing petals as very attractive and sepals as normally green on the parts diagram.\n2. Next, the speaker summarizes that the pedicel is the part you hold when you cut the flower, still on the same diagram.\n3. On an internal flower diagram, the speaker points out stigma, style, ovary, anthers, and filaments.\n4. The speaker then explains that anthers carry pollen grains, filaments form the male part, and the ovary contains ovules.\n5. A slide titled \"Stamen\" defines the male organ, then transitions to a \"Pistil\" slide defining the female organ.\n6. Finally, a \"Conclusion\" slide summarizes female parts (stigma, style, ovary) and male parts (anther, filament).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

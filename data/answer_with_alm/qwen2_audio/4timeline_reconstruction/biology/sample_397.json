    "model_answer": "Based on the visual elements presented in the video, the sequence of events seems to be:\n\nFirstly, we see three circular images labeled RAM – Male, EWE – Female, and LAMB – Offspring, which appears to occur before any narration begins. This could indicate that these images are meant to represent the different stages of sheep development or the different types of sheep found within a flock.\n\nSecondly, a split-screen diagram of sheep visual fields (Monocular/Binocular) appears, which likely comes next since it relates to the discussion of sheep senses and scent glands. This diagram may have been used to illustrate how sheep perceive their environment using their eyes and other senses.\n\nThirdly, a scientific classification chart for sheep (with binomial name) is shown, which further supports the idea that the discussion about sheep has a factual basis and is related to their biology.\n\nLastly, we see a collage contrasting mostly brown wild sheep with color-varied domestic sheep, which seems to be presented after the previous visual aids. This collage may have been used to highlight the differences between wild and domestic sheep in terms of appearance.\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order of the sub-events would be option B: 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2.",

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is: 5 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6\nOption A is incorrect because the flock grazing in a green field does not follow the sequence of events described in the subtitle text.\nOption B is incorrect because the narration starts with two rams clashing head-to-head, which comes before the discussion of apparel wool and carpet wool.\nOption C is incorrect because the sequence of events described in the subtitle text does not match the order of appearance of the options.\nOption D is the correct answer because it follows the sequence of events described in the subtitle text. The flock grazing in a green field comes after the discussion of the number of sheep per square kilometer in 2010, which is followed by the discussion of sheep breeds, and then the color-coded map of India. Finally, the female narrator lists region-wise breed counts, which is followed by the presentation of breed images and folk music.",

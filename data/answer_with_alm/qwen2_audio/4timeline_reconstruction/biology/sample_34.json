This event is followed by a discussion about propranolol being prescribed for hypertension, which is presented on a different slide.\n\nNext, the slide transitions to a section on anticholinergic drugs, where atropine and deadly nightshade are shown. The speaker explains that atropine comes from Atropa belladonna and was used to dilate pupils. This is followed by another mention of muscarine and its ability to stimulate parasympathetic responses, including pupil constriction and decreased heart rate.\n\nAfter this, the slide shows examples of parasympathomimetics, such as pilocarpine and muscarine. The speaker then discusses how muscarine was once thought to cause Amanita toxicity but has since been linked to parasympathomimetic effects. Finally, the speaker mentions that atropine can increase heart rate and is used clinically, with the deadly nightshade photo still displayed on the screen.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of the events is option D: 2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 6 -> 4 -> ",

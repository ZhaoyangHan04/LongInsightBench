The events should be chronological as follows: The speaker starts by defining vision and contrasting rods with cones on the VISION eye anatomy diagram. Then he goes on to describe the cone pigments which respond to different colors of light on the Retina slide. Next, he explains how phototransduction occurs through the activation of rhodopsin, followed by the unusual effect of decreased neurotransmitter release due to this activation. Lastly, he describes how rhodopsin activates phosphodiesterase to convert cGMP to GMP on the transduction diagram.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

The sequential order of events is that the speaker first describes the structure of the retina, followed by the flow of information through the optic nerve and into the brain. He then differentiates between areas of the brain responsible for processing visual information, concluding with a discussion about the distinction between dorsal and ventral streams.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is option D: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5.\nFirstly, the ASRM logo appears on a white background while a male narrator introduces “Inheritance and mutations”. This occurs at the beginning of the video.\nNext, a definition of a Punnett square appears in black text as the male speaker explains how to construct and use it. This happens after the introduction.\nThen, a 4-person grid shows percentages (10%, 25%, 50%, 100%) while the narrator discusses a “50% chance” and possible inheritance outcomes. This occurs after the explanation of the Punnett square.\nFinally, the title “Autosomal Dominant Disease” appears with a Punnett square showing 100% affected as the speaker explains that only one copy is needed and gives an example of achondroplastic dwarfism. This happens towards the end of the video before the final direction to the website.\nTherefore, the sequence of events is 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n1. A family tree fills with purple/orange gradients while the narrator explains that the mother passes one copy and the father has one chromosome with a mutation in purple.\n2. The narrator introduces monogenic and autosomal mutation types.\n3. A Punnett square displays a 75% probability as the speaker states that the likelihood is reset for each pregnancy.\n4. The title “Sex-linked Mutations” appears with an XY male and XX female diagram as the speaker says “men are XY, women are XX,” noting Y-chromosome mutations can cause low sperm counts.\n5. Under the sex-linked diagram, a Punnett square shows two orange female figures and two purple male figures labeled “affected,” while the speaker explains X-linked recessive conditions (e.g., hemophilia) and female carriers.\n6. Additional sex-linked scenarios are shown with changing percentages, ending with a frame that shows 87%, while the narrator discusses probabilities for carrier/affected parent combinations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

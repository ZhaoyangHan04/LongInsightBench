Then, the speaker states there was “no free oxygen” while listing H2, H2O, NH3, and CH4 in the early atmosphere. This is followed by a portrait of Aleksander Oparin appearing with his name captioned. Next, a portrait of John Haldane appears with his name captioned. On-screen text explains ‘coacervates’ absorbing organic compounds; the speaker discusses this and ends with a brief “hello”. Text cites Haldane’s ‘prebiotic soup’ and a solar-powered primordial sea; the speaker explains the idea. Finally, a title card “The Urey – Miller Experiment” appears as the speaker introduces it.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is option D: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9.\nFirst, we have event 1 where a photograph of Harold Urey appears, followed by event 2 where he describes his calculations. Then, event 3 mentions that the experiment confirmed key molecules of life could be synthesized on primitive Earth, which is related to the previous events. Event 4 notes that the view of a highly reducing early atmosphere was challenged toward the end of the 20th century, which may relate to the topic discussed in events 1-3.\nEvent 5 shows a diagram of the Miller-Urey apparatus, which is relevant to event 2 where amino acids were mentioned. Event 6 mentions meteorite analysis revealing similar compounds, which supports the idea that life emerged from space, as discussed in event 2.\nEvent 7 states that the first cellular forms arose about 2000 million years ago, which is relevant to event 3 where the origin of life was discussed. Finally, event 8 mentions that life arose from non-living molecules (abiogenesis), and event 9 credits roll over chimpanzee imagery while lively, cheerful folk",

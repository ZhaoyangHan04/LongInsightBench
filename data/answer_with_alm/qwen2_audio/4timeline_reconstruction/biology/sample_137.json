Then, the root nodule diagrams are displayed, which is relevant to the nitrogen-fixing bacteria mentioned later in the presentation. Next, the STEM/LEAVES split-screen shows a tendril labeled “Lathyrus,” leading into the discussion of leaf modification. After that, the split-screen “INFLORESCENCE” appears, where the hand pointing to a yellow flower spike is used to define a raceme. Finally, the split-screen “CALYX/COROLLA” appears, followed by the “ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE” slide, which provides examples of economically important Fabaceae species.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n1. The speaker starts by describing alternate, stipulate, trifoliate leaves, which leads us to the first event: (1) Split-screen “STEM” and “LEAVES” shows text like “Leaves mostly compound / Leaves trifoliate” as the speaker describes alternate, stipulate, trifoliate leaves.\n\n2. This is followed by a discussion on leaf modification into tendrils and mentions pulvinate leaf base and foliaceous stipules, which brings us to the second event: (2) A tendril labeled “Lathyrus” appears as the speaker explains leaf modification into tendrils and mentions pulvinate leaf base and foliaceous stipules.\n\n3. Next, the speaker shifts gears to describe flowers as complete and hypogynous, which brings us to the third event: (3) A slide titled “FLOWER:” is shown while the speaker describes flowers as complete and hypogynous.\n\n4. After that, the speaker provides a detailed description of a gamosepalous calyx and ascending imbricate aestivation, which leads us to the fourth event: (4) Split-screen “CALYX/COROLLA” with an “Ascending Im",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option B: 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3.\nFirstly, the title slide with Dr. A. Sai Padma appears, and the speaker introduces herself as a professor. This indicates that event 2 occurred before event 1.\nNext, a slide on the importance of phase variation appears, and the speaker explains immune evasion and TLR5 stimulation. This implies that event 3 happened after event 2.\nAfter that, a slide titled \"Understanding term Phase variation\" appears, and the speaker defines reversible on/off gene expression. This means that event 4 occurred after event 3.\nFinally, a structural features slide with a flagellum diagram appears, and the speaker describes basal body, hook, and filament. This indicates that event 5 happened last.\nTherefore, the events in the video follow the order of 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3.",

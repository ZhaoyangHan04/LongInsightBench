    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n2\\. A title slide reading \"Photosynthesis\" appears as a male voice introduces the process and mentions oxygen release.\n1\\. The Electromagnetic Spectrum diagram is on screen while the speaker focuses on the small visible range used by organisms.\n3\\. After a \"Photons\" visual, the \"Pigments\" absorption graph appears as the speaker says light energy is packaged as photons and pigments absorb them.\n4\\. The \"Carbon and Energy Sources\" slide lists Photoautotrophs and Heterotrophs while a female voice defines both and mentions plant sugar production.\n5\\. A static \"Pigments\" absorption graph remains while the speaker lists chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, and phycobilins.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the sub-events is option D: 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 6 -> 2.\nFirstly, event 3 involves the chloroplast structure where water is split into oxygen and hydrogen ions. This process occurs before the Calvin cycle starts, which is represented by event 4. Then, event 5 shows the variety of pigments found in plants, including chlorophyll, which is involved in photosynthesis. Event 1 follows, describing the light-dependent reactions that use sunlight and produce ATP and NADPH. Afterward, event 2 explains how CAM plants fix carbon dioxide at night to avoid water loss. Finally, event 6 describes the light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle, which takes place in the dark and produces glucose.",

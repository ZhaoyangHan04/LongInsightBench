    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is: (1) The Group II intron splicing slide shows a lariat as the speaker describes the 2' OH of adenine attacking the 5' splice site. (2) A tRNA maturation diagram appears while the speaker explains RNase P generates the 5' end and leaves a 5'-phosphate. (3) The hammerhead slide with a ribozyme/substrate diagram is shown while a female voice explains rolling-circle replication producing multiple RNA copies that self-cleave. (4) On the Hairpin Ribozyme slide, after scientific narration, a brief \"Hello\" is heard. (5) The HDV RIBOZYMES slide with a blue background and green title lists that the ribozyme is 85 nucleotides long. (6) The closing screen appears as a female voice asks viewers to subscribe, like, share, and leave feedback.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

The five-kingdom diagram appears, with a blue circle over Monera and Protista.\n  3. Under the Protista heading, circles for \"ALGAE\" (pond image, traits) and \"PROTOZOANS\" (\"NO cell walls\") appear.\n  4. The title \"PLANT-LIKE PROTIST (also ALGAE)\" and brown algae/kelp visuals appear.\n  5. A close-up of Paramecium with cilia/organelle labels is shown.\n  6. A new \"Fungi-like Protists (slime molds)\" label is added.\n  7. Slime mold images cycle while the narrator explains their characteristics.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\nThe audio starts with the speaker discussing the difficulty in defining common Protista features and deciding to group them based on behavior and characteristics. This is followed by a segment about plant-like protists, specifically focusing on algae and euglena. Then, the speaker moves on to animal-like protists, highlighting the example of Paramecium and its digestive system. Next, there is a section on fungus-like protists, including slime molds, which are described in detail in terms of their nutrition and reproduction through spores. Finally, the speaker provides a full view of the board, summarizing the complexity and intrigue of the Protista kingdom.\nTherefore, the events in the audio are arranged in the order of 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6, corresponding to option B.",

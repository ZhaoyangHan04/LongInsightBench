First, the speaker mentions that some people have a rare genetic disorder which leads to obesity, then he talks about how genetics can be studied to understand the disease better, this is followed by a discussion about different types of genetic variation and their relation to obesity, and finally, there is a mention of a specific study that supports the idea that genetics plays a role in obesity.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nOption A is the correct answer. Here's why:\n\n- The first event is the brief piano melody that plays right after the discussion of Weisst development. This happens at approximately 0:87 to 1:60.\n- Next, we see a small centered square showing the text \"PlayStation VR\" on a black background. This occurs between 1:94 and 2:54.\n- After these two events, the speaker turns to the specifics of human zygotes. This happens at around 3:00.\n- Then, an example cites modern cultivated wheat as a hexaploid species. This occurs between 3:27 and 4:08.\n- Finally, a white \"moon\" appears in the upper right over black hill-like shapes while a female voice contrasts mutation rates in germ vs. somatic cells. This happens between 4:38 and 5:75.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

Then the narrator might explain his theory, leading to event (1). Next, he could cite examples like Dolly the sheep and Snubby the dog, which are used to illustrate his point, moving to events (4) and (2). Finally, he concludes the video by thanking viewers and encouraging them to like and subscribe, which brings us to event (5).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

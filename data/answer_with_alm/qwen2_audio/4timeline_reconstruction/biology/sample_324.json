    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\nThe speaker starts by defining the process of bone formation, which is called ossification or osteogenesis. This is followed by a slide showing bone formation, indicating that it occurs during embryological and fetal development. The next slide is on intramembranous ossification, which is related to the development of the ossification center. While this slide is up, the speaker mentions mineral salts hardening the matrix. Afterward, the slide on intramembranous ossification continues to describe the formation of trabeculae and periosteum, which are spaces for blood vessels and red marrow. Finally, the slide on endochondral ossification appears, which shows how cartilage is replaced by bone. Therefore, the sequence of events is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

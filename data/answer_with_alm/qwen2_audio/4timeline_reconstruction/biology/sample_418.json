    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on clinical knowledge for help. The right atrium is the smaller of the two atria; it receives blood from the vena cavae and the pulmonary veins. The tricuspid valve separates the right atrium from the right ventricle. The right ventricle pumps oxygen-depleted blood into the lungs through the pulmonary artery. The left atrium receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins. It then pumps this blood into the left ventricle. The left ventricle then pumps the oxygen-rich blood into the aorta, which carries it to all parts of the body. Therefore, the correct sequence would be 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on clinical knowledge for help. The Pulmonary Valve is the second valve from the top of the heart. We need to look at it first before we can see the pulmonary trunk which is connected to the right ventricle. Then we need to cut open the right side of the heart to view the inside of the pulmonary trunk. After that, we will be able to insert a probe into the pulmonary trunk and use it to find the moderator band which helps with conduction. Finally, we will cut along the probe to finish opening the right side of the heart, turn the heart upside down, and view the inside of the right ventricle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

The events in the audio go like this: First, a dialogue box pops up; second, the speaker mentions bacteria; third, the screen goes black; fourth, the speaker explains that the exosporium is the outermost layer; fifth, the speaker states that spores are released; sixth, the speaker points out that endospores can survive for thousands of years.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

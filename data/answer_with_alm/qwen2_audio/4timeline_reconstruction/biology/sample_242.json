    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\nOption A best fits the sequence of events described in the audio. Here's why:\n\n- Event 1: Ted is told to use the fine adjustment knob on a microscope, which indicates that he has access to a microscope and is likely in a lab setting. This event takes place early in the video, before any historical context is provided.\n- Event 2: The narrator describes bacteria in various environments, such as air, water, and soil, and shows images of a pond, field plants, sugar being poured into a kitchen, and dry leaves. These events establish the connection between bacteria and their natural habitats.\n- Event 3: The narrator mentions Leeuwenhoek as the first to see bacteria, which provides some historical context. This event also sets the stage for the following events about Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch.\n- Event 4: The narrator explains that Louis Pasteur proved that bacteria cause fermentation and come from other bacteria. This event builds upon the previous discussion of bacteria and their habitats.\n- Event 5: The narrator credits Robert Koch with discovering that bacteria spread disease. This event further expands on the history of bacteriology and its",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the sub-events is:\n\n1. Two men discuss a systematic approach; a title card reads “PARASites SAPROPHYTES AUTOTROPHS.”\n2. The narrator describes parasites as including many disease-causing bacteria; the same title card appears, a microscopic field is shown, and a distinct popping sound occurs.\n3. The narrator defines saprophytes and says saprophytic bacteria cause decay; the title card and a different microscopic view are shown.\n4. The narrator explains autotrophs and that all bacteria require soluble food; a detailed microorganism illustration is shown.\n5. In the kitchen lab, Frank classifies shapes—cocci, bacilli, spirilla, filamentous—while numbered slides (e.g., 32, 33, 46) are examined.\n6. The narrator states bacteria reproduce by cell division about every half hour until food runs out; an animated circular field shows ovals dividing.\n7. The narrator mentions optimal temperatures around 30–37°C as the two men check a cabinet/incubator.\n8. The narrator explains some bacteria form protective spores that later revert to rods; a shiny spherical body appears among rod-like forms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer",

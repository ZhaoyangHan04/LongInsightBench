The events should be ordered as follows: The speaker starts by talking about the nucleus which controls all cell activities; then moves on to the mitochondria, explaining that it is the power house of the cell; after that, he describes the function of ribosomes which makes proteins; next, he talks about chloroplasts; finally, he returns to the mitochondria, explaining its role in energy production via respiration.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

Then we move to the Golgi apparatus, which sorts, modifies, and packages molecules for transportation. This is followed by the endoplasmic reticulum, which assembles membranes and proteins for export. We then see the vacuole, which is a big bubble-like organelle responsible for storage. Afterward, we have centrioles, which control and organize cell division. Finally, we reach the centrioles slide, which completes the tour of mid-to-late lesson sub-events.",

Then he moves on to describe integral and peripheral proteins and how they are associated with the plasma membrane. He also mentions that transmembrane proteins are glycosylated outside. After this, the view changes to show a phospholipid molecule with its hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tails. This is followed by a slide on the Plasma Membrane & Disease, where various diseases related to the plasma membrane are listed. Finally, there is a blue \"Thank you\" slide as the speaker concludes his talk and mentions that the next presentation will be about the cytoskeleton.",

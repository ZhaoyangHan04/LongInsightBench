    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \n1. Day four and planning to pack up in front of the tan tent (saying it's day four indicates this is the first event).\n2. Describing the Kifaru tarp supported by trekking poles (likely occurred after setting up camp).\n3. Moving inside the tent to introduce a Gore-Tex bivy (implies setting up the tent before this).\n4. Discussing the Instinct sleeping pad and using a space blanket instead (occurred after setting up the tent and before using the bivy).\n5. Mentioning using a down vest as a pillow and synthetic options (likely happened during or after the previous events).\n6. Pointing out the tarp's port for a titanium stove and emphasizing its lightweight (likely occurred after explaining the tarp and its setup).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n  1. The speaker starts by complaining about the weight and difficulty of using a Tenzing pack for mountain hunts, contrasting it with his favorite pack, the Kifaru pack.\n  2. He then describes his experience using an Argali pack, mentioning that it has sleeves, a waterproof stuff sack, and a deployable day pack from base camp.\n  3. Afterward, he praises Kifaru and Aaron Snyder, suggesting that viewers check out their gear, including the Kifaru Super Tent and a pack. A bicycle and blue can are also visible nearby.\n  4. Finally, the speaker advises ordering gear at least 6-8 weeks before the hunting season and signs off by saying he's going to pack up and head to the truck.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.",

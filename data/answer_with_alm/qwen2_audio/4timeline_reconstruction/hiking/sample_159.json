    "model_answer": "The correct order of events is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.\nEvent 1: The first event starts with someone saying they hope the wind will hold off while showing a wide mountain-and-valley lookout in bright sun. This must happen before any physical activity begins.\nEvent 2: In the second event, the person mentions being near the south border, saying the trail goes down then up, and is glad to have his cleats. This implies that the previous event has ended and the person is preparing for their hike.\nEvent 3: Event 3 involves the person reporting their distance and skipping a left offshoot, descending steeply into a shaded area as a bicycle sound is heard. This must occur during the hike.\nEvent 4: At event 4, the person turns left to head north and notes they haven't seen anyone today. This indicates that they have covered some distance on the hike.\nEvent 5: Event 5 occurs when the person decides to take a left turn based on a signpost and passes an old dilapidated cabin. This suggests that they have reached a certain point on the hike.\nEvent 6: Event 6 involves the person recommending the hike",

While hiking, he says “ponds are right around the corner,” noting no fish activity as a waterfall/pond is shown.\n3. At a small pond, he lands his first fish of the year and exclaims “Heck yeah!”\n4. Later, after saying he rested an hour and gathered firewood, he fishes a lake and calls a catch “probably the littlest of the day.”\n5. By a crackling campfire, he talks about steak, potatoes, and asparagus and starts cooking dinner.\n6. He says it’s ten o’clock and heads to his hammock; the next morning he says “Good morning… it’s eight” while brewing coffee.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

In the woods, he remarks someone left a little firewood, probably since last year.\n3. He outlines plans to walk to the ponds, find a tree for a hammock, do some fishing, and have a steak later.\n4. After fishing, he reports it was “pretty good,” with “five or six” in the net.\n5. He says a fish isn’t big but is the biggest he’s seen here in about eight years, then plans to collect firewood to cook steak and vegetables.\n6. By a crackling campfire, he says dinner is about 15 minutes away, it looks and smells good, and he’ll relax then use the hammock.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

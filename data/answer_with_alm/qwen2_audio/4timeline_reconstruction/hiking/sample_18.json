    "model_answer": "Answer: D: 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 2\nThe sequence starts with a black screen text detailing \"Scotchman Peak Trail #65\" and a bear-spray warning, which likely indicates that option (4) is the first moment. This is followed by someone remarking on the road being \"really bumpy\" and gravel, which suggests that option (3) comes next, describing the condition of the road.\nOption (1) follows, mentioning a fast stream labeled as at flood stage and a train horn, which could be related to the previous scene or setting. Option (2) then appears, introducing the title card \"Part III: The Snowline,\" which likely indicates a change in location or scene.\nFinally, option (5) describes the speaker being left in the dust but having bear spray, which seems like the logical conclusion to the previous scene. Option (6) concludes the list by summarizing the current situation on the road.\nTherefore, the correct chronological order of the early-journey moments is 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 2.",

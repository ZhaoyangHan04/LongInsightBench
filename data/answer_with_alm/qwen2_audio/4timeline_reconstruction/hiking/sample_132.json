This is followed by event 5 where the speaker reaches the summit and exclaims \"Sgurr MÃ²r!\" and describes the views. Then, event 1 takes place where the speaker admits being distracted by a waterfall before rejoining and beginning the upward path. After that, event 4 occurs where the speaker reaches a junction by a cairn and chooses a third path to the foot of Ben Alligan. Finally, events 6 and 3 happen sequentially where the speaker stands at the foot of Ben Alligan, mentions the sun, points out Ben Jerag, and adds \"big climb... better get cracking.\"",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n- Event 1: He is on the ridge, looking over Loch Torridon, and it's getting dark.\n- Event 2: He reaches the trig point of Tom na Gruagaich and finds out that he has bagged his second munro. The weather becomes overcast.\n- Event 3: He starts descending a path towards the next munro, acknowledging that there is still a long way to go.\n- Event 4: In windy conditions, he faces a steep 10-minute climb.\n- Event 5: He reaches the halfway point of his descent and decides to stop for a coffee break.\n- Event 6: Finally, he starts descending towards the second munro and meets up with Ben, where they decide to grab lunch with a view of the surrounding area. The sky is now hazy.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1. Option B correctly orders the events.",

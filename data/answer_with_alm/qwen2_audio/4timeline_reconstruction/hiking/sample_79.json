The video starts with the person complaining about getting lost while picking berries, followed by his experience at the Sugarloaf top where he couldn't see anything due to fog. Then we have him walking in thick mist using trekking poles, after which he faces issues with blisters and shoulder pain. He then mentions spending the night at Copper Beech House and being dropped off at the starting point. Finally, he describes his last day on the Beara trail towards Keel, including visiting an ice-cream shop upon arrival.",

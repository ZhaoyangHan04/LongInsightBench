This indicates that moment 1 comes first.\nIn moment 2, the person is already outside in a grassy field, saying it's a bank holiday hunt and revealing his first find is a shotgun shell with the detector beep. This means moment 2 comes right after moment 1.\nIn moment 3, the person finds a rusty piece and makes a spaceship sound, suggesting that this moment comes next after moment 2.\nIn moment 4, the person notices a small piece that looks like a Victorian umbrella slide, and somber hip-hop music kicks in. This implies that moment 4 follows moment 3.\nIn moment 5, the person is looking at soil and says the deep target is basically a horseshoe again, with detector tones. This suggests that moment 5 comes next after moment 4.\nIn moment 6, the person is standing by a hedge and complaining about weak signals, saying he’s calling it a day. This implies that moment 6",

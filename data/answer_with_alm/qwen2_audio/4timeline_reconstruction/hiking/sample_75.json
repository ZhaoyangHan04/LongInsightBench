    "model_answer": "The correct sequence of events is:\n\n1. The person starts by saying he's getting his bearings back and will go down for a few more hours to find gold, which indicates that he was already underwater at some point.\n2. He then describes using a cylindrical tool to scrape the streambed, which suggests that he continued searching for gold in the water.\n3. After spending two and a half hours in the water, he mentions that it's getting dark and he'll clean up, indicating that he has been searching for a while and will now stop for the day.\n4. Next, he appears to be in a different location, possibly in his backyard, where he greets someone and mentions that they are back.\n5. He then pours concentrate into a golden scoop and notes that it might be over a gram, suggesting that he has found some gold.\n6. Finally, there is a night campfire burning and music playing, which seems to be unrelated to the previous events.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6, which corresponds to option B.",

    "model_answer": "The correct order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\nExplanation:\nThe first event is when he starts talking about cleaning the box, which likely happened after taking \"a big chunk of creek out of there.\" This is followed by him mentioning that he has been working in the stream for two and a half hours and it's getting dark, indicating that he has been working in the creek area and will clean up later. The next event is him returning to the backyard, which happens after he finishes cleaning up in the creek. Then he talks about how much time he has spent dredging and finding gold, and finally, he announces that he has found his biggest nugget yet while preparing to weigh it. Finally, he spreads powder onto paper before weighing the nugget. Therefore, the events in order are: he starts talking about cleaning the box, works in the stream, returns to the backyard, talks about his gold mining activities, finds his biggest nugget, and weighs it.",

First, he digs up a coin and identifies it as a wheat penny. Then, two men discuss their findings, including tiny aluminum/copper bits that could be from a shipwreck. After that, the sound of ocean waves crashing can be heard, indicating that the search continues. Later, as the sun sets, the person expresses regret for not bringing a pinpointer. Finally, he shows the small finds on a white paper towel, stating that they were not much. The last event involves him planning to search for old silver at an old house site in the future.",

    "model_answer": "The correct order of events is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nExplanation: In event 1, we see a gloved hand cleaning a small round tag with a hole and putting it in a yellow pouch labeled “THE GOLDEN HUNT”. This indicates that event 1 happened first. In event 2, he identifies a skeleton-key type item and discusses it as a canvas latch. This implies that event 2 occurred after event 1. Event 3 involves him on the beach, where he jokes about ice and then finds a wheat penny. Since event 3 comes after event 2, which happened after event 1, it must be the next event. Event 4 involves him noting the sunset behind trees and doubting a find is a belt buckle. This suggests that event 4 happened after event 3. Finally, during the later table review, he mentions a brass tag and a “1924 Wheatie”. Since this is the last event provided, it must be the final event in the sequence.\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

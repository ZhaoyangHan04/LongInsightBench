    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the sub-events is:\n\n1. A standard GPSBabel install finishes; the speaker says, “and there it is running.” This event starts the process that leads to other events.\n2. In File Explorer, the speaker realizes the Garmin is unplugged and then plugs it in. This event sets up the environment for using the Garmin eTrex 20.\n3. The speaker adds formats (Google Keyhole Markup, Garmin GDB, GPXXML) and notes there are now three choices. This event expands the capabilities of the GPS software.\n4. A KML file is converted to GPX with an on-screen success message; the speaker says, “translation was successful.” This event demonstrates the functionality of the GPS software.\n5. In GPSBabel, the speaker says there are “hundreds and hundreds of formats” and opens Preferences > Formats. This event explains the range of supported formats for the GPS software.\n6. A Garmin eTrex 20 shows the uploaded walk on its map; the speaker says, “And there it is.” This event verifies that the GPS software is working correctly with the Garmin device.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4",

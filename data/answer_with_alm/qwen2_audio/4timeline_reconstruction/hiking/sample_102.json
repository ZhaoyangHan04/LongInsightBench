    "model_answer": "The events in the treasure-hunting session seem to be related to discovering various items, some of which are valuable, like jewelry, and others are less valuable, like a quarter or a dime. The chronological order of these events could be reconstructed as follows:\n\nFirstly, the individual finds a toy car that they consider better than a quarter. This indicates that they discovered a valuable item before any other objects.\n\nSecondly, a rusty revolver is revealed in the sieve and examined. This suggests that the individual found another valuable object, although its value may be lower than the toy car.\n\nThirdly, the individual announces that they have found a quarter. This implies that they have found another common, relatively low-value object.\n\nFourthly, they mention picking up a dime and wondering if it's a hot spot. This indicates that they have found another common, relatively low-value object.\n\nFifthly, they read “Amore, love” on another ring, thinking it's silver. This suggests that they have found a piece of jewelry that they initially thought was valuable but later realized was not made of silver.\n\nFinally, they excitedly identify a gold ring marked “14k” while inspecting it. This indicates that they have found the most valuable item of all during their treasure",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n- Event 2: A turtle is lifted in the metal scoop from the water.\n- Event 4: He announces finding a quarter near the swimming area.\n- Event 3: He calls out a “banging 30,” identifies a 1980 coin, and then notes a “12–13” tone.\n- Event 1: He confirms a nickel dated 1986 after mentioning boulders.\n- Event 5: After “nickel” is heard, a rusty key is shown in hand.\n- Event 6: He says a “mostly thirty” signal was just a penny, then dramatic music plays and a treasure-chest graphic appears.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1 -> 6.",

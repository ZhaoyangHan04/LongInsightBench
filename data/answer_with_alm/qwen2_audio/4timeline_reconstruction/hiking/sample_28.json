Then, she points out Western Hillfort/Clevedon while a city panorama is shown (Option 2). After that, she remarks there are no ferns and notes a herd including a bull looking over (Option 4). Next, she laments leaving the camera on zoom (Option 1). Finally, she says itâ€™s a good day after waiting for the weather and mentions cows heading one way (Option 5), and she says the ferns were cut back and that she'll zoom into a view (Option 6).\n\nTherefore, the correct order is Option B: 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2.",

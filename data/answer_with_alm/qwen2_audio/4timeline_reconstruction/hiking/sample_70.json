    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n1. He inventories loose coins from coin balls amid rain, saying he'll save two big ones for last.\n2. Sitting in the field, he explains using two detectors (Deus vs E-Track) and how their tones differ; ambient music follows.\n3. He opens the big coin balls, identifying a ship halfpenny and later a 1956 heatney, reflecting on the good-to-crap ratio.\n4. A glass case of historical bullets is shown while a rock song with lyrics about burnings/Inquisition plays.\n5. More labeled ammunition is shown on a brown surface as the energetic rock track continues.\n6. Credit screens appear; later, heavy rain and two brief greetings are heard before a closing remark, “it's not bad.”\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

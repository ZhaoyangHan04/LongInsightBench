    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the moments is:\n\n1. Hiker introduces Baker Mountain as their first Saranac Sixer beside the trail sign while birds chirp.\n2. A hiker remarks the trail is “pretty much straight up” after a rainstorm as the group ascends a rocky path.\n3. The speaker says they are “over halfway there” and anticipate “hand over hand” up a ridge.\n4. Winded, the speaker notes a steep incline, points out the village of Saranac Lake, and clarifies the visible lake is Lake Flower.\n5. The speaker says they are near the top, jokes about being “Sir Edmund Hillary,” and enjoys a panoramic view.\n6. John identifies himself at the summit marker; the marker is shown with on-screen time info.\n7. They announce it’s time to head down from the summit, later shown as “45 minutes down from summit.”\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.",

    "model_answer": "The correct order is C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.\nThe video starts with a speaker saying they are in the heart of Saranac Lake and pointing out shops with Sixer merchandise. This indicates that event 1 happened first. Then, the bell tradition and its curse are explained at the gazebo, followed by the bell being rung. This suggests that event 2 occurred next. After that, a binder and metal box are shown as a speaker explains signing trail logs for ultras done in 24 hours. This implies that event 3 took place. Finally, an outro voice says the end goal is to ring the bell and they have a ways to go, with a horn sound effect playing over a recap montage. This indicates that event 4 concluded the video.\nTherefore, the events are arranged in the following order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.",

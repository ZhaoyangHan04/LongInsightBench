This is then followed by the activation of Summits on the Air with the call sign \"November one Charlie Lima Charlie\" (Event 4). After that, the speaker shows a gift from Dale (Event 5) and talks about making contacts during the activation (Event 6). Finally, he sits in a car and talks about going to Escudilla Butte for a double run and greets Dale (Event 7).\nTherefore, the correct order is 4 -> 7 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 2 -> 6.",

Then, there's a transition where a man in a yellow cap is seen changing a tire on a silver SUV. This event is followed by the speaker showing a QSL card/photo and thanking Mike from Santa Rosa, naming W6STR / KC6SSE, and notes having sent a card back. The aerial forest shots then roll with upbeat ragtime-style music. After that, the speaker mentions that they drove on a donut to a tire shop, got a free replacement, and decided to \"cut to Mail Call instead.\" Finally, the speaker thanks Ryan from Seattle (NN7M) for cards and invites listeners to send theirs, especially Summit-to-Summit operators.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n  1. The speaker points out big woodpecker holes and explains Warbler Ridge is a sanctuary run by Grand Prairie Friends.\n  2. A gloved hand points at the map's “You Are Here” and the speaker says “we’re here,” debating whether to return or continue as wind picks up.\n  3. The host introduces Parky as the newest Get Out guy and they chat about hats.\n  4. The hiker thanks Grand Prairie Friends volunteers, jokes about a “rock snowman” trail marker, and mentions 7-8 miles of trails.\n  5. While walking, the speaker recounts Simba yanking the leash and then praises him as a good boy.\n  6. A “Trail Starts Here” sign appears; footsteps and a short dog bark accompany banter about a first time on the trail together.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option A: 1 -> 6 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 2.",

(1)\nAt a fork, the speaker decides to go up toward the cemetery rather than down for Warbler. (2)\nThe speaker says to hook a left off the walking road toward Cemetery Ridge Trail and notes some bat houses. (3)\nAmong gravestones with crunchy leaves underfoot, the speaker reflects on people’s ages from the late 1800s/early 1900s. (4)\nHe announces they’ve made it to the other side and picks a “funky tree of the day.” (5)\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

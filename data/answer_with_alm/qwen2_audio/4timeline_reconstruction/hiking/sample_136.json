(2) The camera lingers on the DURANT PARK ARCH historical marker with only wind in the audio. (3) A rechecked plug yields a nickel as the detector beeps, and he identifies it as 1970. (4) He advises to \"always check your hole\" and apologizes for traffic noise near the road.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.",

The mention of 'starting to freak out' suggests that finding the coin was a surprise, but after showing it, he likely felt excited about his discovery.",

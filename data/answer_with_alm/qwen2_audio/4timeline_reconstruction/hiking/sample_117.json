    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the sub-events is:\n\n  1. The speaker starts by searching for 'Harder Kulm' in a browser window (option A).\n  2. Next, the speaker activates edit mode using the hand icon and refines a line by dragging and adding points, while altitude lookup fills any gaps (option A).\n  3. After that, the speaker adds a temporary point on the ridge and starts a 3D terrain view, which they find pretty cool but later decides to undo the extra point (option A).\n  4. In the next step, the narrator begins drawing a rough track from the station and notes that the profile remains empty (option D).\n  5. Finally, the map background is changed to the official Swiss topographic map through a dialog box (option C), followed by entering an elevation value of 814 meters to display a profile on the screen (option B).\n\nTherefore, the correct order is: 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 3.

Then, they use a browser-based Peak Finder view (option 4) to see what's visible from the top and identify the Eiger mountain (option 6). Next, the virtual geocache's coordinates are added as a waypoint with a comment (option 1). After that, the track is exported as a GPX file and saved to the GPS receiver (option 5). Finally, the narrator thanks for watching (option 3).\n\nAnswer: B",

Then, on-screen text defines a pee rag, and the host holds up a colorful cloth and a matching pouch to introduce it. Next, the host references a USA Today article about reusable toilet paper and shows a toilet bowl with swirling water to illustrate the concept.\nAfter this, the host decides to call her friend Mary, who is an OB-GYN resident, for her thoughts on using a pee rag. Mary warns of a higher UTI risk for women due to their shorter urethras but also suggests that a properly sun-sanitized, dry bandana used only for urine might be acceptable. Finally, Mary arrives, and the conversation continues with cheerful banter and laughter.",

This leads into the discussion of sunlight's ability to kill bacteria and viruses (event 2), which supports the idea of using natural methods to sanitize materials.\nNext, the host introduces a product called the Kula cloth, which has antimicrobial properties (event 4). She also mentions the use of UV lamps in hospitals for disinfection (event 3), but notes that relying solely on this method may not be sufficient (event 5).\nFinally, the founder of the Kula cloth provides more information about the product's antimicrobial fabric and how it works (events 6 and 7). This completes the sequence of events in the audio.",

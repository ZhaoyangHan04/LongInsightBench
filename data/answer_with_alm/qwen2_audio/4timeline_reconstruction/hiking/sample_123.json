    "model_answer": "Based on the description, the correct chronological order seems to be:\n\n1. The ranger introduces Indiana Dunes and mentions varied habitats as acoustic guitar music plays.\n2. While walking from the info board, he says “follow me” and points out black cherry bark peeling.\n3. He stops to show purple lupins and yellow pecoons in close-up.\n4. A “Fun Fact” text overlay appears as he discusses prickly pear cactus, after which birdsong dominates.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7\nFirst, we have visual and audio cues from the wooden bridge over the Inland Marsh suggesting that event 1 occurred first. Then, event 2 happened, where he exclaimed \"I made it!\" and explained parabolic dunes, along with a deep croak being audible. This was followed by event 3, where he discussed trail directions at a trail junction with a map overlay. We then hear about their location in the high Tolleston Dunes Oak Savanna and the history of sand mining. After this, event 5 occurred, where he mentioned the Tolston Dunes and West Beach parking lots being built on former mined flat areas. Finally, event 7 happened, where he offers year-round hike advice and credits roll.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\nThe events are correctly ordered based on the sequence of events described in the audio. The narrator first shows the map of the Beare–Breifne Way and outlines Section Two, which leads to Gougane Barra and Millstreet. Then, while walking in the woods, he mentions that he needs to switch off the camera because of his father. After this interruption, the narrator describes finding a spooky abandoned building, followed by his discovery of the green-roofed 'Sos Bharrá' emergency shelter, which he finds lovely. Finally, the narrator reaches Gougane Barra and experiences some foot pain, leading him to decide to stay at the hotel instead of continuing on to Section Three of the walk. Throughout the audio, there are also references to the music and the narrator's feelings, but they do not affect the order of the events described above.",

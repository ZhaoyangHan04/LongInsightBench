Then, on-screen social media handles appear at the bottom (2). The screen cuts to a computer showing Ross's Twitter profile with a Knicks contract tweet (3). A split-screen appears with Sean Ross Sapp's tweet visible while the host discusses a resignation memo (4). The host then reads McMahon's denial from a Wrestle Op's tweet and audibly sighs (5).

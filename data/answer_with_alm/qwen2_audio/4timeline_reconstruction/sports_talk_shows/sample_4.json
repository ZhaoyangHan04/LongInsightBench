Then, we have a scene with the narrator calling Judgment Day dangerous (option D, 3), which leads into a discussion about Dragon Lee's injury and Carlito (option D, 4).\nAfter that, a red \"ANDRE THE GIANT BATTLE ROYAL\" slate appears (option D, 5), and finally, a purple \"THE DOWNRIGHT UGLY\" slate appears (option D, 6) as the narrator critiques the Battle Royal. This completes the chronological order of events in the show.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the news beats is option C: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\n\nThe first beat is introduced by a red title that mentions Triple H preparing us for something bad. This is followed by a scene where the host talks about people nitpicking and the end of an era. This corresponds to scene 1.\n\nIn scene 2, the card “WWE PLEAS ON NETFLIX?” appears on the screen, which seems to be related to the discussion about Netflix potentially having more control over WWE programming.\n\nScene 3 introduces the WWE Draft by showing the podium and the host confirming that a draft is coming. This corresponds to beat 3.\n\nIn scene 4, the host quotes Triple H saying that a new era is coming and that we haven't seen anything yet. This corresponds to beat 4.\n\nIn scene 5, Hall of Fame footage plays, and the narrator praises Paul Heyman's speech. This corresponds to beat 5.\n\nFinally, in scene 6, a red slate appears with the headline “THE ROCK P*SSED OFF WITH FAN AT HALL OF FAME”. This corresponds to beat 6.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of the news beats",

    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: (2) A frantic stands scene where a man says “I got it,” tucks something away, and escapes while people shove. This event sets the stage for the rest of the night's events. (4) Commentary about a “first pitch fastball” and the count building as #99 swings and misses against #29. This establishes the initial action of the at-bat. (5) An excited call of a homer bouncing off the railing into the bleachers, where an away-jersey fan ends up with the ball amid a crowd eruption. This marks the moment when Aaron Judge hit his 60th home run. (1) The speaker opens by calling it “one of the more incredible nights in Yankees Stadium history,” mentioning DraftKings, as #99 stands with a bat pre–at-bat. This provides context for the event being described. (3) The speaker reflects on “Judge 60th homerun,” noting the easy swing, gentle bat drop, and lack of celebration as #99 makes contact and runs. This gives a detailed account of the moment when Judge hit his 60th home run. Therefore, the correct order is: 2 -> 4 -> ",

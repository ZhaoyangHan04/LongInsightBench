    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.\nThe video starts with an outdoor shot of the presenter running in a white tank and bandana, which indicates that moment 1 comes first. Then, a man in a blue cap greets a crowd behind metal barriers, which indicates that moment 2 follows after moment 1. Next, a black-and-white image of a woman running through the forest appears, which indicates that moment 3 comes next. After that, over a shot of a runner in a blue jacket on a paved path with spectators, a brief somber musical cue leads into the narrator, which indicates that moment 4 comes last. Finally, the runner in a blue cap and vest passes the BIG CREEK TRAILHEAD sign as the narrator congratulates “Eor” for returning to the Yellow Gate, which indicates that moment 5 comes last.\nTherefore, the correct order is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

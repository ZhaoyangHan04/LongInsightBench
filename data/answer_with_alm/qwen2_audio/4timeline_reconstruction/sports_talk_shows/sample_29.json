    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is as follows:\n\nFirstly, hip-hop strings play over the screen, which indicates that event (2) happens before event (3). This means that we should select option A.\n\nNext, the announcer declares the final score and the result of the play, which is when event (3) occurs. This means that we should select option A again.\n\nAfter the cheer, the epic music starts playing, which indicates that event (4) happens next. This means that we should select option A once more.\n\nFinally, the commentator makes a comment about the altitude and the length of the kick, which implies that event (5) has already taken place. This means that we should select option A for the last time.\n\nLastly, the announcer confirms that the kick was blocked, which brings us to the end of the sequence. This means that we should select option A for the final time.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 2. Option A correctly arranges the events based on their occurrence time and relevance to each other.",

The crowd is also mentioned at Lambeau, with green-and-yellow on screen, and Matt Flynn doing the holding being noted as the wind is mentioned.",

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is: (4) Early segment: a male notes Frank is shooting well from 3; a female challenges \"how much longer\" after four years. (1) A female says, \"It's not about being a hater... I'm tired of waiting,\" with overlapping laughter; a male adds, \"next man up.\" (2) A male says cut him if he’s not contributing but notes earlier contributions; chill hip-hop plays underneath. (3) A female delivers the Beyoncé analogy after asking \"how much more time,\" while a male counters \"what's another week?\" (5) The discussion emphasizes injury history as the biggest obstacle; the female agrees \"availability is key.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3.",

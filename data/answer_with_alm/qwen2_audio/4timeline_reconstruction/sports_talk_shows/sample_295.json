    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.\nThe audio starts with the narrator introducing CM Punk's UFC debut and a predictable outcome. This is followed by Jake Ellenberger's attribute graphic being shown, which happens while the narrator talks about Gaul submitting him in the first round. Then, there is an armbar locked in with the Round 3 timer at 3:30, which happens as the narrator praises Mickey Gall and mentions he called out Sage Northcutt. After this, we see the on-screen text reading \"UFC OFFICIAL DECISION,\" which happens as the narrator hopes the athlete can try again despite his age. Finally, the referee raises the winner's hand with \"WINNER BY KNOCKOUT\" on-screen, which happens as the narrator notes \"oh and one\" and signs off with \"Peace.\"",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n- Option (1): CM Punk is ID'd on-screen as a former pro wrestler in a packed arena while the speaker says two years of training may not be enough. This event likely happened before the start of the video.\n- Option (2): A tale-of-the-tape style comparison for Punk vs. Ellenberger appears as the speaker talks about a puncher's chance and grappling know-how. This event probably happened during the video.\n- Option (3): The fight begins with a timer around 4:55â€“4:44 visible while the speaker references Punk's post-fight interview and his desire to continue. This event happened after the video started but before the timer appeared.\n- Option (4): On the mat after a takedown, a submission attempt is worked as the speaker laments the quick end preventing us from seeing skills. This event happened during the video.\n- Option (5): With Round 3 at 3:10 and sponsor logos like \"UFC STORE\" visible, the speaker says this marks the end of the video. This event happened at the end of the video.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option (1) -> (2) -> (3) -> (4",

Then, there is a reference to a host drinking water, suggesting that segment 2 follows next. After that, there is a tweet from Nashville Scanner about a man with a colostomy bag, which means segment 3 comes in after segment 2. Subsequently, there is a humorous explosion sound followed by the employee of the week jingle and on-screen title, indicating that segment 4 comes right after segment 3. Next, there is a discussion about community water and straws, which suggests that segment 5 comes next. Finally, there is applause and a pop tune following a story about being upsold into a hot boy outfit, implying that segment 6 concludes the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the segments are arranged in the order: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

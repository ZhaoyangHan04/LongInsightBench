Afterward, the announcer announces that Sherman has struck out, which leads to a roll-off game (option C).\nIn the roll-off game, L.A.X players in red come onto the field and embrace in celebration after their decisive shot (option D). Finally, the next game begins with the scoreboard showing L.A. leading 1-0, with Darren Tang readying on the approach (option E).",

(2) A close-up shows Anthony Lavery-Spharâ€™s 19.1 MPH shot rolling downlane. (3) A commentator calls a player a \"front runner for player of the year again\" just before reacting to a booming strike. (4) An announcer shouts, \" Increases the lead now to 23,\" over loud cheers. (5) Commentator references \"closing out game one\" and says the current ball is \"DOA\" as a miss is noted. (6) The announcer yells, \"Sherman! He strikes out. We go to a roll-off game one.\" (7) The scoreboard then shows L.A. leading 1-0 as Darren Tang prepares on the approach.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is option A: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: (2) A hard rock intro plays as a male voice introduces James Harden and the Rockets’ unbeaten streak. (1) On Open Court, a panelist praises Harden’s passing but adds “not a leader,” and another calls him “a clown.” (4) A commentator says Kevin became the topic due to a critique of Harden; a buzzer sounds at the end.

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\nOption A correctly orders the events based on what is shown on screen and what is said in the audio. The host introduces the discussion about Drew's social media after his promo with CM Punk. Then, he praises Drew's heel turn and promises to get right into it. Next, we see Drew's Twitter handle as he says he must be stopped the day after Raw. A gravestone meme is shown, followed by Drew calling it despicable and noting that WWE posted a Get Well CM Punk message. Finally, a gym TikTok plays, with Drew drinking Prime, petting a cat, and saying it's time to tear up those triceps. The host laughs, then angrily says the person needs to be stopped for mocking injuries and listening to Meek Mill, with the gym inset on screen.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on professional wrestling for help. The original content of this audio is: 'In the sneaker-lit studio, he explains wrestlers using social media to extend storylines and mentions kayfabe. A “Drake” Twitter page with “I used to pray for times like this” is shown as he marvels at the Jordan championship meme. A WWE clip shows CM Punk and Cody hugging while he calls it “evil” and says it gets even better. He sets up a clip filmed yesterday, quoting “Never skip tricep day.” Social handles pop up as he asks viewers to comment on Drew’s trolling and calls it messed up but effective for his heel character. A black screen says “THANKS FOR WATCHING!” as he thanks supporters and mentions a 150k subscriber goal before hip-hop plays. Option B seems to be the most likely answer based on the chronological order of events described in the audio.'",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\nThe narrator starts by mentioning that they are currently in Melbourne for Christmas and that today they will be doing the Christmas Eve hell ride. They then go on to describe their experience during the ride, including passing a BP on the right and giving advice for punchy anaerobic climbs. This is followed by on-screen tips about the push and an upbeat pop song with a female vocalist beginning to play. The narrator then describes an initial pinch and undulating climbs before the song pauses and they loop through a village and begin a descent. After this, the same female vocal track resumes and the narrator mentions a sprint finish, although they say that the memory card missed it while the song is still playing. Therefore, the correct order of events is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

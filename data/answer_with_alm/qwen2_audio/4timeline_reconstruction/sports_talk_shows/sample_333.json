    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \n1. Basketball OT ends: the scoreboard shows 0.0 and the crowd erupts. \n2. Narrator plugs DraftKings after describing a hook-shot tie at the buzzer. \n3. WWE commentator says “Look at the replay here” after noting a missed slap hit the ref. \n4. Referee holds a paper and confers with the wrestler on the mat. \n5. hockey commentator credits player 43’s forecheck/drop-pass and mentions 8,000 fans at the OT win. \n6. Studio host launches “Fan of the Week(s)” and asks viewers to make a choice on a four-tile split screen.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "Option A seems like the most likely answer based on the sequence of events provided in the audio. Here's the reasoning:\n\n- Event 1: Kabaddi caller describes a Pirates raider bulldozing past one Bull, claiming a second touch. This event should come before any score updates or references to other sports.\n- Event 2: The kabaddi scoreboard ticks up following that play. This event would follow after the initial contact between the two players.\n- Event 3: A speaker says kabaddi is “really fun to watch… watch it on ESPN Plus,” then moves to the next topic. This event does not seem to be related to the previous events described.\n- Event 4: Basketball play-by-play calls number 3 banking in the winner. This event comes after the discussion about kabaddi and is unrelated to the previous events.\n- Event 5: The same voice calls it a “wild scene” and notes a baby crying in the stands. This event does not seem to be related to the previous events described.\n- Event 6: A commentator adds there were “9 seconds left” but “nothing” happened, then transitions. This event follows after the basketball play and does not seem to be directly related to the previous events.\n",

Then, during a Yankees-Red Sox game, a fielder drops the ball, and the commentator comments on it. Next, there's a loud \"Bam!\" as Giancarlo Stanton hits a home run, and the Yankees take the lead. Lastly, there's an extreme close-up of an eye reflecting the batter and catcher, and the game is analyzed.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \n1. A man receives the ball after a foul ball, beer sprays everywhere, and the crowd claps. \n2. A gray-uniformed player bends over in visible distress as a trainer approaches, and the audio recounts a puking incident and its cause. \n3. A player argues with an umpire as captions like \"I didn't go on that one\" and \"What the fuck...\" appear, and the audio narrates he was ejected but later gave a signed ball and tickets to a young fan. \n4. A young girl with a big red bow hands a baseball to a fan over the net while the audio concludes, \"good guy.\" \n\nTherefore, the correct order is option C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.",

This order also aligns with the spoken text in the audio.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\nFirstly, a blue cycling shoe insert appears on the screen, and the host mentions that pedals with ample float won't diminish power and asks whether riders should switch to flats. This event corresponds to option (2).\n\nSecondly, a split-screen of two cyclists pedaling is shown, and the speaker states that there's no difference in pedaling efficiency between flat and clipless pedals, even for elite riders. This event corresponds to option (3).\n\nThirdly, a plantar pressure pilot study is shown, and the narrator mentions that clipless pedals actually produce higher, more spread pressures that may help prevent overuse injuries. This event corresponds to option (1).\n\nFourthly, an uphill ride shows overlays (Power ~404 W, HR ~178), and the speaker says stationary tests miss climbing/high-intensity differences. This event corresponds to option (4).\n\nFifthly, an EMG article is shown, and the speaker says clipless pedals have less EMG but the study didn't assess efficiency. This event corresponds to option (6).\n\nLastly, a float design study appears, and the speaker says more float attenuates applied moment without compromising power. This event corresponds to option (5).\n\nTherefore, the",

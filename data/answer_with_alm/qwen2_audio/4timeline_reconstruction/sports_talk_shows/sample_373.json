    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option C: 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2.\nFirstly, we have a female voice sarcastically referencing Adam Silver saying Curry wouldn’t survive the ‘90s, which is event 3. Then, there's a \"COMMUNITY SPEAKS – STANDINGS\" graphic shown as a host says “stop the flop,” asks for opinions, ends with “deflo signing off,” which leads us to event 5. After that, we see a flopping technical foul definition text overlay appearing as instrumental jazz starts, indicating event 1. As players in various jerseys celebrate, a male voice suggests hiring unbiased, quick officials, and brief elevator music plays, leading us to event 4. Finally, we have a scoreboard showing GS 103 – DEN 104 with 4:11 left as a male voice complains about inconsistency and leaning into contact, which marks the end of event 2.\nTherefore, the correct sequence is 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2.",

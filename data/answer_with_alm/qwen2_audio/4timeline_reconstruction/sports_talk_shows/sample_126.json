    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is option A: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4.\nFirst, the on-screen text mentions Russell Wilson's draft profile, which indicates event 2 occurred first. Then, a quote criticizing his height and pocket passing is heard, suggesting that event 1 happened next. After that, the split-screen showing the reader and an Ole Miss QB in a red #10 jersey appears, indicating event 3 took place. Finally, the overlay identifying Luke Kuechly as a Panthers linebacker and the subsequent discussion about inflated tackle production leads to event 4 being the last in the sequence.",

    "model_answer": "Option D seems like the most likely option based on the visual elements mentioned in the description. The sequence starts with a report on Kirk Cousins, followed by a discussion on arm strength and accuracy, which could be related to sports. Then, there's a mention of a calm host telling someone not to get too fired up, which suggests a shift to a more relaxed conversation. This could be followed by a discussion on one-on-one schemes, possibly related to football or basketball. The appearance of a dog in a red jersey might suggest a fun or casual setting, and the mention of a car alarm cutting off a segment could indicate a interruption. Finally, the appearance of a subscribe screen and music at the end suggests that the video is coming to an end or concluding. Therefore, the sequence could be described as follows:\n\n  1. Report on Kirk Cousins' draft status and arm strength\n  2. Discussion on arm strength and accuracy in sports\n  3. Calm host tells someone not to get too fired up\n  4. Discussion on one-on-one schemes in sports\n  5. Appearance of a dog in a red jersey\n  6. Car alarm interrupts a segment\n  7. Light hip-hop music plays\n  8.",

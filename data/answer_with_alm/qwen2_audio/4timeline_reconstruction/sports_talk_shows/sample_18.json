    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of these moments is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.\n\nFirstly, the narrator mentions Florence Griffith-Joyner's biographical details, which indicates that moment 1 comes before all others. Then, the narrator talks about her 1988 100m/200m records, which means moment 2 comes after moment 1.\n\nNext, the narrator mentions the 1988 U.S. Trials 100m in 10.49, which means moment 3 comes after moment 2. This event is also mentioned in crumpled-paper text, which indicates that moment 3 comes before moment 4.\n\nFinally, the narrator shows race footage of the 100m final and close-ups of Fraser-Pryce and Richardson, followed by a headline dated Jan 28, 2024, which means moment 4 comes after moment 3. The narrator then announces Richardson as the \"new fastest woman on Earth\" from Budapest, which means moment 5 comes after moment 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order of these moments is 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order would be option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\nFirstly, we have Richardson setting the world record in Budapest, which is highlighted in the audio clip and noted as one of the five fastest times by the narrator. This event happened before the \"USATF Night of Legends,\" where Richardson received the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Award as a 100m specialist.\nNext, we see three Jamaican athletes celebrating with flags, suggesting that they may have achieved something significant, potentially breaking Florence Griffith Joyner's records. This event happened after Thompson-Herah set her season best and Fraser-Pryce won bronze.\nIn the following sequence, we see a montage of medals, including CR 21.41, which refers to Shericka Jackson's victory in the women's 200m final. This event happened after Thompson-Herah broke her own championship record.\nFinally, the narrator mentions that these records could be broken in Paris, implying that there is still room for improvement and that new records could be set in the future.",

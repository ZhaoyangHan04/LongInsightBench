    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: (3) In the red-walled room, the speaker reminisces about Instagram Live, Chick-fil-A, a 50-piece, and the Larry O’Brien trophy after the title. (2) A webpage showing 2021–22 NBA MVP odds with a “$1,000 Risk-Free First Bet” banner appears as the speaker analyzes Vegas odds and voter fatigue. (5) A split-screen shows Twitter with a ‘Genius_Athlete’ tweet as the speaker quotes lyrics and references a champion’s family. (4) The speaker predicts the MVP race, mentioning Dončić, Embiid with Simmons, Durant with Kyrie, and leaning toward Giannis or Steph. (1) Audio of Kevin Durant from 2017 calling Giannis a “freak” plays while the video alternates to another person on a couch wearing a yellow cap.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 3 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1.",

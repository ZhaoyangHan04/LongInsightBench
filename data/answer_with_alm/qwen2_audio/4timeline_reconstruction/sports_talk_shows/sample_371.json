Then, a split-screen with two players appears, showing text \"I WAS SO SCARRED\" (option D, step 2). This is followed by viewer comments appearing on a black screen (option D, step 3), where the host wishes everyone happy holidays and thanks them for their support (option D, step 3).\nFinally, the host asks for likes and subscriptions, showing a \"5000 LIKES?\" overlay, and then displays \"VIDEO AND Footage Credits\" (option D, step 4). Lastly, he begins recounting his senior-year trip to Jordan's camp in Santa Barbara, and game sounds are played in the background (option D, step 5).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \n1. Jordan was the only high school player there. \n2. In an O.J. Mayo interview, he was asked about being taunted by Jordan. \n3. It's any ball player's dream to play against Mike. \n4. The gym was cleared of cameras and kids were sent to bed, leading to late pick-up runs around 9 PM. \n5. Over gym footage, Jordan and LeBron James are shown talking smack and being guarded. \n6. Players on the court shook hands, and O.J. reflected that he talked smack as a young buck but respected Jordan. \n7. Upbeat band music plays as a speaker says it came full circle and he was later drafted by Jordan. \n8. Jordan made O.J. Mayo regret trash-talking him. \n\nTherefore, the correct order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8. Option B is the correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: (1) The OHMBET title card on a black screen appears with a door-slam-like sound. (2) In front of a red-and-black poster, he says he has an open house tomorrow. (3) While gesturing, he says Kevin is bigger, stronger, and more mature as a fighter. (4) With the single large face-in-red on the backdrop, he says he humbled Kevin and got in his head. (5) He lists teammates by name (Ray, Matt, Aljo, Weidman), calling them family. (6) In front of a backdrop showing two people, he vows he has to beat this guy and recalls a brutal last fight. (7) He concludes a thought saying cardio and the longer fight are in his favor.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.",

The first event mentioned involves two fighters in red and black, which likely corresponds to option A's starting point. As the conversation progresses, we move from one event to another, ending with Khabib flying out of the octagon and wrapping up the interview.",

A slide titled “FA Level 1 - ‘Find a Friend’ Progression 1” appears, and an air horn is heard after narration.\n  3. On-screen text states “Target players can now play to other target players,” as the coach explains the new passing options.\n  4. The overlay changes to “Target players decide on best passing option,” while the coach explains that a target-to-target pass also counts as a goal.\n  5. Players now wear yellow and white, the coach frames it as a competition to make the most passes, and a low-frequency tone ends the segment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

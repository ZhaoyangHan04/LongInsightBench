    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the sub-events is:\n\n  1. An NBA Central MVP ladder tweet with a red arrow and “LOL” appears while the host says Luka’s season is underrated and mentions MVP-ladder snubs.\n  2. An animated season stat card (PPG/RPG/APG/TS%) for Luka is shown as the speaker says only Embiid could be ahead of him in MVP talk.\n  3. The speaker lists Embiid, Jokic, Giannis, and “Shay,” asking why Luka isn’t in the MVP conversation; visuals include Luka in white No. 77 embracing a teammate.\n  4. A career-high vs 2023–24 comparison graphic shows green improvements as the speaker calls the numbers “insane” and notes improved three-point efficiency.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n  1. In a Playoffs-branded presser, the speaker discusses Brunson’s rise and says a dynamic wing/big would fit better next to Luka; an upbeat hip-hop beat follows.\n  2. On-screen text quotes Porziņģis admitting he stayed in the corner “out of spite,” while the speaker analyzes his maturity/health during a Playoffs backdrop segment.\n  3. In a gym clip labeled “SWISH CULTURES,” the speaker rejects the “ball hog” narrative, noting Brunson/Porziļiga were still developing as players and that Kyrie missed time.\n  4. During warm-ups leading to an AT&T/Mavericks presser, the speaker says a typical Luka game is “35, 9, and 10” and laments the lack of recognition.\n  5. A single-speaker AT&T/horse-logo presser features the line that Luka’s shot-making is “truly special,” contrasting modern vs older eras.\n  6. A panel-style presser continues with the speaker insisting Luka deserves more praise and inviting viewers to watch him, followed by a brief hip-hop interlude.\n\nTherefore,",

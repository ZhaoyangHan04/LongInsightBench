    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia for help. The chronological order is as follows: First, the host presents the list of WWE wrestlers who will never win another world title. Then, he starts announcing the names starting from number 8, which is Finn Balor. As he announces each name, a corresponding graphic appears on the screen displaying the number and the wrestler's name. After announcing Jinder Mahal, we see him in the ring holding a championship belt aloft.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia for help. The original text of the audio is: 'The narrator announces Kofi Kingston as the next subject. A red graphic shows “3 Kofi Kingston.” The narrator announces the next subject, Rey Mysterio. A red graphic displays “2 REY MYSTERIO.” A red graphic displays “1 JOHN CENA.” The presenter signs off, saying he'll see listeners next time with more wrestling content.' Options (B) and (C) are the most likely choices since they match the sequence of the on-screen title cards and the narration. Option (A) has Kofi Kingston appearing after Rey Mysterio, which is incorrect according to the audio. Option (D) has John Cena appearing last, which is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

This is then followed by his observation that what happened was scary and real. The next part of the speech involves the speaker addressing those who only look at statistics and mentions the Ravens holding the team to one touchdown. After this, he talks about the Ravens being wide open and mentions two dropped touchdowns and a deep pass, referencing coaches asking how to defend them. Finally, the speaker concludes by saying that the Ravens were the best defense against themselves and hoping that their coach gets a head coaching job. As he signs off, he appears in a black hoodie labeled \"RAVENS\".",

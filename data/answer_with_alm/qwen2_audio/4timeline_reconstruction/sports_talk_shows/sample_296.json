    "model_answer": "Option B seems like the most likely order based on the flow of events described in the audio. Here's a possible timeline that aligns with the options:\n\n  * (1) The host welcomes the audience and sets the stage for the show.\n  * (2) We hear about a message from Hangman Page, which may have been introduced before the show started.\n  * (3) The match between Marty Scurll and Hangman Page is announced, followed by the introduction of another match featuring Kushida and Tanahashi.\n  * (4) The speaker then threatens to make a dramatic entrance, possibly during the intermission or after the first match has ended.\n  * (5) A announcement is made about Bullet Club coming to San Francisco, which may be related to the previous segment or a separate event.\n  * (6) Finally, the host reveals the main event of the night, which is Kenny Omega defeating Okada.\n\nThis order aligns with the flow of information provided in the audio and makes sense logically. However, without more context or specific details, it's difficult to say for certain which option is the correct one.",

This could lead into a segment showcasing a match or event that has significant importance to the club or its members (option 6). Finally, the show could conclude with a closing statement or tribute (option 7).\nIt's worth noting that the specific details and order of the events may vary based on the length and structure of the show.",

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\nThe video starts with an on-screen tweet showing Andre Onana's farewell to Ajax, which is accompanied by the host quoting \"the journey ends here.\" This event is followed by the host questioning whether Chelsea can afford to have Onana alongside another goalkeeper.\nNext, the host talks about normalcy returning to football and how it's important to understand goalkeeper moves. He speculates that Onana might move to the Premier League. Then, with @FOOTBALLYANNICK visible and light electronic music playing, the host cites Lampard saying that Chelsea need a forward and dismisses tabloid rumors.\nAfter this, there is an upbeat musical intro, and a cutaway to a player in a white jersey celebrating. The host then discusses Moussa Dembélé's links. Finally, the end screen appears, and a rap track starts as the outro.\nTherefore, the events in the video follow the sequence of 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

In the arcade, a voice boasts, \"I'm a pinball wizard,\" pointing out a row of pinball machines.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5\nOption B is the correct answer. Here's why:\n\n- Event 1: A deep voice says, \"Ar, it's a pirate's life for me\" beside a pirate statue. This indicates that we are in a location related to pirates.\n- Event 3: The Donkey Kong title screen appears as a woman says she loves Donkey Kong. This tells us that the location might be related to video games, specifically Donkey Kong.\n- Event 2: Inside the arcade, a man exclaims, \"I'm a pinball wizard,\" next to a row of pinball machines. This confirms that we are still in an arcade setting.\n- Event 4: A fortune teller behind glass advises to keep your mouth shut and invites a return. This could suggest that we have left the arcade and gone to another location, possibly a fortune teller's stand.\n- Event 5: Avocado asks viewers to subscribe and says goodbye over upbeat electronic music. This indicates that the final event took place after the other events and was recorded separately.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events is: We start at a location related to pirates, move to a video game",

    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: (1) She says the Airbnb has no nightlight and heads into bed. (2) She says goodnight nervously as ominous strings begin. (3) A chilling scream and falling noises are heard in the night. (4) An alarm clock rings; she praises the \"immaculate\" morning sunlight. (5) \"LET'S MAKE B-FAST\" appears; a jump-scare sound makes her scream in the kitchen. (6) A 'TICKET ADMIT ONE' graphic is shown as she says she booked a resort ticket and called an Uber. (7) She shows her pink-and-white \"snow bunny\" outfit and announces the Uber has arrived. (8) On a ski lift, she says her goal is a higher lift; a crash sound effect interrupts. (9) While skiing, she shouts \"wrong way\" amid crashes and then says, \"How did I survive that?\" (10) While skiing away, she asks viewers to subscribe, says she needs redemption, and jokes about security cameras as social handles and a Bible quote are on-screen.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8",

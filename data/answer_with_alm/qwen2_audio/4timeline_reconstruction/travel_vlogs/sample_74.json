    "model_answer": "We know that Paulie found a gold nugget, which happened after he was looking for it, so we can place that at the end, after all other events. We also know that he had to maneuver with a long pole, which suggests that he was already in the water, possibly searching for something, before finding the nugget. Therefore, the correct order is:\n\n1. He comments, \"the current is strong.\"\n2. He exclaims, \"found a nice little nugget.\"\n3. The underwater camera shows him maneuvering with a long pole between rocks.\n4. A gloved hand holds up a small gold nugget to the camera underwater.\n5. He gives a tip that cracks running with the river hold gold and encourages watching to the end.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option D: 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "The correct order of events is: Paulley starts by explaining his search for bedrock exposures and cracks where gold gets stuck (1), then he finds a patch of bad rock almost immediately (2). This leads him to struggle to balance at a crevice (3), which causes the on-screen text \"OH\" to appear. After this, he mentions that they have started at a gold-loaded crevice and comments on the camera quality (4). Finally, he acknowledges the changing weather and jokingly suggests that finding more gold will cure gold fever (5). As the light fades, they make their way downstream (6).\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 4 -> 2 -> 6 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5.",

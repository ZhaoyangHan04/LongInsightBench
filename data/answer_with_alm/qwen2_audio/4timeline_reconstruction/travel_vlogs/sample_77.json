This event is followed by a final boarding call for a JAL flight to Delhi, implying that the passengers have reached the gate.\nNext, there's a celebratory toast with champagne, which suggests that the passengers might be celebrating something before boarding the plane.\nAfterwards, a flight attendant assists with the seat and asks not to take pictures while pressing a seat control. This implies that the passengers are now on the plane and seated.\nFinally, there's an upbeat pop song playing and someone mentioning it's their “big 60th country,” which indicates that the plane has taken off and is in the air. The last event recorded is the speaker praising Chef Yuji Kurogi’s business-class menu, which implies that the meal service has begun.\nLastly, there's an engine noise growing louder, which indicates that the plane is making its way overland. This event happens after all the previous ones listed, hence it would come last in the sequence.",

Then, event (3) must occur after event (2), since she is describing their arrival in Arizona in the morning.\nEvent (4) cannot come before event (3), as she would not have had her shoes tied and mentioned her wallet, phone, and mask if she was already in Arizona. Similarly, event (5) cannot come before event (4), as she would not know which gates to go to if she did not arrive at the airport yet.\nFinally, event (6) comes last, as it is the only event that occurs after all the other events have taken place.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \nShe says, \"We only got like an hour of time to kill,\" while seated and putting in earbuds (1). \nShe says, \"Here we go,\" as engine noise revs; she stands, pulls her suitcase, and walks through the airport (2). \nOnboard, intercom announcements cover exit-row rules and not forgetting personal items while she adjusts her mask (3). \nIn flight, the camera shows the wing with clear skies while electronic synth music plays and she reads a book (4). \nAfter landing, she calls saying, \"I'm in terminal 3... coming out to parking,\" while following signs to ground transportation (5). \nOutside, she remarks about the heat and humidity, greets someone, and a car door closes (6).\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nEvent 1 sets the stage by introducing the concept of a backseat organizer, which implies that the discussion will be about preparing for a road trip. Event 2 builds upon this by introducing the topic of safety, specifically focusing on tires. This indicates that the second event is related to the first one and emphasizes the importance of tire preparation for a road trip. Event 3 provides context for the importance of tire safety by describing a real-life scenario where helmeted riders experienced tire slippage on a wet test track. Event 4 reinforces the idea of tire safety by explaining the penny test as a way to check tire tread depth. Finally, Event 5 ties all the events together by showing how a preparedness app can help users access expert checklists and use a complete vehicle kit, thereby completing the loop of preparing for a safe road trip.\nTherefore, the correct order of events is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5",

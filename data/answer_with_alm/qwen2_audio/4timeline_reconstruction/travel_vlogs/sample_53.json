This indicates that event 1 comes first. Then, during the drive to the donut shop, a rider points out Longs Peak and makes a joke about 30 more donuts. This suggests that event 2 happened next.\nAfterward, there's a description of riding along a green path and encountering prairie dogs, which indicates that event 3 occurred. Finally, when they arrive at the Voodoo Donuts store, they see the pink walls and sit outside enjoying donuts from a pink Voodoo box. This implies that event 5 happened last.\nTherefore, the correct sequence is 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "The correct order of events is option D: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6.\n\nFirstly, there is an energetic voice saying \"Dina, wake up, it's time to get donuts!\" This indicates that event 1 happens first. Then, a woman explains the \"safer at home\" approach, and a man adds that any day they can ride bikes is a good day. These events occur simultaneously, so we place them next to each other without an order.\n\nAfter that, the group remarks on the cloudless Colorado sky and mentions a jet stream while standing on the path. This suggests that event 3 takes place after event 2.\n\nNext, the rider says the route is easy to follow with \"signs everywhere\" as a US 36 Bikeway sign is shown. This implies that event 4 comes before event 5.\n\nFinally, sitting on steps with a pink donut box, the rider recaps lollygagging with prairie dogs and says they're happy with donuts. This indicates that event 6 follows event 5.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6.",

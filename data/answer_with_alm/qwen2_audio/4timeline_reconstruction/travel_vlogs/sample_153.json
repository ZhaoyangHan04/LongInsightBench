They then proceed to discuss the location of an 'escape hatch' and point out its label, indicating that this was their first action upon entering the cockpit.

This event likely comes after discussing the shore power and galley, so it would be placed next in the sequence.\n  * Finally, there's a launch of a joinery photo challenge and a sign-off message.

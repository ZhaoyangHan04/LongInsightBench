    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option A: 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 1.\n\nFirstly, she says goodbye as a \"SUBSCRIBED Klailea\" graphic appears and the screen turns blue, which indicates that this was the first visual element shown. This is followed by her demonstrating a touch-activated light, which suggests that she moved on to explaining another feature after saying goodbye.\n\nNext, an older woman explains how the reed diffuser works, which comes next in the sequence. This provides context for the touch-activated light demonstration she had just completed.\n\nAfter explaining the reed diffuser, she then dances joyfully in front of the mirror in her room, which indicates a change in setting or location from the previous scene.\n\nFinally, she introduces her dad, who hands her a lighting remote and suggests mood lighting. This completes the sequence, as she has now demonstrated two different features and received assistance from her father.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as follows: She says goodbye, demonstrating a touch-activated light, an older woman explains the reed diffuser, she dances joyfully, and she introduces her dad.",

Then, there's a conversation inside the car about RV park plans and costs (event 3). After that, there's a scene where they're looking at a screen with information about a tire monitoring system (event 4). Finally, there's a split-screen showing Matt on the phone in the camper while they talk about getting a pop-out leak handled under warranty (event 5).\nTherefore, the sequence of events is: they find the turtle, then discuss plans and costs, check tire information, and end by talking on the phone.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \n1. Inside the RV, text notes a pop-out leak while Matt says drop-off could take “a day or two.” \n2. Seated together, Matt says fixing the slide-out instead of buying an awning saved about $300. \n3. They compare prior rent around $1050 to current payments while dogs are shown lounging. \n4. They talk about money as a tool and mention buying trailer items and tickets to Disney World, joking about sneaking in their dogs. \n5. They clarify it’s the pop-out (not the awning), and Matt adds he’ll wash the outside soon. \n6. “THANK YOU FOR WATCHING” appears as they sign off and the playful piano theme begins.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

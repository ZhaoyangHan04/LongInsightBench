    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on world religions for help. The original text of the audio does not specify the sequence of events, so we cannot determine the correct answer with certainty. However, since all events involve food, itâ€™s possible that the sequence could be related to meal preparation or sharing. We select option C because it has the earliest event (meeting each other), followed by adding ingredients to the hot pot, which seems like the next step in preparing a meal. Afterward, they might have taken a photo at the Samurai Museum, which led them to discuss Japanese culture and food further. Next, they discovered their shared heritage through their kimonos, and then possibly bonded over their love for Japanese cuisine, leading them to recommend each other's favorite places to eat. Finally, they ended up discussing their social media presence and daily diets, which brings us full circle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option A: 5 -> 1 -> 7 -> 3 -> 6 -> 2 -> 4.\n\nFirstly, they mention Bordeaux and how it's quieter and closer to the sea, which comes first in the sequence (option A). Then, they suggest going to see the south of France, which likely follows (option 5). After that, they show an image of Saint-Tropez and mention Monaco, which indicates that this comes next (option 3).\n\nNext, they discuss the protests that started after a gas price hike was announced by the president, which happens later in the sequence (option 4). Finally, they recommend Eiffel Tower and Montmartre, followed by suggesting strolling with coffee and red wine, which brings us to the end of the list (options 6 and 7).\n\nTherefore, the correct order is 5 -> 1 -> 7 -> 3 -> 6 -> 2 -> 4.",

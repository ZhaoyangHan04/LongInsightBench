This is followed by him going to the gift shop and seeing Godzilla merchandise on display. Then, he talks about ordering a tissue holder and discovering that the strawberry Shin Godzilla head is sold out, but finding happiness in the Baby Godzilla hotdog. Next, he describes trying the Godzilla footprint curry with chili oil, after which the Mothra plate appears and there's a loud glass-shatter sound.

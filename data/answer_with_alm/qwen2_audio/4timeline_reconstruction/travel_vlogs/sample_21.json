    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4\nFirstly, on-screen text appears suggesting the use of shower curtains for privacy during a road trip. This is followed by a personal anecdote from the speaker about experiencing temporary morning hair like Chewbacca due to lack of privacy in a Walmart parking lot. Then, the speaker addresses the issue of summer ventilation and being bitten by mosquitoes while traveling, calling them \"little buzzing demons.\" Lastly, the video shows close-up footage of adjusting a car window screen to keep bugs out, which concludes the sequence.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\nThe first event is the speaker warning about the messiness of a mobile home getting \"gnarly so fast\" without proper organization. This sets the stage for the importance of organization.\nNext, on-screen text appears with the message \"Road Trip Tip: Organization = Sanity. Use bins!\" This reinforces the idea of the importance of organization for a road trip.\nA blue HDX storage tote is then shown outdoors, which may suggest that the speaker is demonstrating how to use bins for organization.\nThe fourth event is the speaker explaining that the sleeping platform was designed around bins to slide them in/out and avoid hangry situations. This provides additional context for the use of bins.\nFinally, the fifth event shows a person packing blue bins into a silver SUV, which implies that the speaker has demonstrated the use of bins for organization and it's now time to pack.\nThe last event is the speaker stating that the setup cost \"around $200\" and mentioning seeing a similar setup in a Honda Fit. This provides some financial context for the setup but does not directly relate to the chronological order of the events described above.",

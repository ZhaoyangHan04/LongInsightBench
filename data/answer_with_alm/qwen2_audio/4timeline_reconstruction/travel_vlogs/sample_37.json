After these initial comments, she mentions that some people combine buses, private drivers, and taxis, suggesting that this can reduce their freedom.\n5. Finally, she advises taking photos of existing scratches and checking \"the marks\" on a rental car before signing.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

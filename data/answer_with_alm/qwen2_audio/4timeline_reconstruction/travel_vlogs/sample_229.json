    "model_answer": "The correct order of the immigration sub-events, based on the provided visuals and narrative, is:\n\n1. The individual arrives at the airport and has an \"ENTRY REFUSED\" stamp placed over a map. This event likely occurred first, followed by the argument about the visa and the subsequent negotiation for additional time.\n2. The individual contacts someone named Mal and discusses the damage to his car. This event may have occurred before or after the previous events, but it seems to be separate from the main immigration process.\n3. The individual is searched by officers with dogs at the airport terminal. This event occurs during the individual's time at the airport, possibly while they are waiting for their visa or trying to find a way out of the country.\n4. The individual applies for a 60-day tourist visa at a counter. This event likely follows the previous events, as the individual needs a visa to leave the country.\n5. A female officer at the counter objectifies the individual's desire to live with a Thai girl without marriage and insists on a retirement visa instead. This event likely occurred after the individual applied for the tourist visa, but before the final decision was made.\n6. The individual becomes frustrated with the limitations on their credit cards and is told to withdraw cash and purchase",

This indicates that her journey has begun.\nLater, while backstage at the event, she introduces Layla, which suggests that this event is related to her trip.\nIn the car on the way to Disney World, she notices a plane writing 'Jesus' in the sky, indicating that this event took place before her visit to Disney World.\nAt Disney Springs, they discuss the plane writing 'Jesus' in the sky and then mention seeing a plane writing 'Stranger Things' in the sky. This implies that they visited both places after each other.\nAfter visiting Universal Studios, where they were terrified by a house from 'Stranger Things', they mention heading to the airport. Finally, in a hotel lobby selfie, they confirm that they have just arrived at the airport.\nTherefore, the events in the timeline follow the sequence of her journey from the airport to Disney World, then to Disney Springs, followed by Universal Studios, and ending back at the airport.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n3 -> 5 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 6\n\nExplanation:\nThe video starts with lemon sharks being described as docile while sharks glide underwater (event 3). This is followed by someone saying they're ready to go for tomorrow as a woman handles a coconut (event 2). Then, the man says he'll jump in and then dives into the water (event 3).\nAt night, a man says it's time to get the sail up and strains while hoisting (event 4). After that, we see a water skier performing a jump at sunset and someone exclaiming it was \"sweet\" (event 5). Finally, inside the cabin, the man thanks viewers and says goodbye, noting it might be rolly/bumpy (event 6).\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 6.",

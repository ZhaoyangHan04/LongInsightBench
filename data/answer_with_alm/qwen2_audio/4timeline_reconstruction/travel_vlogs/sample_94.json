    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5\nExplanation: The first event mentioned is that the speaker will share a weekend in her life at a family reunion, which happens at the beginning of the clip. This is followed by the mention of heading to the boat, implying that they are leaving their current location. Then, they go to a local tavern, which is visited annually. Next, there is a countdown and the sound of dominoes tumbling, which indicates that they are likely at a party or gathering. Finally, family members say their goodbyes and someone asks to say goodbye to the vlog, which implies that they are finishing up filming for the day. Therefore, the events happen in the order of 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.",

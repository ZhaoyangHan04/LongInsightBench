From (4), a woman announces their arrival, confirming that they are indeed in Haiti. Then, from (5), we hear music and children playing, indicating that they are at the beach in Labadee. Finally, from (1), we learn about their activities earlier in the day, including taking a hike and dealing with the heat by leaving the stroller behind.\nTherefore, the sequence is as follows: They arrive in Haiti, go to the beach, take a break, and then return to the ship where they discuss their activities of the day.",

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7\nFirstly, she mentions \"disappointments on disappointments\" and that Rupram is closed, which indicates that this event happened first. Then, she almost gets hit by a car and reacts, which must have occurred next. After that, the camera shows inside a moving bus at sunset with palm trees outside, suggesting that she was already on the bus during the incident. She then mentions that she missed her bus stop because she was filming the sky that turned purple, indicating that this happened after the previous events. Next, she checks a passing car and notes it isn't her taxi, which implies that she has been looking for her taxi. Finally, she takes a styrofoam box with roti out of a blue bag, and then she says she forgot to end the vlog yesterday and asks viewers to subscribe. Therefore, the sequence is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.",

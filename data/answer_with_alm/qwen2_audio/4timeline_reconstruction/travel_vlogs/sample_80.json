Then, in a car seat, she excitedly describes her cold-weather outfit for freezing Ireland. After that, outside the car, she pulls a pink suitcase and boards a shuttle bus after saying they'll park and go to the airport. At the airport, she says they got through security and debates mango vs pomegranate at a smoothie place. While waiting at the gate with snacks, she enjoys a pineapple-mango smoothie and then says \"we're boarding\" as an intercom wishes a nice flight. Finally, on the plane, she sits with a neck pillow and exclaims theyâ€™re going on the flight as airplane noise starts.",

Afterward, she describes how they arrived at the airport, including getting into the car, driving on the snowy driveway, and making it to the airport lines (option 3). Next, she mentions that they made it through security and cheered \"we're going home, hurray!\" (option 4), followed by ordering food at Burger King (option 5). Finally, on the plane, the wing takes off, and later she comments on it being lunchtime and joking about melted chocolate on her seat (option 6).

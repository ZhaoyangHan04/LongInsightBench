    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option B: 3 -> 7 -> 2 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 8.\nThe audio starts with someone talking about cheesets and eating them, which can be associated with moment number 3. Then there's a mention of a “Miss Frizzle!” and taking a picture, which could be linked to moment number 2.\nAfter that, there's a reference to caffeine and going to Starbucks, which might be connected to moment number 7. This is followed by a playful exchange and a slow-motion fight scene, which could correspond to moments number 4 and 5.\nFinally, there's a mention of a TV showing something related to Hilton, which could be linked to moment number 6. The audio ends with voices chanting and dancing, which could be associated with moment number 8.\nTherefore, the sequence goes from someone talking about food (moment 3), taking a picture (moment 2), referencing caffeine and going to Starbucks (moment 7), having a playful fight scene (moment 4 and 5), seeing something on TV (moment 6), and ending with people chanting and dancing (moment 8).",

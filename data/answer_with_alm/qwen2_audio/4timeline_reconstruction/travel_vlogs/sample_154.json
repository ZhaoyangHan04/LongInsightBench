At second 3, the scene transitions to a bustling Johannesburg city street. In between, at second 4, the man is seen holding the woman's hands while discussing being asked for a return ticket. Finally, at seconds 5 and 6, the woman thanks the viewers and the male host encourages them to like, share, and subscribe to the channel.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on world history for help. South Africa gained independence in 1994, so it would make sense that the first event recorded is about South Africa post-independence. Then, it could be related to international travel, followed by events in a specific country. Therefore, the answer is A: 4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

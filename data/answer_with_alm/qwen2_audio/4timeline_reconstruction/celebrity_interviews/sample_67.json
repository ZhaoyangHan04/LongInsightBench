    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on interior design for help. Kendall Jenner's house has a tranquil courtyard, which comes first in the timeline. Then we move to the rooms that were actually described in the article. The kitchen is the place where she cooks with friends daily, so it should come right after the courtyard. The formal living room is described as having no TV and a low-key vibe, so it should come next. The movie theater is then mentioned, but it was converted into an art studio, so its location is unclear. The master bath makeover is highlighted with a massive brass tub, so it should come right after the living room. Lastly, the backyard's pool, spa, and lawn are described with easy outdoor access via glass doors, so they should be last.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

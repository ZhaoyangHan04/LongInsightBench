    "model_answer": "The correct order is: (1) -> (2) -> (3) -> (4) -> (5) -> (6) -> (7)\nThe first event is introduced as \"SiriusXM Urban View studio visuals,\" which likely comes before any commentary. Then, there's a female speaker who criticizes Wendy Hunter and ends with a cliffhanger. This is followed by a narrator wishing Megan well and transitioning to a new topic. Next, we see visuals related to Megan Thee Stallion's Instagram spat with her makeup artist. A black screen then appears with a message about artists being paid and tagged. Finally, the narrator highlights Megan's later post acknowledging the collaboration and gratitude, and the speaker closes off the discussion by asking for opinions on competitive energy.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\nFirst, a man places a coin on the \"NEW EDITION\" star, which is followed by crowd chatter and a voice plug for liking/sharing/subscribing. Then, a man in a BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL shirt approaches and introduces himself as \"your roving reporter, Big Ron Devo.\"\nNext, an adult prompts a child to read a star, and the child excitedly confirms that it says \"New Edition.\" This is followed by a busy sidewalk scene where people talk about taking a picture during a livestream and a child calls for their father.\nFinally, the family sits by a star, and someone counts down \"one, two, three,\" with directions like \"look up\" and \"point to it.\"",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is: \n1. The man speaks to camera about heading to the airport, greeting people by name.\n2. He complains \"it's hot as hell out here,\" references his \"Black Fathers, Black Leaders, Black King\" shirt, and asks for a towel.\n3. Multiple voices banter; someone asks if a person is trying to take Beyonce's man, someone looks up at the sky, and a woman says \"ouch\" because a boy is pulling her.\n4. The couple talk about significant dates, then a child asks to go to the car.\n5. The man says he needs \"some AC,\" mentions \"we in Cali,\" and talks about going into \"caterpillar mode\" as melancholic piano plays and the video ends to a black screen with text.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

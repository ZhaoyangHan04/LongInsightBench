    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: (1) The host cues the clip, asks Jackson Wang fans to like, and a glitchy transition sound plays. (2) Onstage, bilingual subtitles appear as the artist complains about media gossip while the crowd cheers. (3) A commentator mockingly asks, “Is she an alcoholic?” after noting drinking on stage. (4) A speaker claims the West only allows mentioning the “bad parts about China,” saying the person only shared “a little bit of good things.” (5) The hosts say the backlash came from his delivery and drinking on stage, not just the content.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

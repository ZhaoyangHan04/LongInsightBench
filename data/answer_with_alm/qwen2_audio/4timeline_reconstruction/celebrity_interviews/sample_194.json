    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n  1. A woman stands beside a black car in a sunny parking lot and says they’ll both perform at the “Trap Festival.”\n  2. In a crowded outdoor area, security restrains someone on the ground while a man shouts about tasers and tells people to leave.\n  3. On a dimly lit livestream, a speaker angrily declares she is “untouchable” and is “still bleeding.”\n  4. In a car-lit nighttime livestream, the speaker repeats she still has “diamonds on” while cursing at “Peach.”\n  5. A later montage shows a woman sitting in a car with the on-screen text “@supapeach @mulatto,” as a car horn sounds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n  1. The first event is a warning from a sassy female voice that someone is living in a fairytale and will see them \"tonight in real life.\"\n  2. Next, there is a scene where a woman is yelling at someone who has apparently stolen something and claiming that they did not get out of jail thinking they were tough.\n  3. Then, we have a scene where security is restraining someone in a crowded outdoor area, and a male voice is warning about tasers and urging everyone to leave.\n  4. After that, we see a live stream with colorful lights where a female voice is asserting her confidence and talent, and threatening to drag someone.\n  5. Finally, we see a red-haired person appear on the live stream, and another aggressive female voice chanting \"JD! JD!\" and continuing the same speech as before.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option C: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.",

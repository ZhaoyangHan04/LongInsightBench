    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\nLaura feels pressure at The Roxy and has doubts before her Troubadour show - this event happens first, followed by Maxwell's introduction of icebreakers and opening of the card box where Laura picks an orange one. Then comes the discussion about representation and learning to embrace one's greatness, which leads up to the moment when Laura describes the Troubadour night as \"magic\" and Maxwell praises her. Finally, there is the toast with cookies and the shattering glass sound.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is option C: 7 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3.",

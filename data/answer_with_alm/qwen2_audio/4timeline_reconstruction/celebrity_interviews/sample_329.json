    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 6\nOption A is incorrect because the host mentions \"a Lion King clip appears\" after discussing his appearance in the clip, which comes before the whoosh and the title card.\nOption B is incorrect because the Quran verse overlay appears before the host thanks the viewers for watching and calls them to pray all their salah on time, which comes after the host introduces Sana Khan.\nOption C is incorrect because the woman in a cream hijab appears after the host thanks the viewers for watching and calls them to pray all their salah on time, which comes after the Quran verse overlay.\nOption D is the correct answer because it follows the sequence of events in the video. First, there is a Lion King clip. Then, a whoosh leads into a fiery title card that reads \"BEING REAL IN A FAKE WORLD.\" After that, a Quran verse overlay appears while the host discusses turning to Allah. Next, upbeat Bollywood music plays as the host lists the statistics of an actress named Sana Khan. Finally, the host introduces Sana Khan and mentions that she has left her career for her Creator.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n- On a split-screen call, a woman says, “there is no matter in this world bigger than your life.”\n- An alarm clock reading 6:00 is turned off while the host speaks about affirmations and saying “alhamdulillah.”\n- A cash-register sound plays as red-carpet visuals of a woman in a white dress appear during talk of “glamor and glitz.”\n- After “heartbreak” is mentioned, a short laugh is heard as a tear rolls down someone’s cheek.\n- Split-screen text reads “EVEN AFTER PILLS I CAN’T SLEEP,” and a chime is heard at the end.\n- The host states Sana’s breakup involved infidelity and physical abuse.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5.",

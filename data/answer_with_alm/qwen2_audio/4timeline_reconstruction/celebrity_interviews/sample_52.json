    "model_answer": "The events seem to be related to the life and activities of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry within the royal family. Based on the mention of their decision to step back from royal duties and move to Los Angeles, it seems that option A (6 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3) could be the most likely chronological order, as this sequence starts with their decision to leave the royal fold and moves backward through time to their engagement and early days as a couple.

    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is option D: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.\nAt night, a news anchor appears as a narrator calls the split “Hollywood’s biggest cliffhanger.” (1)\nAn exterior “Church of Scientology” Los Angeles sign is shown while speakers link the split to his religion. (2)\nA woman says the “most extraordinary thing” was meeting Tom and how happy she is, amid media flashes. (3)\nA man in a light blue shirt at a laptop is introduced as journalist Mark Ebner. (4)\nOver a document labeled “a blatant lie,” a voice states the church denies any wife-seeking project. (5)\nCommentary notes Katie often appeared with a church spokesperson during their relationship. (6)\nA web browser displays “freekatie.net” as a voice mentions “FreeKatie.com.” (7)\n\nTherefore, the sequence is the news anchor introducing the situation, showing a sign related to Tom Cruise's religion, hearing a woman's perspective, seeing a reporter, reading about a church denying a project, learning about Katie's involvement with the church, and finally seeing a website related to the situation.",

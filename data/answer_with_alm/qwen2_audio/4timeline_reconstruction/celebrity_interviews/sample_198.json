    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: (1) A cash register sound plays right after a female anchor says “please stay with us” during the opening “THE INTERVIEW” graphics. (2) A percussive sound occurs as the interviewer clarifies a point about Bush and WMDs on the dark set. (3) Jon covers his head briefly while saying he struggles to see condoning waterboarding as not evil. (4) The interviewer cites Bush’s book, “Damn right, waterboard the guy,” prompting Jon’s “Oh my god, what happens to me now?” (5) They describe torture becoming an “asset,” and Jon replies about “legal maneuvering” in a close-up. (6) A female announcer over a wide studio desk shot asks viewers to stay for more of the interview.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

This is then followed by Jon debating various topics, such as masculinity, the safety of the world without Saddam, and the use of waterboarding. Finally, Jon holds a blue mug while discussing rationales for the war and references Powell and anthrax.",

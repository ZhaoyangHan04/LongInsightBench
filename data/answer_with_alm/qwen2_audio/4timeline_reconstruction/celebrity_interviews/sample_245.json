    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n  1. Over a courtroom scene, the narrator quotes the petition about \"irreconcilable differences\" and that nothing can salvage the marriage.\n  2. A newspaper close-up shows \"TAMAR BRAXTON SISTER TOWANDA OWES Her $35K\" while the speaker explains Towandaâ€™s debt and monthly income/expenses.\n  3. The speaker says Tamar isn't asking for spousal or child support while a \"SUMMONS (Family Law)\" form lies on a desk.\n  4. During the opening, a male voice sings \"Here we go again\" as \"EXCLUSIVE\" and \"LIVE\" appear over two women.\n  5. The host offers condolences as a memorial screen reads \"TONI BRAXTON NIECE DIES AT 24\" over a sky-and-steps background.\n  6. The narrator excitedly says \"status only divorce\" as a split image of Tamar and Vince separated by torn paper is shown.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option A: 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 1 -> 3.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: C: 4 -> 2 -> 6 -> 3 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5\nThe sequence starts with the appearance of a digital tunnel for \"The Truth Show,\" which indicates that event 4 is the starting point. This is followed by speculation about Toni's financial troubles (event 2), which likely occurred before the other events mentioned. Then there is a mention of a contract and organ selling (event 3), which could be related to the ongoing discussion about Toni's financial situation. After this, there is a comment about a man in a light blue dress and floating dollar bills (event 6), which may be a separate but related topic. Finally, there is a promotional slate inviting viewers to sign up on the website (event 5), followed by commentary on Vince's depression (event 7) and a memorial screen for Toni's niece (event 8).",

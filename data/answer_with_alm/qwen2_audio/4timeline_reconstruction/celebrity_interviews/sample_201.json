    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is: \n\n1. A brief Flash-themed sound effect plays immediately after the on-screen court-headline appears.\n2. The speaker states this involves a 12-year-old and a separate parent while the Massachusetts protection-order text overlay is on screen.\n3. The NBC News overlay appears as the speaker reads that the court saw a “substantial likelihood of immediate danger of harassment” and that the order lacks specific allegations.\n4. A loud crashing effect punctuates the cut to the Deadline article about Zaslav’s “first movie crisis” over The Flash.\n5. A red-carpet clip of a person in a white embellished outfit plays while the speaker contrasts “odd” red-carpet antics with “grooming children and beating people.”\n6. After the speaker says Warner Bros. should boot the new Flash, a comical “boing” sound effect is heard.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the moments is:\n\n  1. A speaker calls Trump “the incumbent outsider” and says there’s no reason Biden should follow a “Bernie manifesto” or AOC’s Green New Deal.\n  2. The discussion rejects the phrase “women’s issues,” and the other guest briefly claps while adding Biden is still doing better with women.\n  3. A speaker argues things “turned around” a few weeks ago when Trump tweeted about wearing masks.\n  4. The same woman recalls predicting 200,000 likes on a tweet and notes the President canceled his live convention, as shots switch between a dim room and a flag backdrop.\n  5. Black-and-white protest footage appears while a speaker talks about George Floyd, Jacob Blake, unrest, and people walking around with firearms.\n  6. The segment declares “hidden undercover Trump voter,” then ends with tense promo music and a metallic clang as Showtime branding appears.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option C.",

She then mentions Trump putting her in charge and hiding in plain sight, which leads into the next shot.\nThe second shot is a black-and-white shot of two women talking, which introduces the topic of working for Obama and feeling like an outsider. This is followed by the third shot, where one woman discusses the gender gap and accuses someone of scaring women with ads.\nThe fourth shot is of the woman in the two-women interview room with the flag and fireplace, where she praises a progress report and contrasts the two presidents' terms. This leads into the fifth shot, where a voice challenges the notion of peaceful protesters and plays melancholic music.\nThe sixth shot is of two women discussing Trump's support, with one saying it's mostly white working-class and the other asking why he's denounced. This leads into the seventh shot, where the woman speaks about feeling angry when people mock her for attending church or owning a firearm.\nFinally, the eighth shot is of the woman in the dimly lit",

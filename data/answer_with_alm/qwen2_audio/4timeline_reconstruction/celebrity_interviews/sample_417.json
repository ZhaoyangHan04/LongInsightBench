    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \n1. A graphic with silhouettes and the text \"HOTTEST RAP & SINGER\" appears while a speaker hypes a secret tape; trap music hits and a voice says, \"Yeah, we on Boss Talk one-on-one.\"\n2. The suited host leans in and says he has a story and will ask if the listener knows it.\n3. The man in a black t-shirt recounts a guest returning upset, saying a woman stole money and tried to pay a choosing fee; another speaker links it to a song.\n4. The suited speaker emphasizes Pimp C as a family man and mentions visiting him in jail and writing letters.\n5. Cut to a man wearing a cap marked \"NÂ°1\" as a voice says there were \"$250,000 worth of features\" after coming home and references \"Free Pimp C\" and \"Bum B.\"\n6. The conversation returns to the tape story; one speaker says he tried to get the tape and it could be worth millions, while another reacts with shocked laughter.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is D: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5.\nThe first event mentioned is a man and woman sitting against a brick wall, which leads into a discussion about taking care of family and the importance of Pimp C's words. This is followed by a transition to a segment about a popular rapper and singer, which leads to a discussion about the speaker's collaborations and experiences in the music industry. Then, the host asks the speaker about attending the Player Anthem video, which leads to a discussion about Pimp C's request for pimps to be included in the video. Finally, there is an electronic instrumental played under a logo screen, and a voice says something, but it does not seem to be directly related to the previous events.",

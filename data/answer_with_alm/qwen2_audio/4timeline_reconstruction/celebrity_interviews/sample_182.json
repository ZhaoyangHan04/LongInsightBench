This event probably happens at the beginning of the show.\n  * Event 2: The host asks if she rides horses; she jokes not in Manhattan and says she rides in New Jersey. This event happens after event 1 and before event 3.\n  * Event 3: The guest says it’s her first show; the host notes they don’t have “Jeff/Geoff” or a horse on that show, only proper things. This event happens after event 2 and before event 4.\n  * Event 4: She says the ones she works with do get along and calls them “amazing,” and he adds there are actors too. This event happens after event 3 and before event 5.\n  * Event 5: They talk about “Jason Banks” being very hairy; the host jokes hugging him sounds like a newspaper and then says, “We’re out of time.” This event happens after event 4 and before event",

    "model_answer": "The answer is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7. The events seem to be chronological based on the description of each moment provided in the audio. Simone met her partner on the dating app Raya in March 2020, which likely led to their first visit during the pandemic. They continued seeing each other and became magnets, as described in option (2). In June 2021, the narrator watched Simone compete, and later wrote about it in a post. This was followed by the outdoor proposal in 2022, which was documented on social media. The narrator then attended Simone's courthouse wedding in April 2023, after which she changed her legal name. Finally, Simone and her partner had a destination wedding in Cabo in May 2023, which was also highly publicized. The Vanity Fair cover from July 2023 features Simone and her new husband, further emphasizing their happy moment.",

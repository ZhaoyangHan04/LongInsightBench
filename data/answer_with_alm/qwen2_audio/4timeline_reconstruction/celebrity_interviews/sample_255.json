    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\nFirstly, we have a cartoon moose intro which happens at the beginning of the video. Then, there is a warm greeting mentioning being in Holland over mellow blues music. This leads us to option 2 where someone talks about their past gigs and current graduation moment. After that, the conversation shifts to songwriting and the importance of knowing when a piece of music is finished. We see footage of the person performing on stage in a yellow shirt, which corresponds to option 3.\nNext, the person talks about their favorite guitarist, Jeff Healy, and how he would become very intense before shows. This is followed by option 4 where the person describes their aggressive distorted riff. Finally, an interviewer asks if they will play a specific song on stage, and the person responds that they will play what they feel. This leads us to option 5 where the interview takes place.\nLastly, the person shows off their main guitar, a worn white Stratocaster, which was bought about ten years ago. This corresponds to option 6. Therefore, the correct order of events is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> ",

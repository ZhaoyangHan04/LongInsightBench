    "model_answer": "The correct sequence of events is:\n\n- Event 4: Realizing the pad is wrong (Tricolology UL80 summer pad)\n- Event 3: Frustration over the realization and the need for a new solution\n- Event 1: Cutting small pine branches to build a 2-3 inch layer beneath Tyvek\n- Event 2: Moving on from the equipment failure to a safer location (the garage)\n- Event 5: Describing the successful warm but claustrophobic quilt-inside-bag setup\n- Event 6: Final solution with foam and Reflectix inside the bag\n\nTherefore, the correct order is: 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2. Option A is the closest but includes an extra event (dogs barking), so it's not the correct choice. Options B, C, and D all include the same events in a different order, so they are also incorrect.",

This likely follows the music as it provides context for the activity being performed.\n  * After that, the man uses the front winch to lift the trailer floor. This action comes next in the sequence as it requires the previous steps to be completed.\n  * A male voice then explains different pole types and notes each pole has a number. This information may be relevant for setting up the tent, so it could come after lifting the trailer floor.\n  * A distinct door thump is heard, followed by the speaker saying, \"Now it's time to set up the tent.\" This indicates that the process of setting up the tent has begun.\n  * A title card appears reading \"STAGE THREE Basic Tent Setup,\" which further confirms that this is the stage where the tent is being set up.\n  * Finally, the speaker says to locate your door key and open the trailer door. This step likely follows",

    "model_answer": "Answer: C: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7\nThe sequence starts with converting the camper's rear bed into a lounge (option 1), which is followed by a discussion about setting up the annex (option 2). This leads to the screen showing the title \"STAGE FOUR THE ANNEXE\" (option 3), indicating that the annex setup is the next step. The instructions for setting up the annex mention that it takes about 20-30 minutes and offers a \"little trick\" (option 4).\nNext, we hear about inserting the hooked ends of ridge poles and noting it as a two-person job that's easier if you're tall (option 5). This is likely followed by the use of zippers, Velcro, and pegs to secure the annex walls, with audible zipping and hammering (option 6). Finally, a male voice declares the Stirling LX is all set up and ready, and a loud whoosh is heard (option 7), completing the setup process.",

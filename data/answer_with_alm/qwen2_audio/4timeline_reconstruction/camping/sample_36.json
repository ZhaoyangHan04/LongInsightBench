    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is: \n1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\nThe audio starts with a woman recounting her experience, followed by a visual of a coiled rattlesnake. This sets the scene for the dangerous wildlife that can be found in the area. She then mentions an incident where a coyote came out under cover of darkness, which is labeled as number four. This is followed by a warning about loose sand at the beach and the need for appropriate footwear, which is represented by beach signs. The speaker then shows recovery gear and radios, saying \"at number three.\" Finally, he exclaims \"That is not right\" upon seeing a syringe on the beach, which brings us to the end of the sequence.",

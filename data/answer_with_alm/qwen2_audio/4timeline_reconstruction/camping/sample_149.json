    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nExplanation: In the audio, the man starts by welcoming viewers and introducing the show's logo, which appears with sparkles and soft acoustic music. Then, the woman explains how a truck tent keeps you off the cold ground and warmer, while showing a tent bed with a floral blanket. After that, the woman recounts her personal experience of waking up in the middle of an air mattress, and the man agrees, showing an indoor mattress shot. Next, the woman praises sitting up in the truck tent with pillows to read and enjoy the view, accompanied by a scenic canyon cutaway. Finally, while a windshield overlay reads “Freedom to camp where you want,” the man talks about going anywhere with 4WD and contrasts spacious “house tents.” Therefore, the events happen in the order 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

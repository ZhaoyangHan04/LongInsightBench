First, Darren prepares coffee using the Kelly Kettle (option 2). Then, Camper stirs a pot over the campfire while the rice boils and curry bubbles (option 1). After that, the speaker praises a Pathfinder cup and mentions bringing soup (option 3). Next, Camper talks about bringing porridge, oats, or noodles on the next trip (option 4). Finally, in heavy rain with a storm coming, they wrap up for the night and say theyâ€™ll see each other in the morning (option 5). Lastly, in daylight, they tidy the site and decide to go on a hike (option 6).\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4.\n\nFirstly, the yellow wheel chock is placed under a tire as the speaker stresses securing the trailer (1). Then, the speaker mentions that the annex is a two-person job, and we see two men securing the awning (2). This event likely occurred after the tire was secured with the wheel chock. Next, a congratulatory message about purchasing an Easy Trail K-Series camper plays, and a man stands before EZYTRAIL trailers (3), indicating that the purchasing process has been completed. After this, camping tips are mentioned, which include tying guy ropes (4). We then hear the Offroad Media logo with a whooshing sound, along with credits (5), suggesting that this segment of the video is concluding. Finally, the speaker says it's time to set up the tent on the Stirling GT as the man climbs into the trailer (6), and the narrator advises getting a mate to drive the vehicle forward as the man waves from the vehicle (7).\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events is: 1 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4.",

Event 1 seems to be the introduction or setup of the scene where he's explaining various tent components. Event 5 involves him listing different types of tent poles, which likely follows after explaining the corner stay pole. Event 2 involves raising the bed bow inside the tent, which may come after explaining the other tent poles or even after setting up the annex walls. Event 4 involves setting up annex walls, which likely comes after explaining the bed bow and before tying a knot in a rope. Finally, event 6 involves production credits and the Offroad Media logo, which likely comes at the end of the video.",

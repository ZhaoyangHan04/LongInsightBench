    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option D: 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2.\nFirstly, after the man recommends using a rugged big black tote with a yellow top as a dedicated bin, the woman begins talking about packing for camping. She then mentions that they will show how to make sure everything needed is packed. This implies that the discussion about packing starts immediately after the initial recommendation.\nNext, a \"Camping Checklist\" graphic appears on screen while the woman continues her packing instructions. This indicates that the checklist is shown before the specific items are mentioned.\nAfter the checklist, the woman suggests labeling a bin \"camping stuff.\" This happens after the discussion about packing has already started but before the specific items are listed.\nFinally, a close-up shot of a plastic container with towels is shown, along with on-screen text that mentions \"Extra Lanterns & Flashlights.\" This occurs after the discussion about towels and other essential items has begun.\nLastly, the woman reflects that she sometimes realizes she left something at home while packing. This is said over gentle background music, which implies it comes last in the sequence of events.\nTherefore, the correct order is 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is:\n\n1. Robin introduces himself, mentions a solo wild camp and shifting wind as the hike begins.\n2. He decides on a flat pitch with “cracking views over Edinburgh.”\n3. He sets up the tent as unexpected rain starts and notes there’s little daylight left.\n4. Outside at night, he points out the moon, says it’s just before 9 p.m., and heads back because it’s cold.\n5. Later in the tent, he discusses wind gusts on his phone; another clip notes, “that is 22 and I have just been woken up.”\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

This suggests that event 1 comes first.\n\nNext, we hear about a man starting a fire, which indicates that event 2 has taken place.\n\nAfterwards, there is a mention of finding a campsite, suggesting that event 3 has occurred.\n\nEvent 4 occurs when a male mentions the ice being 'Zamboni flat,' which implies that they have reached a flat area of the lake suitable for setting up camp.\n\nFinally, event 5 takes place when one person describes making a spruce bath mat, and event 6 ends with the group finishing their camp chores and heading out for a skate.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

Then, he arrives at a forest clearing and says, \"Here is going to be our spot for the night... nice view of the lake.\" Next, we hear about him setting up a tarp shelter using a ridgeline with three pegs. After that, over a view of a frozen lake, on-screen text reads \"Temperatures dropped to -5C overnight.\" Kevin then holds a yellow cup by the tent and says, \"First coffee of the day... cheers.\" Finally, standing on the dock, he says he's back on the ferry to head home after a change of plans.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \n1. At night, a Jeep crawls a snowy trail while the narrator complains about being stuck again and says “Tom is doing it like a champ.”\n2. Several people shovel around a stuck vehicle on the snowy road; an engine revs as they work.\n3. A voice says “while they’re digging that out” and splits firewood as upbeat banjo music kicks in.\n4. The orange-beanie man gives “Dick tip” advice to stay on the beaten snowmobile track and to always bring a shovel and towel, then a Jeep departs.\n5. By firelight, a man says “I finally got a fire going” and plans to wait for the others before dark.\n6. Friends arrive cheering, announce “steaks of Diego” and “meats of Nelson,” and toast “Cheers!” to start cooking.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

Next, there are close-ups of a Garmin watch and phone on a paper map as they discuss a waypoint, followed by driving through the snowy forest and planning their route.

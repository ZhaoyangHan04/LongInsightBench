    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \n1. A gunshot sound effect plays as a digital interface with the text “POSSIBLES Pouch LOAD OUT” appears. This indicates that the gunshot sound comes before the text appears on the screen.\n2. The host says “welcome back everyone” which means this event happens after the introduction.\n3. The host defines a “possibles pouch” and mentions it’s attached to his big MOLLE-compatible backpack as the labeled bag is shown. This means the definition of the possibles pouch happens after the host shows the pouch.\n4. Zippers and ripping sounds are heard as blue-sleeved hands open the POSSIBLES pouch. This means the opening of the pouch happens after the host has defined it.\n5. Close-up of a Fenix PD26R flashlight while the host lists a handheld torch and pocket bellows. This means the listing of items happens after the host opens the pouch.\n6. The orange/black water filter is shown as the host says it’s an unbranded AliExpress version similar to a Sawyer Mini, followed by a zipper sound. This means the water filter is shown after the other items have been listed.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 ->",

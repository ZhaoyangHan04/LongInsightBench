Then, the speaker mentions how the bushcrafty tarp tent works best with a square tarp in the woods. After that, we see a black tarp being laid out and adjusted, followed by the process of folding it into a triangle and setting up the walls using a pole and stakes. Finally, the speaker shows us the sides and front door of the completed tent.",

Then, from inside the tent, he closes the door and hooks it down, noting space above his head and behind him (option B). After that, the camera shows his feet inside as he says heâ€™s laid out completely flat with room for gear (option C).

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6\nThe narrative starts with the narrator mentioning that they will be heading into the Huron National Forest, which sets the scene for the subsequent events. Next, there is a mention of the dog exploring with a harness camera, which indicates that this event occurred before the main narrative. Then, the speaker notes that she made a 'pointy friend,' which likely refers to the dog's excitement or interaction with something in the forest. Afterward, the speaker describes following Cara into the tree line and up the ridge, which provides context for the rest of the events described. The narration then shifts to describing a large porcupine, which appears to be an unexpected encounter. Finally, the speaker comments on a black bear climbing a tree, followed by their decision not to eat it and packing for a long hike back. Therefore, the correct order of events is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6.",

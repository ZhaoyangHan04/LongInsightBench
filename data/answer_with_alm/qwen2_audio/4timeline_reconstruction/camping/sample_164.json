    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n1. The windy outdoor ambience is present before the aerial view of the barren landscape.\n2. The speaker mentions leaving a review and then a low-frequency rumble occurs as the map zooms into dense forest and a road.\n3. The speaker comments on finding a faint road in New Mexico and then zooms into satellite imagery showing a stream/ravine.\n4. He vows to follow \"the Lord\" to take a road to its end and mentions Forest Road 106 meeting a very faint road.\n5. Finally, the speaker refers back to the Google Maps screen and notes a five-star review by Scott Miller.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6.\n\nAnswer: D",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n1. The speaker mentions going camping and that the dog is excited about it, which sets the scene for the rest of the events.\n2. The speaker then talks about setting up a base camp and inspecting the forest property, indicating that this event comes before the other events related to the dog.\n3. Next, we see the electrical setup being discussed, which happens after the decision to set up a base camp has been made.\n4. After the electrical setup, the white dog with brown patches is shown exploring a barren field, which comes after the decision to set up a base camp has been made.\n5. Finally, the white dog barking in a rural yard is shown, which comes last in the sequence of events.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is option B: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4.",

    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1\nOption A best fits the sequence of events. \n\nFirst, the family cheers and thanks Charlene as the boy holds his certificate and gifts are named (option A, step 2). This indicates that the ceremony has already taken place, and the family is expressing their appreciation.\n\nNext, at the campsite, a man mentions that they will go to the ceremony soon while sausages cook (option A, step 3). This implies that the ceremony is taking place nearby and that it is scheduled for later in the day.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the ranger proclaims the child a Colorado State Parks Junior Ranger (option A, step 4). This indicates that the ceremony has concluded, and the child has been officially recognized as a Junior Ranger.\n\nFinally, the child in a red Colorado shirt recites the Junior Ranger pledge after an adult (option A, step 1). This reinforces the idea that the ceremony has ended and that the child has completed the necessary steps to become a Junior Ranger.\n\nTherefore, the correct timeline is 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1, which corresponds to option A.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \n3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 2\nThe audio indicates that the first event is the speaker saying 'on goes our water' as his foot appears in the shot, which implies that he has already started adding water to the fire. This is followed by him exclaiming 'we got steam', indicating that the water has boiled over. Then, the speaker mentions bringing water to a rolling boil for at least a minute, which suggests that this process has already taken place. Finally, the speaker notes that the Pathfinder nesting cup's lid holes show steam when the water boils, which implies that the water has reached a high temperature and is likely boiling rapidly. Therefore, the events in option B best fit the sequence of events described in the audio.",

    "model_answer": "Option B seems like the most logical sequence of events based on the given audio and visual cues:\n\n- Option 2: He shows lanterns by the tent and mentions taking the rainfly off suggests that it is dark outside and they are setting up camp.\n- Option 1: He warns about burning fingers while pushing fuel down into the stove indicates that they are starting a fire.\n- Option 4: He says the dogs have settled in and worries the fire got low on fuel implies that the fire has been going for some time and needs attention.\n- Option 3: He says the wood burns to fine ash and adds more wood after admitting he should have kept the fire fed suggests that the fire was already established and they need to keep it going.\n- Option 5: He packs dry clothes and socks into a dry bag and a tent stake bag to carry water implies that they are preparing to leave camp.\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order would be 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5.",

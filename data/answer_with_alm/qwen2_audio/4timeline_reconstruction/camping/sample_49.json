Then he mentions that this area is a rattlesnake den in summer and the snakes are underground now (2). After that, he describes climbing to the top of some rocks and calling it a nice little spot (3). Next, he explains how he walked along a ridgeline to reach the power lines on this windy day (4). A metal power line tower is then shown on a rocky hilltop (5). Subsequently, he reveals that he has reached his camping spot for the day and is setting up his hammock (8). Lastly, a person with a blue backpack is seen walking through the forest (7).\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\nFirst, he mentions his solo cook set, fire ant stove, and fire kit, implying that these were prepared before starting the cooking process. Next, he describes flames and smoke rising from the stove, indicating that the stove has been ignited. Then, a gray pot with orange handles is placed on top of the stove, which suggests that the pot was likely prepared beforehand and is now being used to heat water for coffee. After that, he talks about patience in primitive fire making and praises the cook set handle, which implies that the handle was checked or adjusted earlier in the process. Finally, the person pours water from a black pot into a gray pot and straps the lid, completing the boiling of water for coffee. The strong wind noise heard later in the audio does not seem to be related to the cooking process.",

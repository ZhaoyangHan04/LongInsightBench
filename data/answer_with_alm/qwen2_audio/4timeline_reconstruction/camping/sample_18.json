    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is: \n1. The video starts with mechanical whirring as he showcases an Anderson plug extension and describes red/white lighting options inside the setup.\n2. A beach backdrop and vehicle sound can be heard while he explains the LK version's ability to attach solar panels and tires.\n3. He mentions that one version can fit two or three people and adds foam underneath for comfort, over a steady motor noise.\n4. In a desert scene, a compressed air sound is heard as he operates and then closes the rooftop tent.\n5. Wind noise accompanies him mentioning a podcast about different rooftop tent versions and “square ones.”\n6. He notes a close decision between versions and price similarity in South Africa, with a constant background hum.\n7. Finally, he thanks viewers, asks them to subscribe, and mentions that he needs tea, with a Patreon prompt visible.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.",

    "model_answer": "The correct order is B: 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 6.\nThe first hint comes from option A, where the sequence starts with someone mentioning 'glen line' which suggests they are at the start of their hike. The next sentence indicates that they are currently at 'man pits', suggesting that they have descended some distance from the Glen Line. This aligns with option B, where the sequence starts with '2' (breathless on a windy ridge), followed by '4' (four five foot greasy wet ditch), then '5' (a safer way down), and finally '1' (he jokes about ticks and Corbett and Graham bagging).\nOption C has an incorrect sequence, as it places '4' (four five foot greasy wet ditch) before '2' (breathless on a windy ridge). Option D also has an incorrect sequence, as it places '2' (breathless on a windy ridge) after '4' (four five foot greasy wet ditch), which does not make sense in terms of the flow of the conversation.\nTherefore, the correct order is B: 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 6",

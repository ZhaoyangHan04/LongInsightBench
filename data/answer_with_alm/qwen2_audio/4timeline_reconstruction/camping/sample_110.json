Then, he jokes about making an omelette with a prawn, indicating that he has already collected something from the water. After that, he makes a comment about the quality of the ground being better than the previous week, suggesting that he has been digging. This leads us to the next event where he mentions twelve buckets and his intention to vacuum or clean a carpet, implying that he has finished digging for the day. Finally, he wraps up the video by showing the last 12 buckets of the season filled with mushrooms, indicating that this was the end of his season of digging.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events is: He goes to the stream, collects something, digs, finishes digging, and shows the results of his work.",

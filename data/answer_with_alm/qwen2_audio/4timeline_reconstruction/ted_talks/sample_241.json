    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n1. A whiteboard lists Cialdini's “6 Shortcuts,” and the narrator explains reciprocity.\n2. The man in the purple shirt defends free speech and notes that others reciprocate it; the narrator then introduces the principle of “liking.”\n3. A FEE panel discusses finding common ground; a raspy voice says that after “five minutes” with an “arch enemy,” skin color matters less.\n4. On stage, a blue-shirted speaker quotes Dan Harmon saying “the discourse is over,” alongside a Rick and Morty reference.\n5. A black screen shows the words “I disagree.” while the narrator argues that peaceful dialogue has enabled civilization.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "The sequence of events is as follows:\n\nFirstly, we hear about the need for a conversation over protest footage, which suggests that there has been some form of conflict or disagreement. This is followed by the title \"ACCIDENTAL COURTESEY,\" which could indicate that the subsequent events are related to this title and might involve an introduction or explanation.\n\nNext, we hear Daryl's voice asking how someone can hate him if they don't even know him, which implies that Daryl is being spoken about or introduced. This is likely followed by visual elements such as a burning cross, which is often associated with white supremacist groups.\n\nFinally, we see a man in a purple shirt folding a white robe, which could be another visual element related to the discussion. However, without more context it is difficult to determine its exact significance.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events seems to be option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

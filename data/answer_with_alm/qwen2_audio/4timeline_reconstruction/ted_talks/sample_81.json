A bungee-jumping image with Newton-force numbers appears as the speaker explains multiplying safety factors.\n3. A text box titled \"Some Consequences of Having Too Little\" appears while the speaker describes poverty experiments and overborrowing.\n4. The Black Swan book cover appears with a spiking graph while the speaker warns about unprecedented floods overwhelming levees.\n5.

    "model_answer": "Option B seems like the most likely option based on the sequence of events described in the audio. Here's why:\n\n- The audio starts with applause fading away as the speaker begins reading Maya Angelou's quote. This implies that option A (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7) is unlikely because there is no indication that the audience was applauding before the speaker started reading the quote.\n- Option C (4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7) also seems unlikely because it doesn't make sense for the speaker to introduce Joe after she has already mentioned that he is an artist.\n- Option D (1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 6) is similar to option C and doesn't seem like the best fit either.\n- Option B (1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5 -> 7) seems like the most logical sequence because it follows the flow of the speaker's speech. After the applause fades away, the speaker introduces Maya Angelou's quote. Then, she moves on to talking about her experience with a crabby boss and lying awake at night. Next",

Then she explains the left-brain critic and tells Joe to use his imagination (2). As she continues, there are sounds of markers accompanying her imagination of Joe one year from today with a new job and collaborators (3). She jokes that he can't afford her, so he must draw it himself and fill it with color and emotion (4). After that, she talks about how drawing releases serotonin and oxytocin (5), and she asks for three bold steps (6). She repeats these steps and mentions her old mullet, saying this is where the magic begins (7). She imitates the rational brain making excuses about a desk and salary, warning you'll stay \"right here\" (8). Finally, she double-dares the audience to choose a symbol, repeats the Maya Angelou quote, and applause ends as the TEDx title card appears.",

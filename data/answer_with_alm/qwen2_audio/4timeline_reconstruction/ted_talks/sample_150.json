A slide on the right reads \"SPOiled\" while the speaker reflects that the internet can make us spoiled.\n  3. A slide appears with an app icon of a cartoon pig and the text: \"When Pigs Fly / Summer project / Never published / My first game.\"\n  4. The game interface for \"When Pigs Fly\" is shown while the speaker explains tapping a pig to eat food and avoid birds.\n  5. The speaker says \"Thank you,\" the audience applauds, and a fast-tempo percussion interlude starts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option C.",

    "model_answer": "Option A seems like the most likely answer, considering the flow of events described in the speech. The speaker starts by discussing the ease of accessing information online, which leads him to talk about finding a framework to try. This is followed by a description of the process of learning the framework, including encountering trouble and spending time on his own. Finally, the speech ends with screenshots of a mobile game, which seems unrelated to the previous events. Therefore, the sequence is likely: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

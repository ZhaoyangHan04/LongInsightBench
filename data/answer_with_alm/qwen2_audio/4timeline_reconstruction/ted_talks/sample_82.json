    "model_answer": "The correct sequence of events is:\n\n1. A female voice introduces Design Matters and asks “why an illustrated Malcolm Gladwell?” as a black screen shows “DESIGN MATTERS LIVE.”\n2. A blonde woman gestures while someone says “people don't put enough into plug-ins.”\n3. A close-up of a sketchbook shows the word “SUDDENLY” as mellow acoustic guitar music begins.\n4. The discussion turns to how Brian and Paul joined; a male voice says he knew Brian would “get Malcolm” while a woman with glasses speaks animatedly.\n5. Excited reactions like “wow” and “nice” are heard as a close-up shows pages with a red geometric design being flipped.\n6. A woman says “three years and hundreds of meetings later, you’re finally ready to get started,” while the Outliers book is shown.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is option C: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6.",

The events seem to happen in the following order: a man in a brown jacket points at a drawing while saying the title pages were nailed down fairly quickly (1), then a yellow Blink book is flipped through, a male voice talks about an explosion and a fuse, followed by abstract strings music (2), after which a man signs a book titled Suddenly while explaining that overly specific illustrations can make readers disengage (3), next a male speaker reflects that storytelling is fueled by fear of losing the audience, ending with “it’s game over,” as a close-up shows pages in a foreign language being flipped (4), then a man in a blue suit asserts it’s the least fashionable time to be designing books (5), another man counters that it’s also the best time because of “a permanent object,” and a woman asks, “In what way?” (6), finally, Debbie Millman identifies the work as the Illustrated Malcolm Gladwell and thanks the audience, followed by applause (7).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.\nVisuals and audio cues suggest that the sequence starts with the blue \"HELLO I AM A…\" and \"STORYTELLER\" graphics, which likely introduce the theme of storytelling and narrative. This is followed by a forest scene with a woman's arms outstretched, representing the connection between storytelling and activism for social justice.\nNext, we see colorful figures in a circle around \"PURPOSE,\" suggesting a focus on finding meaning and direction in life. This aligns with the mention of The God of Small Things making the narrator a literary luminary, indicating the power of storytelling in creating impact.\nA person with a megaphone appears next, possibly representing the role of advocates in promoting change. This is followed by volunteers handing out food, which could symbolize the importance of community and collective action.\nFinally, we have a person resting on a library bench during distant traffic sounds, representing the need for introspection and reflection in the pursuit of personal growth and development. The female voice concludes with \"unfinished symphony,\" suggesting that the journey towards change is ongoing and requires continuous effort and evolution.",

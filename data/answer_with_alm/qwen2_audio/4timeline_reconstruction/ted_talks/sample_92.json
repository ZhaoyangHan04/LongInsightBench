    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is: \n\nFirstly, the video starts with a subtitle saying \"STRONG OPINIONS loosely held,\" which refers to Paul Saffo's mantra. This event happens in the beginning of the video when the speaker is introducing Saffo's idea. \n\nSecondly, there is a debate between two men about a user interface redesign and their ability to meet the deadline. This event takes place after the introduction of Saffo's mantra and before the appearance of the photo labeled \"Sherman Kent.\" \n\nThirdly, a black-and-white photo labeled \"Sherman Kent\" appears on the screen, along with a subtitle that says \"CONFIDENTIAL â€“ The Words of Estimative Probability.\" This event happens after the debate about the user interface and before the speaker begins discussing a 1964 paper by Sherman Kent. \n\nFourthly, a full-screen quote about a serious possibility of an attack on Yugoslavia appears on the screen. This event follows the discussion of Sherman Kent's paper and takes place before the speaker begins talking about the probability lexicon. \n\nFifthly, the speaker recounts how Sherman Kent put the odds around 65% and that others had read \"serious possibility\" as much lower. This event comes next",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events in the audio is:\n\n1. The speaker starts by discussing how the phrase \"strong opinions, weakly held\" is often misused.\n2. Mocking the idea of \"blowhards\" taking over the phrase, the speaker sighs before proposing an amendment to improve the process.\n3. A calendar graphic appears on the screen, showing 75%, as the speaker explains that this framing is clearer and open to criticism.\n4. An example is given, where the odds of something happening are mentioned, highlighting the difficulty in synchronizing different mental models.\n5. As the outro begins, a second male voice interrupts, saying he is the future version of the speaker, followed by a rustling sound indicating the end of the clip.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5.",

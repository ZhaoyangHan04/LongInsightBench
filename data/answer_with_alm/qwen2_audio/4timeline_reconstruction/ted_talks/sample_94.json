    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n1. The speaker starts by addressing the issue of water pollution, which sets the context for the rest of his presentation.\n2. Next, he performs a demonstration by adding waste human hair to a beaker containing water and oil. This likely helps illustrate the severity of the water pollution problem.\n3. After discussing the Kuwait oil spill, the speaker mentions dropping bird feathers into the same oil-water mixture. This could be another way to demonstrate the impact of oil pollution on wildlife.\n4. Following this, the speaker mentions a carpenter using sawdust and proceeds to conduct a sawdust test by pouring sawdust from a bottle. This may be related to the previous discussion about pollution sources.\n5. The speaker then announces the results of the tests, stating that 95% of hair, feathers, and sawdust were removed. This provides evidence of the effectiveness of certain methods for removing pollutants from water.\n6. Finally, the speaker thanks the audience and closes his presentation with inspirational music playing in the background. The appearance of the INK quill end card at this point could indicate the end of the presentation or a transition to another segment.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is option A: 1 ->",

This event is followed by the second speaker signing off with \"Okay, hi, hi.\"\nNext, we see two men sitting on the floor working on a laptop while a story about residents sending pothole reports via WhatsApp to be presented to the government plays. This event comes next.\nAfter this, the light blue shirt speaker describes a chatbot builder that guides class 10th and 12th students to explore options. This is followed by him highlighting building a \"Tech for Dev\" community and products like Avni and Anvita for affordable, open-source solutions.\nFinally, he adds that NGOs can customize open-source tools instead of building costly platforms from scratch. This completes the sequence of events.",

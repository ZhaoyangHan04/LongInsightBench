    "model_answer": "The correct order of events is: (4) An animated atom is shown as the speaker states the uncertainty product must be at least half of Planck’s constant. (5) A blue digital wave landscape appears as the speaker stresses experimental support and universality of wave-particle duality. (3) A vortex-like tunnel is shown as the speaker explains quantum tunneling with a “throwing a ball at a wall” analogy. (1) A massive machine glows blue as the speaker links uncertainty to technologies like electron microscopes. (2) The title “Heisenberg’s Legacy” appears while the speaker reflects on Heisenberg’s lasting impact.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2.",

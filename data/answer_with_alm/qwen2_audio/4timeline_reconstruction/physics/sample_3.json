(1)\nShe turns off the overhead lights before using the laser. (2)\nA red laser beam is aligned along the principal axis toward the mirror. (3)\nShe discusses that a spherical mirror has a constant radius of curvature. (4)\nShe marks and labels the focal point on the board. (5)\nWhile measuring with a ruler, she announces “3.4 centimeters.” (6)\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nShe starts by explaining the process, then demonstrates how rays are reflected in a concave mirror, followed by labeling the incident and reflected rays. Afterward, she discusses the resulting image and prompts viewers for experiments. Therefore, the sequence should be from the beginning of her explanation to the end of the interaction with the audience.",

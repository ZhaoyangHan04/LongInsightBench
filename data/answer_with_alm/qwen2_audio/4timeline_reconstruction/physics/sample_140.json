    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option A: 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2.\nThe timeline starts with the title screen \"Wave Optics\" \"Part 6\" appearing, indicating that this is the first moment in the sequence. The narrator then introduces wave optics and superposition, which comes next.\nAfter that, there is a slide showing the equation \"Y = Y1 + Y2,\" and a male voice saying \"Okay.\" This suggests that the equation was presented before the narrator acknowledged it.\nFinally, the \"Young's Double Slit Experiment\" title appears, and the narrator describes coherent sources S1 and S2 and alternate bright/dark bands. This marks the end of the first part of the presentation.\nTherefore, the order of events is: Title screen -> Introduction to wave optics and superposition -> Equation presentation -> Acknowledgment of equation -> Young's Double Slit Experiment description.",

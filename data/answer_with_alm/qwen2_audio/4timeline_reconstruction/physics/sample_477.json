    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on superconductivity for help. The speech starts with a discussion about superconductivity, which leads into a mention of diamond blasting, then transitions to a discussion about energy production, and finally returns to the topic of superconductivity. Therefore, the answer is (D).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events in the video is:\n\n- Event 2: A graph of Earth's cross-section appears, which indicates the presence of 3.6 Mbars of pressure.\n- Event 3: A diagram of a diamond anvil cell is displayed, showing a sample of sulfur hydride being squeezed between two diamond anvils.\n- Event 4: A microscope labeled \"WILD\" and a tray of crystals are shown, which likely represent the samples used in the experiment.\n- Event 1: A speaker discusses the properties of sulfur hydride and Cooper electrons.\n- Event 5: A copper wire spool is shown, along with a discussion of electrical resistance and current flow.\n- Event 6: Lab visuals with a microscope and graphs appear, referencing a 2015 study that found hydrogen sulfide could become superconducting at negative temperatures under high pressure.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is B: 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 6.",

The second equation is introduced, gaining a -kx2 term, which the speaker identifies as the friction parameter.\n3. A wooden contraption on rollers is released, and the pendulums synchronize in anti-phase. The speaker notes that the platform seems stable.\n4. A white screen appears showing the differential equation θ'' + (g/ell) sinθ = 0, which the speaker refers to as a second-order homogeneous differential equation.\n5. Equations are rewritten as x1' = x2 and x2' = -(g/ell) sin x1, and the speaker mentions that this is a simple harmonic oscillator with no friction.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

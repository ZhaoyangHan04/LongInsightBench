This indicates that event 1 occurred before event 2.\n\nEvent 2 happens when the speaker starts talking about using Green's functions to solve a second-order equation. This implies that the whiteboard was already there before the speaker started explaining.\n\nEvent 3 occurs after event 2, as the speaker references solving equations with non-constant coefficients, which builds upon the topic introduced in event 2.\n\nEvent 4 involves the addition of the line y(x) = ∫ G(x, x') f(x') dx', which suggests that the speaker has moved on from discussing general principles to specific techniques for finding Green's functions.\n\nEvent 5 follows event 4, as the speaker outlines the algorithm for finding G(x, x'), which involves integrating both sides around a small interval and considering continuity with the delta function.\n\nFinally, event 6 takes place after event 5, as the speaker continues to discuss integration, coefficients, and the delta function, indicating that the algorithmic approach introduced in event ",

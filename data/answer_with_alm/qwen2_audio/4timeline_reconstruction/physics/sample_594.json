    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n1. The narrator mentions that light is made up of particles, which happens before he starts talking about the bulb near Newton's portrait.\n2. The narrator then refers to a Dutch physicist named Huygens, which comes after he has finished discussing the bulb.\n3. The text \"Aether Medium\" appears on the screen, which happens after the narrator has talked about the concept of the aether medium.\n4. The narrator asks what the ripples are, which comes after he has explained that they are wavefronts.\n5. The narrator defines wavefronts as a set of particles in sync, which happens after he has shown the animation of wavefronts appearing flat far from the bulb.\n6. Finally, the narrator refers to a faraway sphere looking flat and calls them \"flat/plane wave fronts,\" which comes after he has defined wavefronts.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option A: 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n1. The narrator starts by describing light as disturbances and ripples in the ether (Option A).\n2. Next, the narrator compares light waves to water waves, stating that water waves are two-dimensional circular ripples on a surface (Option B).\n3. After explaining this, the narrator shifts gears and asks about the nature of light waves themselves, mentioning that he will clear the visual display (Option C).\n4. As the visual display changes, the narrator asks the viewer to consider the shape of a wave front far from a light bulb (Option D).\n5. In response to this prompt, the narrator shows that from far away, a sphere appears flat and calls them “flat/plane wave fronts” (Option E).\n6. Finally, the narrator concludes his explanation by stating that there is no ether medium and that light is a complicated wave (Option F).\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is Option C: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5.",

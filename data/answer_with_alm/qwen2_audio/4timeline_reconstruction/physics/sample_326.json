    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is option B: 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 6.\n\nFirstly, we have event 3 where the electronic buzzer is heard, followed by event 2 where a cow sound is heard. Then, there's event 4 where the title appears on a black screen, introducing circular motion and definitions. After that, event 5 takes place, which involves a throat clearing sound as the blue circle diagram with V is used to discuss frequency and period. Next, event 1 happens, where the speaker says \"s equals theta r\" while a blue Δθ diagram with v1, v2, and Δv is shown. Finally, event 6 takes place, which involves a burp being heard following a humorous aside about the omega symbol on a black text screen.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events is as follows: electronic buzzer (3), cow sound (2), title and definitions (4), frequency and period discussion (5), \"s equals theta r\" and Δθ diagram (1), and burp (6).",

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence of events is: 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6\nOption A is incorrect because the sound effect that concludes the numerical example segment (boing) comes last, after all other events have concluded.\nOption B is incorrect because the description of the events does not match the order in which they occur.\nOption C is incorrect because the children on the merry-go-round are shown before the narrator mentions the cylinder's rotation rate.\nOption D is the correct answer because it matches the order in which the events are described in the audio and visual aids provided.",

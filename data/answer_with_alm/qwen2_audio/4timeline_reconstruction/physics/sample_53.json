The constant current (e.g., about 5 mA) is set and an initial voltage/temperature reading is taken.\n3. The energy band gap is obtained from the linear fit of the plotted graph.\n4. The aim/title slide introduces studying Ge resistivity vs temperature to find band gap.\n5. The final slide shows results (resistivity decreases with temperature, Eg value) and then lists precautions.\n6. Resistivity values are computed and entered into the observation table.\n7. The speaker explains that voltage decreases during heating up to around 200Â°C, then to turn off the oven and take cooling readings.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option A: 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2.\nFirst, he connects two wires to a constant current source and two to a digital voltmeter (step 3). Then, he sets the constant current to about 5 mA on the setup (step 1). Next, he explains how to plot log10(resistivity) versus 1000/T (step 2). After that, he turns on the four-probe setup and oven (step 4). As the oven heats up, he takes voltage measurements during cooling down after turning off the oven (step 5). Finally, he uses a table to look up t/s and a correction divisor for the probe spacing and crystal thickness (step 6).\n\nTherefore, the sequence is: Connect wires to constant current source and voltmeter (3), Set constant current to 5 mA (1), Explain plot of log10(resistivity) vs 1000/T (2), Turn on four-probe setup and oven (4), Take voltage measurements during cooling (5), Look up t/s and correction divisor in a table (6).",

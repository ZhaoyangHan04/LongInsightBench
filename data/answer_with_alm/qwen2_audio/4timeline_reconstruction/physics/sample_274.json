This is followed by the water cycle infographic being shown as the speaker explains evaporation to precipitation and mentions groundwater conservation. A thermometer and water container then appear as the speaker says there is equilibrium between evaporation and condensation. Arrows labeled for evaporation and condensation rates appear while he says the temperature is high. Hygrometers and thermometers are then shown as the speaker cites readings like 35%, 52%, and 56% with skepticism. He explains dry- and wet-bulb measurement and states the wet-bulb is 13°C, followed by a boing sound. Finally, a table is pointed at to use a 6°C wet–dry difference to compute relative humidity.",

This is followed by setting a temperature and relative humidity to calculate absolute humidity (AH), and finding the dew point from the graph. This sets up the context for discussing precipitation types.\n\nNext, heavy rain is shown as the speaker begins talking about rain formation. This is followed by examples of different types of precipitation: rain, sleet, and hail. Finally, snow is discussed, including how it forms through the deposition of water vapor into hexagonal crystals and how it appears in various natural settings.\n\nThroughout this lesson, the speaker also references the dew point and its role in determining the conditions for precipitation formation. Therefore, the events are ordered based on the discussion of these topics.",

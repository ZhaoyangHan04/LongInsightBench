    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n  1. The video starts with the title card \"Quantum Mechanics 1: Birth of the Quantum,\" introducing the series.\n  2. Next, a plain white slide displays the title “Physics in the latter years of the nineteenth century” as the narrator says physics seemed largely complete.\n  3. A portrait of Max Planck labeled 1858–1947 appears while the narrator ironically quotes advice that “almost everything is already discovered.”\n  4. Under the same title slide, diagrams progress from mechanics to electromagnetism, ending with a distinct popping sound.\n  5. Finally, a split-screen of an old-fashioned and a modern incandescent bulb appears while the narrator talks about temperature and light intensity vs. wavelength.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option B: 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is option A: 5 -> 6 -> 1 -> 2 -> 7 -> 3 -> 4 -> 8.\n\nThe first event involves a white slide displaying a formula for entropy, which is followed by a histogram showing the distribution of particles in a container. This leads into a discussion of statistical mechanics and the concept of entropy.\n\nNext, there is a shift to a visual representation of accelerated charges emitting radiation, which is connected to the sun's behavior. This is followed by a demonstration of light bulbs and glowing metals, which are used to illustrate the concept of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThe final part of the video involves a series of equations and diagrams explaining the principles of statistical mechanics and electromagnetism. The video ends with a black-and-white photo of Ludwig Boltzmann and a summary of the key concepts covered in the video.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events leading up to the introduction of quantum mechanics in the video is as follows:\n\n- White slide with entropy formula\n- Histogram of particles in a container\n- Discussion of statistical mechanics and entropy\n- Visual representation of accelerated charges emitting radiation\n- Demonstration of light bulbs and glowing metals\n- Equations and diagrams explaining statistical mechanics and electromagnetism\n- Black-and-white",

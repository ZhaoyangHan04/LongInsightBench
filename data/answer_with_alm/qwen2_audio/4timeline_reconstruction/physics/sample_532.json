    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\n\nOption A correctly orders the events based on the description provided in the video. \n\nEvent 2 involves the introduction of the Stage 2 board and explaining the radius for circular motion and relative velocity in the moving frame. Event 3 takes place after this and involves defining losing contact (N=0) where mg cosθ balances qB·u and identifying u as the speed at loss of contact. Event 1 follows next, where the speaker applies the work-energy theorem and notes that only gravity does work, concluding that u² = 2g sinθ. Event 4 then introduces the concept of moving to a frame to create a v × B electric field so that qE cancels mg, converting the cycloidal motion to circular. Event 5 is the derivation phase, which emphasizes eliminating unknowns using boxed relations, substitutions, and squaring steps. Finally, event 6 concludes the discussion by noting that taking the square root matches the answer book and highlighting transforming cycloidal to circular motion as the key technique.",

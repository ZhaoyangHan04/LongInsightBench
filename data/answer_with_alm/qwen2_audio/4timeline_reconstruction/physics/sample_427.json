    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n1. A title with the Blueprint Education logo opens while a voice explains the galvanometer detects very low current. (Option C)\n2. Precautions and sources of error text boxes are shown; a younger voice says thank you. (Option A)\n3. On-screen text says to connect a high resistance in series; the speaker adds “V is the range.” (Option D)\n4. A poster shows R = V/IG - G; the speaker lists apparatus, including sandpaper. (Option B)\n5. Close-up of the galvanometer needle; the voice explains figure of merit and calculating Ig. (Option E)\n6. Real apparatus is shown as the voice instructs drawing the circuit and removing insulation. (Option F)\n7. The instructor concludes the difference is very small and calls the conversion “perfect.” (Option G)\n\nTherefore, the correct order is: 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 2 -> 8 -> 1. Option C correctly orders the events based on the provided information.",

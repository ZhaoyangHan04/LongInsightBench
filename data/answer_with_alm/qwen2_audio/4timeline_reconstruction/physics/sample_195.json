The timeline starts with the upbeat jazz music playing, which sets a positive tone for the series. Next, the lecturer introduces Physical Chemistry II and quantum mechanics, followed by a graph showing actual and theoretical blackbody radiation. This is likely related to the topic of quantum mechanics, which will be explored further in the course. After this, the portraits of Isaac Newton and Galileo appear, which are connected to classical mechanics. Finally, the speaker contrasts light with sound and mentions the famous equation E=mc², which is a key concept in physics and was developed by Albert Einstein. Therefore, the order of events is: Jazz music -> Introduction to Physical Chemistry II and quantum mechanics -> Graph -> Portraits of Isaac Newton and Galileo -> Explanation of E=mc².",

    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is option B: 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2.\n\nThe video starts with rows of solar panels converting sunlight to electricity through the photoelectric effect (event 1). Then, the narrator introduces the topic of quantum mechanics, which involves the study of energy and motion of particles like electrons (event 2).\n\nTo illustrate this concept, the video shows a beach scene with waves (event 3), which can be used to demonstrate how waves and particles exhibit dual behavior - they can behave like waves and also like particles.\n\nNext, the equation E = hf - Φ is displayed, along with labeled parts to explain the different terms (event 4). This equation represents the relationship between energy (E), frequency (f), Planck's constant (h), and the work function (Φ) of a material.\n\nFinally, the video shows two light bulbs side by side, one with a wavy line and the other with green dots, to highlight the difference in their appearance due to the wave-particle duality of light (event 6).\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events is as follows:\n\n- Event 3: Beach scene with waves\n- Event 2: Introduction to quantum mechanics\n- Event ",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: (4) A female voice says \"Kevin, you can't do that!\" with a smack/thud after an abrupt intro on the title slide. (3) A shivering penguin appears while a woman says cooling to \"really, really cold\" can lead to BEC. (1) As a two-particle collision diagram is shown, the narrator states the \"Pauli exclusion principle\" and that no same-state particles can occupy the same point in space. (2) Over an energy-level diagram highlighting the ground state, the speaker says bosons can \"pile into the exact same place.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is option D: 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1.",

This is corrected by a female, stating that they are glad he's there (event 3).\n\nNext, a male explains the Doppler limit and how it limits Doppler cooling (events 4 and 5). After this, images of Nobel laureates are shown (event 6).\n\nFinally, heavy rock music starts playing (event 7), but it is abruptly interrupted by a loud crashing sound (event 8). The video ends with a black screen and a humorous rock song about math monsters playing (event 9).\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9.",

    "model_answer": "The correct order is 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5. The narrative starts with the narrator asking the question 'What is time?' which is overlaid with visual elements such as the man-with-outstretched-arms and the clock. This is followed by the display of the circular \"reference clock\" diagram, which represents the concept of absolute time. As the speaker continues to discuss time and its properties, the low, resonant didgeridoo-like note fades away. In the background, diagrams related to quantum mechanics and cosmology are displayed, including the Einstein Riemannian curvature tensor (Ricci tensor) and the AdS/CFT correspondence. Finally, the 3D star-like network is shown, which represents the concept of non-locality in the universe's evolution. Therefore, the sequence of events is as follows: the narrator asks the question about time, which is accompanied by visual elements; the concept of absolute time is introduced through a diagram; a musical element fades away; additional diagrams related to physics and cosmology are displayed; and the final visual element shows a representation of non-locality.",

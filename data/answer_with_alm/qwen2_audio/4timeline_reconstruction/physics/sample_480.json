    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n- The motivational slide appears as upbeat music starts, which indicates that it comes first.\n- Next, the speaker introduces the concept of specific heat and asks how much energy is involved, which seems to be related to the heat problem they will discuss later.\n- After that, the speaker mentions another problem and introduces a glass heating scenario with an unknown mass.\n- The speaker then shows the result of the glass mass calculation, which is 2.243 kg or 2243 grams.\n- Following that, the speaker moves on to discussing the conversion of grams to moles and the use of Kelvin, which is likely related to the heat problem they are analyzing.\n- Finally, the speaker shows the final temperature of the tungsten slide, which is 45.01°C, and hums, indicating that this slide follows the previous one.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option A: 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 1.",

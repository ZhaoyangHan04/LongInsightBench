Slides explain the principle, with the speaker saying it works on Hooke's Law.\n3. Slides titled “Observations” list diameter readings and show the observation table.\n4. A male voice analyzes the observation table, mentioning the “last column” where values are added.\n5. A slide “Calculations in SI units” shows y = M.g.L / π.r^4 with the result 7.31 × 10^10.\n6. Slides instruct plotting load (x-axis) vs extension (y-axis) and ask “Why should we have two wires?”\nTherefore, the correct order is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is as follows:\n\nFirstly, the male voice makes a comment relating to the table's last column, which indicates that he is discussing data or results from an experiment. This event occurs at the beginning of the audio (option A).\n\nSecondly, a female speaker provides additional context or instruction on how to interpret the data. She mentions selecting specific values (such as 2.5 and 0.5) to calculate the mean extension (1.18 millimeters), and converting this value into meters. This event follows the initial comment from the male voice (option A).\n\nThirdly, there is a discussion about creating a graph of load versus extension. The slides suggest that this graph should be a straight line, and they ask why there should be two wires used. This event takes place next (option B).\n\nFourthly, the frames discuss the use of a spirit level and the importance of waiting a certain amount of time after loading before measuring the displacement. They also explain the concept of bubble displacement and the need to adjust the screw gently. These events occur later in the sequence (option C).\n\nFifthly, there is a mention of the back lash error and the advice to move the screw gently in one direction. This event",

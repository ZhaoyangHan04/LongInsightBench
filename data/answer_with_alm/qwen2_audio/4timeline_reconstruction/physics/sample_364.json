Then, the speaker mentions “Fat Man” and “9 trillion joules,” which are associated with the atomic bomb test, so event 2 happened next.\nAfterwards, the speaker discusses CERN and pair production, which leads us to event 5. This is followed by a short percussive sound and the opening E=mc²/beans visuals, which correspond to event 1.\nFinally, the speaker defines the electron volt and MeV, and shows a beaker graphic noting 4.1813 J to heat 1 liter of water by 1 degree, indicating that event 4 occurred last.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is option C: 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3.\n\nFirstly, the speaker talks about neutrons decaying into other particles, which happens at step 2. This is followed by the mention of particle masses (option C), which occurs next. Then, the speaker moves on to discuss nucleosynthesis and nuclear fission, which takes place in part two, leading us to option C again.\n\nFinally, the speaker addresses deuterium's mass deficit and binding energy, which is related to nuclear fusion and fission. This completes the sequence of events in option C.",

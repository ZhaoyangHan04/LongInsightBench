    "model_answer": "The correct order of events is: (2) A jaunty jazz intro plays over a title card; a green-lit Newton's rings close-up is shown. (5) The speaker mentions two emailed questions while a line drawing of a lens is indicated with a blue pen. (4) A hand places a curved glass lens onto a plate as the setup is explained; an ominous sound ends the segment. (1) Hands press on the lens and adjust the angle to try to see something. (6) An '8x' magnifying glass is used to view a small dark dot on a glass slide, as advised by the speaker. (3) A ring-making paperweight with thumbscrews is opened/adjusted as the speaker identifies it as producing Newton's rings.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is option B: 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 3.",

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence of events is:\n\n1. The video starts with a recap that displays concentric red/green rings through a lens, followed by end credits rolling as jazz music plays.\n2. Next, there's a top-down shot of a blue light being turned on and off while explaining the plan to compare laser light with a white desk lamp.\n3. Then, the speaker describes a half-white light, half-laser comparison where the laser rings align with white-light rings.\n4. After this, the experimenter turns on a lighter while the speaker introduces testing colored lasers on a tripod with paper filtering.\n5. Finally, the video shows concentric rings under white, then green/blue/red illumination as the speaker presents his photos.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is option D: 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1.",

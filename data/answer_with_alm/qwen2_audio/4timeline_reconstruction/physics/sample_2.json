A split-screen shows a skier with the caption “almost fell here!” while cinematic music swells and the speaker explains polarized sunglasses cutting horizontal glare (0:38 - 2:25).\n3. He rotates a camera polarizing filter by 90 degrees, saying it can cut out all the light (2:25 - 3:08).\n4. In a lab, blue microwave cones with a metal grid are used as a polarizer and a rattling sound is heard (3:08 - 3:79).\n5. An oPhysics polarization simulation is shown; the speaker says intensity decreases with the cosine of the angle as a second filter rotates (3:79 - 5:00).\n6. On-screen text states transmission is maximum when filters align and minimum at 90°, followed by a rapid bicycle bell and a playful, ominous music sting (5:00 - 5:68).\n7. He tests a phone/LED with sunglasses, notes",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n1. The speaker starts by discussing his activity in the garden, which involves blowing bubbles and playing a synthwave interlude.\n2. Next, he moves on to a lab setup where he inserts a grid between two blue microwave cones and observes the change in the detector reading along with a rattling sound.\n3. After that, the speaker shifts attention to a personal interaction, kneeling in the yard with a dog nearby. Here, he talks about horizontal versus vertical polarization, punctuated by a short bark from the dog.\n4. In the following segment, the speaker provides a visual demonstration by showing a static diagram of a polarizer producing plane-polarized light. He also mentions how this polarizer cuts out any horizontally polarized light.\n5. Moving on to another aspect of the topic, the speaker introduces two types of filters and references a camera lens and matching orientations for letting light pass through.\n6. The speaker then proceeds to demonstrate the effect of rotating the front polarizer by 90 degrees, followed by a short static sound.\n7. Finally, the speaker takes the audience on a virtual tour by showing a web simulation. Throughout the video, he provides detailed explanations and encourages viewers to explore further.\n\nTherefore, the correct order",

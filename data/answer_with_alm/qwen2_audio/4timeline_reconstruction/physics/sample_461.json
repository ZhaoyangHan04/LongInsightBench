This is followed by the \"Quantum Atomic Model\" slide introducing Bohr orbits and the hydrogen spectral lines. The third event is the \"Gold Foil Experiment,\" which demonstrates the scattering of alpha particles by a small, positively charged nucleus. This leads to the fourth event, where the male voice discusses the history of the atomic model and mentions Aristotle's rejection of the concept. Finally, the fifth event is the \"Boyleâ€™s law\" slide, which aligns with the quantized nature of particles, completing the timeline.",

This is followed by the third slide where electronic configurations and atomic spectra are defined. The fourth slide introduces the quantum atomic model, where electrons can occupy orbits with whole numbers of wavelengths. Finally, the fifth and last slide shows how Bohr orbits relate to hydrogen spectral lines.\nTherefore, the sequence of events is: orbitals (2), historical context (4), electronic configurations & spectra (3), quantum model (5), and application to hydrogen spectra (3).",

He explains isolating the object in the FBD and points around the simplified diagram.\n3. He states \"the sum of all forces must be zero\" and writes Î£F = 0 on the board.\n4. He says the second step is selecting a coordinate system, writes \"1. FBD\" and \"2. C.S.\", and sets x right, y up.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3.",

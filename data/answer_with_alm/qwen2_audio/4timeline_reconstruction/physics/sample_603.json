    "model_answer": "The correct sequence of events is: (1) The speaker introduces \"the addition cure\" while a metallic plate with four spiral cavities is shown. (2) Red putty is pressed into a four-cavity mold; \"Fast Motion\" appears and a hard impact is heard. (3) Teal discs are released from a mold as the speaker explains the peroxide cure. (4) Reddish-brown liquid is poured into a rectangular mold as the speaker explains the condensation cure. Therefore, the answer is A: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4.",

    "model_answer": "The sequence of events in the video is as follows:\n\nFirstly, a blue circular sample is struck with a hammer, which results in a rubbery impact sound. This event is followed by a durometer/dial gauge measuring the sample's hardness, which becomes \"softer and softer\" over time. \n\nNext, two flattened pieces are twisted into rings, and after a slow response, a squeak is heard. This event is likely related to the material properties of the rubber being tested. \n\nSubsequently, two small semicircular pieces are demonstrated, and the speaker comments on their behavior. One of these samples is described as curling and uncurling quickly, which suggests it may have a different texture or composition than the other sample. \n\nIn the final part of the video, two small cylinders made of rubber are shown. One is stiff and requires almost full body weight to deform, while the other is flexible and yields easily to a touch. Both of these samples recover their original shape when pressure is removed. \n\nFinally, a pink foam ball is pressed and slowly deforms under pressure, but bounces back up when released. This indicates that the foam has a high degree of elasticity. \n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of events is option C: 1 ->",

He says “Good morning” and asks “What is simple harmonic motion?” while “Simple Harmonic Motion” is visible on the board.\n  2. He writes x = A sin(ωt) on the whiteboard while discussing vectorial/complex representation.\n  3. Speech briefly gives way to orchestral music and then ambient sounds.\n  4. He says “both are good, both can be used” about sine and cosine forms, pointing at both equations.\n  5. He derives acceleration d²x/dt² and asks “what can we conclude?”\n  6. The video switches to a contact information screen and the lecture speech stops.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option D: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.\nFirst, he explains simple harmonic motion (SHM) conditions and contrasts it with periodic motion. Then, he lists different types of functions, emphasizing that sine/cosine match the definition of SHM (x = A sin(ωt) and x = A cos(ωt)). After that, he states that exponential/log functions and tan, cot, sec, cosec are not suitable for SHM. Next, he writes down the equation for simple harmonic motion (A sin(ωt) + A cos(ωt)) and defines x as displacement and a as amplitude. Finally, he highlights displacement and velocity functions and turns to the acceleration function, asking if conclusions can be drawn.",

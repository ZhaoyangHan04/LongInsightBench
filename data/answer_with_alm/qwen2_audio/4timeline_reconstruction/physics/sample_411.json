    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n1.Narration introduces X-ray diffraction and then one-dimensional diffractometry as synthwave music fades.\n2. The operator presses the green “Open Door” button; the Alarm light turns on and the glass door opens.\n3. The sample holder is locked on the stage and the doors are closed, stopping the blinking alarm.\n4. On the Windows XP desktop, XRD Wizard is used to create and save a scan method, highlighted by yellow arrows.\n5. In XRD Commander, the generator power is ramped up stepwise on the grid interface.\n6. Pressing Start opens the shutter; two red lights illuminate; the goniometer moves and the Busy light turns on.\n7. After the scan completes, the shutter closes automatically and the sample holder is removed using the latch under the stage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 3 -> 6 -> 7.",

The adjustable sample holder is placed on the sample stage fixture and locked in place.\n3. In XRD Wizard, the two-theta range and time per step are set, and the method is saved.\n4. In XRD Commander, the generator voltage/current are ramped in increments with rest periods.\n5. A new scan is set up by entering a sample ID, selecting a parameter file, and choosing a save location.\n6. The Start button opens the shutter; two red lights turn on, the goniometer moves, and the Busy light illuminates.\n7.

Then, the title \"What is the Standard Model?\" appears over a galaxy, along with upbeat jazz music and the host talking about his love for tricky questions.\nNext, the word \"Gravity\" appears with a visual representation of the solar system, and the speaker begins listing the four forces. This is followed by a black end screen showing the production details of the video.\nFinally, a close-up shot of a hand holding a small flame appears as the speaker mentions fire being one of the four elements. The blue screen titled \"Strength of Forces\" then lists the four forces in order of strength, with gravity being the weakest force. The speaker notes that gravity is not part of the Standard Model.\nTherefore, the sequence of events is as follows: the stick figure in a boat throws a heavy sack, the title \"What is the Standard Model?\" appears, the word \"Gravity\" appears, the four forces are listed, a black end screen appears, a close-up shot of a hand",

The speaker then notes that gravity is not part of the Standard Model.\nNext, graphics labeled \"Quarks\" and \"Leptons\" appear, and the speaker names the six quarks and the leptons (electron, muon, tau, neutrinos).\nAfter that, a blue atomic model graphic appears, and the speaker explains atoms, protons, and neutrons.\nIn the fourth event, a black screen with \"Electromagnetism\" and imagery of a compass and a light bulb appears, and the speaker explains its role in electricity, magnetism, light, and chemistry.\nFinally, back at the blackboard with an overlay listing \"Quarks ... Leptons ... Forces Z Y W g,\" the speaker explains forces via exchange particles (gluons, photons, W and Z bosons).",

This happens in the beginning of the video, so option A (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6) seems like the most likely answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

The narration says Earth Twin at age four watches Space Twin at age two in the side-by-side recording.\n3. A bar chart reaches Earth = 10 and Space = 8 as the narrator states the videos last 10 and 8 years and they agree on ages.\n4. The narrator calls it a \"paradox,\" flips the scenario, and proposes focusing on the first four years.\n5. A deep thud sound plays while the narrator discusses symmetric aging over the graphs.\n6. The narrator says symmetry is broken \"by what happens in between,\" with bar charts showing 10 vs 8 and 4 vs 2.\n7. A final slide declares only the accelerating (frame-jumping) twin ages more slowly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7.",

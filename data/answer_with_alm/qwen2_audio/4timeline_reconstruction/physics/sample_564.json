    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nThe first event is the speaker saying, \"Let's get started.\" This sets the scene for the rest of the video.\nThe second event is the sound effect resembling a foghorn, which likely indicates that the subsequent events are related to science or a demonstration.\nThe third event involves a stick figure being drawn next to a circle labeled \"black hole,\" along with gentle music playing in the background. This suggests that the speaker is explaining something about black holes.\nThe fourth event is the speaker defining stellar black holes as \"10 to 24 times the mass of the sun.\" This provides additional context for the previous event.\nFinally, the fifth event involves a jar of peanut butter with a green ball appearing as an analogy for frame-dragging during the Kerr explanation. This ties together all the previous events by providing an example of how frame-dragging works in relation to black holes.\nTherefore, the correct sequence is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, with option B being the closest match.",

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is B: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6.\nThe event described in the audio starts with the static space \"Doge\" image and the jazzy easy-listening music playing in the background. This is followed by the whiteboard writing \"Event Horizon\" for the \"vs. Black Hole\" scenario. As the narrator describes the concept of spaghettification, the background music fades out. Then, a speech bubble appears with \"Singularity\" and a crash/impact sound, after which there is a quiet \"ugh.\" Finally, a gravitational lensing diagram appears on the screen while the soft electronic music plays, and the speaker concludes the presentation with the words \"That's all for today, folks,\" as the credits roll.\nTherefore, the sequence of events is: static space \"Doge\" image and music -> whiteboard writing \"Event Horizon\" -> narrator describing spaghettification -> speech bubble with \"Singularity\" and impact sound -> quiet \"ugh\" -> gravitational lensing diagram -> soft electronic music -> end of presentation.",

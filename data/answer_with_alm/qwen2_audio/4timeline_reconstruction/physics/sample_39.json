Then comes event 4 where he performs a calculation, and finally, event 5 where he announces the start of phase three freefall and talks about summing the times. Event 2, writing something on the board, does not seem to be related to the sequence of events described above.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option D: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 6 -> 4 -> 5.\nFirstly, he starts by saying \"begin our phase two,\" indicating that phase two is about to begin. Then, he mentions paying attention to significant digits and talks about maximum altitude and velocity while gesturing at highlighted parts of the equation. This indicates that he has already written down these values on the board.\nNext, he writes \"900 ÷ 9.81 = 91.7 s\" and explains the remaining unit is seconds. This shows that he has performed a calculation and found the result.\nAfter that, he sets up the freefall equation, stating A = 9.81 and that the final altitude will be zero. This indicates that he has explained the physics behind the freefall motion.\nFinally, he says, “solve this for T,” and a calculator button press is heard. This shows that he is using a calculator to solve for the time it takes for the object to reach its maximum altitude.\nTherefore, the sequence of events is as follows: he starts by mentioning phase two, then talks about significant digits and equations, performs a calculation, explains the physics behind freefall motion, and finally",

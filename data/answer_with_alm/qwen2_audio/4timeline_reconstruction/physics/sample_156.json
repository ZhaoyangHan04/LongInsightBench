    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on physics for help. The video starts with a diagram of a wave marked with Î» as the narrator names \"lambda\" to indicate wavelength, then moves on to a coastal scene labeled \"The wavefront\" while the narrator defines a line where the wave is all at a peak, followed by an opening slide titled \"General wave properties\" as the narrator explains waves transfer energy. A jet with a vapor cone is shown during the wave speed explanation, followed by a flushing sound. Finally, there's a close-up of a blue electric guitar as the narrator defines frequency in hertz and mentions the human hearing range.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is option C: 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 3 -> 6.\n\nThe first event involves a diagram with a wave equation and a description of wave speed, which likely occurred early on in the presentation.\n\nThe second event is a cartoon of a person shouting, which seems unrelated to the preceding events and could be an interlude or a separate topic.\n\nThe third event is about waves hitting a slit and spreading, which is related to wave behavior and could occur next after the wave equation slide.\n\nThe fourth event is a wave amplitude diagram, which also relates to wave behavior and could occur next after the previous event.\n\nThe fifth event is about refraction, which follows logically after the concept of wave behavior has been introduced.\n\nThe sixth and final event is a diffraction diagram tied to a doorway example, which provides an application of the wave concept and could occur last in the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 3 -> 6.",

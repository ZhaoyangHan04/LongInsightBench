TURNING FORCES\" as he states the learning goal.\nHe says the next and last lesson will be on turning forces.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nThe events occur in the following order:\n\n  1. The speaker details factors that affect reaction/thinking time.\n  2. He acknowledges this information by saying \"okay\" and moves on to the next section.\n  3. While explaining the concept of braking distance, a swishing sound is heard, which could indicate an action related to the topic being discussed.\n  4. The speaker then provides an equation for calculating stopping distance, which involves both thinking and braking distances.\n  5. Finally, the speaker outlines the learning goal for the class, which is to identify the factors that influence thinking and braking distances.\n\nThe order of the options matches the sequence of events described above.",

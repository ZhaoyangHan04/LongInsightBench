    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is: (2) A title slide \"Weight Gain and Loss\" with an NSF logo appears with a steady drum beat. (1) Upbeat electronic music plays while the speaker says \"the character is up in the air\" over the Dynamic Weight slide. (4) The speaker calmly introduces \"dynamic weight\" on a static slide, with no background music. (3) The \"Measuring Weight Gain & Loss\" classroom scene appears; the speaker suggests using a digital force plate. (5) The speaker says \"let's look at the first clip\" as a grungy, slightly out-of-tune guitar plays and a \"Moving the Torso\" graph is shown.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n2 - The \"Counteraction\" slide with a Richard Williams quote appears; upbeat rock plays while the speaker explains hair and drapery move opposite the character.\n3 - Two women walk in slow motion; on-screen text tells viewers to notice the red-haired woman's hair; soft rock plays as the speaker directs attention.\n1 - A classroom demo on \"General Motion\" is shown; the speaker jokes it's \"more like flailing around\" before transitioning to a \"Character Effects\" slide.\n4 - An animated subway scene with Gloria and other animals plays; playful orchestral music accompanies the speaker referencing Madagascar 3 and noting she's lighter when going with gravity.\n5 - A split-screen of Gloria labeled \"With gravity\" and \"Against gravity\" appears; the speaker connects this to follow-through and drag.\n6 - A final white summary slide states weight varies with acceleration; the speaker distinguishes this from \"weight shift.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

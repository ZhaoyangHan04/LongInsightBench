    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\nFirstly, the narrator proposes to start with kinematics (Option A).\n\nSecondly, a chalkboard timeline about the evolution of kinematics appears, which includes a planet and a cannon (Option B). This indicates that kinematics has evolved over time and has applications in various fields such as astronomy and physics.\n\nThirdly, a blackboard listing d/x, v, a, and t appears as a female voice explains subscripts like V0 andVF (Option C). This shows that kinematics involves the study of motion and displacement.\n\nFourthly, a static blackboard titled “Kinematic Equations” appears as a male voice says the variables are out of the way (Option D). This indicates that kinematics also deals with equations that describe motion.\n\nFinally, a red car acceleration example (2 m/s² for 30 s) is presented while the narrator asks for final velocity and distance (Option E). This provides an application of kinematics to real-world scenarios.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is Option A (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n  1. The male speaker starts by calculating the time to slow down, which is done on the chalkboard. This event is followed by the speaker referencing simple algebra.\n  2. Next, the distance skidded during braking is shown on the chalkboard. This event is mentioned by the male speaker in relation to the position equation.\n  3. There is a brief, playful musical interlude played on the keyboard/synth.\n  4. After the music, the male speaker returns and announces that he has concluded the first part of the kinematics series.\n  5. A female speaker then previewed an upcoming video on vertical velocity, describing it as interesting and easier.\n  6. Finally, the same female speaker thanks viewers, encourages them to like, subscribe, share, and comment, and closes with a cheerful \"bye.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is option C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

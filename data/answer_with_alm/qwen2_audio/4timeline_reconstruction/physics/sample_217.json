This is followed by a discussion of theoretical versus experimental strengths, and finally, he returns to the topic of deformation mechanisms with a physical model. Throughout the video, he also mentions future plans and thanks the audience.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is: (1) The tablet shows a box labeled \"Single Crystal\" with arrow \"f\" while he explains applying force and calculating from area and bond density. (2) Cut to the man in front of a bookshelf saying you could calculate the theoretical value for the strength required to deform the crystal. (3) The diagram gains the text \"Strength, theoretical 5x more than experimental\" as he states the theoretical is five times the experimental and the model is wrong. (4) He says what he sketched is not the whole story while adding new arrows and circles to the tablet drawing. (5) He writes/annotates \"crystalline imperfection\" and mentions \"dislocation.\" (6) He describes imperfections moving step by step under an applied force while the force arrows and magnified lattice are shown. (7) He holds a lattice model and says the end result is the same, describing step-by-step breaking and reforming underlying plastic deformation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is: (4) The speaker begins by saying they'll look at \"energy of position\" as cars pass on a quiet street. (6) The word \"Momentum\" and its formula appear while the speaker notes momentum is zero for stationary objects. (1) The speaker explains a car on a hill has the potential to do work as the gravitational potential energy formula appears on screen. (3) As cars roll downhill, the speaker says \"momentum is gained\" while the kinetic energy formula 1/2 mv^2 is shown. (2) A coconut sits atop a yellow slide while the speaker says its momentum is zero. (5) The coconut rolls down the slide as the speaker says gravitational potential energy becomes kinetic energy and mentions friction.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is (4) At the yellow slide, the speaker concludes, \"People don't actually have wheels.\" (5) By a red wheeled machine beside a sidewalk, the speaker suggests a \"momentum factor\" assists runners. (6) On a new concrete path with colorful cylinders, the speaker says runners are a poor example and need more energy to accelerate. (1) In a grassy field with a flagpole and red flowers on a stone wall, the speaker states it's easier to remain in motion and says he'll elaborate later. (2) With a close-up of a big rock near the stone wall, the speaker explains a massive rock has more momentum than a pebble rolling down a hill. (3) On a street near the shop sign \"LE SHOP,\" the speaker introduces upcoming activities on momentum, gravitational potential energy, and kinetic energy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 6 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3.",

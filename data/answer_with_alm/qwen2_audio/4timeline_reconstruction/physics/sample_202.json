Then, she introduces the concept of the friction angle (phi) and labels the board accordingly.\n  3. A clattering sound interrupts her lecture, and she continues by deriving tan phi = μs on the board.\n  4. She then explains how the system changes when P is at an angle theta, noting that F can be zero in some cases.\n  5. After explaining the two-block example, where the red block moves up relative to the green one, she clarifies that friction acts down due to equal-and-opposite loads.\n  6. Finally, she emphasizes that there cannot be a friction force without a normal force, reinforcing the idea that these forces always act together.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option C: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

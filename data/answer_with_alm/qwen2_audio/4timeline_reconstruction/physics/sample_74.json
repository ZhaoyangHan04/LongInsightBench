    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is option D: 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5.\n\nThe video starts with the narrator discussing the net magnetic flux outside a circle and concluding that it's still zero. This event is represented in the timeline as option 2.\n\nNext, the narrator explains electric flux through a closed surface and shows ∮E·da = Qenc/ε0. This event is represented in the timeline as option 4.\n\nAfter that, the narrator shows a magnet with north and south poles and field lines, and asserts that magnetic flux through a closed surface is zero because monopoles don't exist. This event is represented in the timeline as option 3.\n\nThen, the narrator shows two charges (+ and -) inside a closed surface and says that the electric flux is zero. This event is represented in the timeline as option 4.\n\nFinally, the narrator shows both laws side by side and notes a noticeable difference due to electric monopoles but no magnetic monopoles. This event is represented in the timeline as option 5.\n\nTherefore, the order of events in the timeline is 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5.",

Event 5 shows the result of the demonstration, which leads to the explanation of field lines and closed loops. This process continues with events 1, 2, and 4, where the narrator provides additional context and elaborates on the concepts being discussed.",

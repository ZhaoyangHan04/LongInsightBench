Then, a close-up shot of a copper-colored solenoid appears (3), along with on-screen text explaining what a solenoid is. After this, there is a visual display of magnetic field lines around a solenoid (4), accompanied by the equation B = μ₀ n I. Finally, the speaker concludes the lecture (5).\n\nTherefore, the order of events is: a static title slide, a description of the ideal solenoid, a visual depiction of a solenoid, a demonstration of the magnetic field around a solenoid, and a concluding statement from the speaker.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: D: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5 -> 7\nThe event sequence starts with a diagram showing the axial-field formula, which is related to the topic of the lecture. This is followed by the speaker concluding the scenario by mentioning that a uniform magnetic field is created in practice using a solenoid. This sets the context for the subsequent events. Then, there is a shift to a visual representation of a cylinder with a color-coded heat map, which likely refers to the same scenario being discussed. Next, the speaker references an MRI and mentions that he has shown a computer map of the magnetic field inside an MRI solenoid. This provides additional context for the previous events. Finally, the image of a solenoid with labeled turns appears, along with a description of the relationship between the number of turns and the strength of the magnetic field. This completes the sequence of events.",

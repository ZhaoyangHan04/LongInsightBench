    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3\nExplanation: The audio starts with her welcoming viewers to a virtual tour, followed by crash footage showing airbags deploying. This indicates that option B, 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3, is the correct order. Next, she mentions a peak speed of 42 mph and a loud crash sound cutting in, which suggests that the virtual tour has started. Finally, she explains the results of a test on a dummy and a shock absorber, with air hissing, which brings us to the end of the sequence.",

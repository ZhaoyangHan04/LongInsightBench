    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nFirstly, Andy introduces himself as a gaffer, and a rewind sound effect plays during a split-screen with the bar scene (1). Then, an instructional male voice says, “let’s start… by firing up some lights,” as the bar brightens (2). Next, the on-screen title reads “FLAT LIGHTING,” while a male remarks there are too many lights for a dive bar and jazzy noir music begins (3). After that, the on-screen title “KEY LIGHT” appears and a male voice complains, “This doesn’t make sense with the lighting we’ve already established,” followed by an abrupt SFX (4). Finally, a split-screen compares “LIGHT FROM THE FRONT” vs “WITH LIGHT FROM BAR,” while a jovial male mentions a “Napoleon Cherry” (5).\nTherefore, the correct order is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n1. The “TOP LIGHT” section is explained with talk of practicals on camera, and an ominous sting plays.\n2. The “BOTTOM LIGHT” label appears as bleached muslin is used to diffuse underlight, with menacing organ-like music.\n3. The “SETTING THE TONE” section shows diffusion with silk and turning off fill; the narrator says, “There we go,” noting a moodier look.\n4. The “ADDIN G ATMOSPHERE” section adds haze that makes lights glow; a door opens and closes at the end.\n5. The “WORKING WITH Color” section proposes pink/blue neon-like accents and red for a sinister feel, accompanied by ominous music.\n6. A close-up of a check made out to Jean Reno is shown; later an outraged male voice insists, “I did not set that place on fire!” (Note: The check might be related to the previous scene, but there's not enough context provided to determine its relevance in this sequence.)\n\nTherefore, the answer is option D: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

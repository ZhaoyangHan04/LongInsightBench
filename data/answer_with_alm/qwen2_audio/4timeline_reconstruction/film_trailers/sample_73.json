    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option D: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6.\n\nFirstly, the indoor speaker starts by saying 'I'll talk about transporting cinema cameras with added handles/monitors/audio' (Option 2). This indicates that he is about to discuss a topic related to camera transportation. Then, the narrator asks whether to invest in a camera rucksack or a camera AV bag (Option 1), which shows an interest in camera bags. After that, there's a distinct honking sound that occurs (Option 3), which could be an indication of a scene change or an external event during the recording. \n\nMoving on, the speaker mentions that the AV bag even has an LED light (Option 4), which provides additional information about the features of the camera bag. Next, he explains that camera bags are a hybrid of a rucksack and a Pelican case (Option 5) and how his Komodo can be fully rigged inside (Option 6). Finally, a black screen with 'SUBSCRIBE' appears (Option 7), which could indicate the end of the video or a call-to-action for viewers to subscribe to the channel.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events is as follows",

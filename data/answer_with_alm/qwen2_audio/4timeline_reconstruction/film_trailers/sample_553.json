    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option D: 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3.\nFirst, we hear an announcer yell \"Undisputed Welterweight Champion of the World\" as a referee raises the winner's hand, indicating that event 4 has taken place. This is followed by event 5, where a reflective voice talks about walking miles in Nigeria for water while children carry yellow 'CHINA Water' containers on screen.\nNext, we hear voices predict a fight in November at Madison Square Garden while a red-capped belt holder speaks at a UFC ESPN desk beside a woman in pink, which indicates that event 1 has occurred.\nFinally, we have events 2 and 3. A male voice aggressively calls out \"Marty Fake Newsman\" over hip-hop while a man with a championship belt exits a black SUV with two women, which suggests that event 2 happened before event 3, where an excited voice previews Usman vs. Covington as the Titan Tak Productions \"Share & Subscribe\" card appears.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: C: 6 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5\nThe sequence starts with a man talking about bringing the belt to the White House, followed by a comment about a choke. This is likely related to a recent event, possibly a sports fight. The second part of the sequence involves a man making a vow to knock someone out before the end of the year, which could also be related to a sports fight. The third part mentions a nonstop offense and strikes, which further supports the idea of a sports fight. Finally, the sequence ends with commentary about two fighters in the octagon, which is where the actual fighting takes place in a sports fight setting. Therefore, the correct chronological order of the events is 6 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "Option B seems like the most likely answer based on the visual and auditory cues provided. Here's the reasoning:\n\nThe audio starts with a close-up of a man in a gray suit with two small umbrellas attached to his head at the bar (event 1). This suggests that event 1 happens first.\n\nNext, we hear children singing \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\" (event 2), which indicates that event 2 comes next.\n\nA sports announcer then mentions a \"Yankees crowd\" and \"extra innings\" (events 3 and 4), suggesting that these events occur after event 2.\n\nFinally, we see two men celebrating on a quiet residential street at night, with one lifting the other (event 5). Since this scene involves two men and no mention of a Yankees crowd or extra innings, it likely occurs after event 4.\n\nLastly, we hear a man in a gray suit sitting at the bar with a tiny umbrella in his ear, watching TV (event 6). This scene does not provide any specific timing information, so it could occur at any point during the previous events.\n\nFinally, we hear crowds cheering as a sports announcer declares the Cardinals have won (event 7). This implies that event 7 happens",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n1. A man in a brown suit with a flower stands at a house doorway labeled 1150, reading a paper.\n2. A man lies asleep on a couch under a green blanket.\n3. After a man invites someone to his room with posters, suspenseful orchestral music with struggle sounds erupts.\n4. A man pleads, \"I can explain everything,\" and a woman replies, \"Okay, explain everything.\"\n5. A man and a boy sit at a table; the boy holds a Lactose Free Drink with berries on a plate.\n6. A woman says, \"David, I think I'm gonna have to leave you,\" with dramatic strings swelling.\n7. A male voice says \"Whistler's mother,\" a female replies \"Whatever turns you on,\" accompanied by chewing.\n8. A young voice says, \"Hi beanie... Can't sleep? ... Can't stop thinking about naked women,\" followed by a male, \"Whoa.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is option C: 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 6 -> 8 -> 5 -> 7 -> 3.",

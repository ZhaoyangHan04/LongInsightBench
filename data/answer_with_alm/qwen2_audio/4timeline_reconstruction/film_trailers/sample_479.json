    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is: \n1. The host drops the trailer off on the other side of the gate. \n2. The camera moves down a cluttered BSG WRAPS hallway toward a bright area with a red vehicle visible. \n3. A speaker describes “preparation” for window visibility and greets “Steph” in a dark room. \n4. During the tour, the guide highlights all three printers, naming the HP Latex. \n5. The guide says “this is the air condition shop,” mentioning a laminator and the work table. \n6. Outside later, the host exclaims it’s “so freaking cool,” thanks BSG Wraps, and urges viewers to subscribe while showing the trailer. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

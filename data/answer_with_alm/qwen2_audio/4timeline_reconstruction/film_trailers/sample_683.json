    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on film and television for help. The original order of events is: The host greets viewers and announces she'll analyze the Wish teaser for Disney Easter eggs. Then, Asha says “What was that?” as a star rushes by in the forest. Next, the Disney 100 castle appears while the speaker enthusiastically describes kingdom details and references. After that, Valentino blows on a dandelion beside Asha on a balcony. Finally, the narrator calls his selective wish-granting “pretty evil.” Therefore, the answer is A: 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3.",

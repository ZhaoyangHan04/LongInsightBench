    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.\nThe first event is the upbeat social-banking jingle, which starts at 0.00 seconds and ends at 10.00 seconds. This is followed by the ndani.tv brand bumper, which starts at 1.79 seconds and ends at 6.83 seconds. Then, there is a male voice announcement, which starts at 7.88 seconds and ends at 10.00 seconds.\nAfter these events, we have the scene described in option C, where a man in a white suit on the maroon couch says he enjoyed playing a narcissistic character. This scene starts at 10.00 seconds and ends at 13.40 seconds. Finally, there is a split-screen subscribe prompt that appears with R&B-style outro music and “Powered by GTBank.” This prompt starts at 13.40 seconds and ends at 15.00 seconds.\nTherefore, the correct sequence of events is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

This sets the scene but does not provide any specific timing for the other events.\n\nNext, we have event (1), where the on-screen label “Tokunbo Tech Entrepreneur” appears as a male speaker explains creating characters from post-university struggles. This occurs after event (2) but before event (3).\n\nEvent (3) takes place during event (2), specifically between the time the waiter serves drinks and the female voice begins discussing relationship struggles.\n\nEvent (4) occurs after event (3), where Cinematographer Muhammad Atta discusses the crew size.\n\nFinally, we have event (5), where a male voice summarizes the show in three words. This occurs after event (4) but before the end of the audio clip.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4.",

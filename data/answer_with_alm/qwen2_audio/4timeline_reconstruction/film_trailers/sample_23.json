    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events in the video is:\n\nFirstly, we have an underwater expedition labeled \"Deepsea Challenge 3D,\" which occurs at the beginning of the video. This is followed by a discussion about the Alpha Centauri system, where a star-filled sky and a massive planet are shown. Then, there's a scene where the on-screen text \"A visit on earth?\" overlaps a close-up of a blue face as the speaker wonders about returning to Earth. After that, soldiers and a holographic mine site appear, along with \"new villains\" like colonists being discussed. \n\nWe then see a serene shot of a flying creature at sunset, and a female voice asks, \"What would you like to see in an Avatar sequel?\" This is followed by a scene with a 'Subscribe' scene with a red lightsaber wielder and a dinosaur, followed by credits and the suggestion to check other videos. Lastly, we see the original movie's avatar hit theaters and become an instant success.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is option D: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

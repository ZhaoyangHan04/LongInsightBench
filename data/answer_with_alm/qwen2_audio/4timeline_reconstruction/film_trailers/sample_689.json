Then, there is a scene showing top-down kitchen visuals with playful cartoon pops, where the speaker expresses their love for bananas (2).\nAfter that, a woman's voice is heard announcing the winner Aliya Khanem, along with a large red question mark graphic on the screen (5). This event seems to take place after the initial introduction and before the main segment involving the banana peel.\nNext, the man stops his time lapse and returns to normal speed to throw a banana peel into a trash bin (3). This occurs after the winner is announced but before the final segment with the fake FPV drone shot.\nFinally, the host appears on-screen again, mentioning the fake FPV drone shot and instructing viewers on how to export it (4). This marks the conclusion of the video.",

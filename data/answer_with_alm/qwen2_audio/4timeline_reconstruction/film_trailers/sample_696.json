    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \n1. The man offers to take the woman to the father-daughter dance, and upbeat pop music kicks in.\n2. The man, now clearly ill, coughs and vomits while insisting he’s fine to go to the dance.\n3. A woman cries “Dad!” as a man in a blue military uniform enters, prompting gasps.\n4. At a lively hat party, the uniformed man says he has to take an incredibly beautiful girl to a very special dance, and the crowd cheers.\n5. During the party in the kitchen, someone asks the plan now that “Colonel Dad’s in town,” and family activities are listed.\n6. Later amid the group, the uniformed man says he’s leaving tonight, and the woman announces, “I’m going to Italy!” with celebratory music.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.\nAt the hat-filled party, the woman declares her intention to go to Italy while celebratory music plays in the background. This sets the scene for the following events.\nIn the lively studio-like setting, co-hosts reveal that Carly is taking a break, but they also reassure the audience that it's not goodbye. This update is followed by the traditional farewell on the iCarly set, where Carly and Sam say goodbye to the viewers with jokes and cheers from the audience.\nAfter the farewell on the iCarly set, the group leaves the set with their luggage and shares hugs before saying goodbye. The woman then says \"I love you guys,\" and a car starts up and departs. This marks the end of the event where the woman decides to leave.\nFinally, on the airplane, a member of the crew announces that the flight will take off in about 25 minutes. At this point, Carly's voice emerges from a laptop, introducing their first webcast as the theme song plays. This marks the beginning of the new chapter in Carly's life after taking a break from iCarly.",

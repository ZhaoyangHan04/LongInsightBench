Then, in the school hallway, the blonde girl argues with the boy on crutches about \"foreign bacon,\" which ends with a dramatic rock swell. Afterward, on the iCarly stage, the boy talks about speeding up the site with an eight-core 3 GHz server, and the girl comments on it being cute and geeky. Next, in the retro room, the couple shares a kiss. Later, during a conversation about kissing or bumping up the server, they kiss again. The final event involves the boyfriend suggesting they wait before kissing and the audience cheering, followed by the sound of bicycle brakes squealing, a car door slamming, and the boyfriend driving off, leaving the girlfriend to reflect on what she has done.",

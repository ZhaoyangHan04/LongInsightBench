    "model_answer": "Answer: C\nThe chronological order of events in the video is as follows:\n\n  * In the introduction, a female voice mentions the periodic table and its importance, accompanied by visual aids such as molecular models.\n  * Next, the narrator explains the periodic table's structure, starting with the horizontal rows (periods) and the vertical columns (groups/families).\n  * As the narrator moves through the table, they point out specific elements and their properties, such as hydrogen's position and the color coding used to distinguish different categories of elements.\n  * Finally, the narrator provides additional context about the periodic table's organization and terminology, including the use of roman numerals and the concept of groups/families.\n\nTherefore, option C (4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3) correctly represents the order in which the events are presented in the video.",

    "model_answer": "The correct order is B: 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 6 -> 4 -> 3.\nThe video starts by discussing group 18 \"noble gases\" on a regular grid, followed by group 1 (alkali metals), which are described as very reactive and not found alone in nature. Then, a spiral table alternative is introduced, explaining connections among hydrogen, halogens, alkali metals, and noble gases.\nNext, the display shifts to a circular periodic table with color-coded labels as the narrator identifies transition and inner transition metals. Afterward, the narrator names group 2 as the \"alkaline earth metals,\" pretty reactive but more stable than group 1. Finally, the narrator states group 17 elements are the \"halogens\" and mostly diatomic.\nTherefore, the sequence of events is: group 18 noble gases, group 1 alkali metals, connection between groups, group 2 alkaline earth metals, and group 17 halogens.",

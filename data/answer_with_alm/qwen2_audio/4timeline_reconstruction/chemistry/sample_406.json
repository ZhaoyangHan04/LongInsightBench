Then, he shows diagrams of CO and CO2 with mass ratios, which corresponds to events 2 and 3. Next, a cartoon mole appears with the phrase \"Return of the Mole!\", which corresponds to event 4. Afterward, the slide titled \"Empirical Formula\" is shown, which corresponds to event 5. Subsequently, the screen displays HCl values and Î”EN, which corresponds to event 6. Finally, the \"Atomic Radius and Ions\" slide appears, which corresponds to event 7.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option B: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\nFirst, the narrator mentions that the molecular formula for hydrogen peroxide is H2O2, which comes before the filling of the beaker with water. This indicates that step 2 should come first.\nNext, the narrator discusses the empirical and molecular formula of water, which is H2O. This happens before the introduction of the HCl example, so step 3 should come after step 2.\nAfterwards, the narrator introduces the HCl example and explains how to determine its electronegativity difference. This occurs before the display of the HCl values and the discussion of bond radii, so step 4 should come after step 3.\nFinally, the narrator starts discussing atomic radius as an average bonding radius, which comes after the presentation of the HCl values and the bond radius trends. This indicates that step 5 should come after step 4.\nLastly, the \"Ionization Energy\" slide appears while the narrator defines the energy required to remove an electron and its trend across the table. This occurs at the end of the video, so it should be last in the sequence.\nTherefore, the correct order is 2",

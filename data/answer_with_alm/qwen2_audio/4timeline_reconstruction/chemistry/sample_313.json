The Sandmeyer and Gattermann reactions slide is shown while the speaker notes that Sandmeyer gives a better yield.\n4. The PHYSICAL PROPERTIES slide lists benzene diazonium chloride; the speaker calls it a colorless crystalline solid.\n5. The DIAZONIUM SALTS slide with resonance structures is shown as the speaker attributes stability to resonance.\n6. In the lab scene, the speaker introduces replacement by halide or cyanide ion and says nitrogen escapes as a gas.\n7. On the DIAZOTISATION slide, an added note warns against storing the salt while the speaker emphasizes immediate use.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 2 -> 7 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 3.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is option B: 2 -> 6 -> 7 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3.\nFirstly, on slide 2, the speaker introduces the topic of diazo compounds and their replacement by fluoride ions. Then, on slide 6, the speaker describes the reaction between diazo compounds and hydrofluoric acid to form diazomethane and hydrogen fluoride. This reaction is followed by the introduction of the diazo group into other compounds through various replacement reactions, such as with iodide ions (slide 7), hydroxyl groups (slide 7), and halogens (slide 4).\nAfter discussing these reactions, the speaker moves on to the synthesis of diazo compounds, which is demonstrated through the formation of diazo dyes using diazonium salts as intermediates (slide 5). Finally, the lecture ends with credits and a disclaimer (slide 3), along with background music (slide 9).\nTherefore, the correct order of the slides is 2 -> 6 -> 7 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3, leading to the formation of diazo dyes through diazonium salt intermediates.",

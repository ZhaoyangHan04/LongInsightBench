The second event is the introduction of finding rate laws and the experiment table. The third event is the highlighting of experiments where chlorine is held constant. The fourth event is the analysis of chlorine's effect on the rate. The fifth event is the conclusion of finding the exponent. The sixth event is solving for k and discussing units. The seventh event is the appearance of a screen explaining reactant orders.\nTherefore, the sequence of events is the presentation of background information, followed by the demonstration of how to find rate laws through experiments, and then the discussion of the results and implications.",

Then, event 2 is introduced where experiments 1 and 2 are compared with chlorine held constant. This leads to the discussion about doubling H2 doubling the rate, which is event 3. Next, event 4 occurs where the speaker uses experiment 1 values to solve for k on the whiteboard. After that, event 5 takes place where the speaker explains how to cancel out parts to clarify units. Finally, event 6 happens where the speaker writes the full rate law with K and mentions the units.",

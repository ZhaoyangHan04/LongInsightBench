    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5\nOption A is the correct answer. The timeline starts with event 3 where the alternative spectrometer arrangement is described, which repeats the absorption diagrams. Then event 2 takes place where a slit and a detector are added to the absorption setup. Event 1 follows where he explains how a slit selects a wavelength and a knob scans. Next, event 4 occurs where a monochromator is introduced, which consists of a prism and a diffraction grating, while a prism and a CD show rainbow spectra. Finally, event 5 happens where he switches to emission spectroscopy and describes electrons dropping in energy as a heating coil appears under the title.",

    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: (2) Upbeat intro music plays before the speaker introduces the spectroscopy series. (3) A brown object and a red wave appear as he says the particle model is poor and waves are a better (but imperfect) model. (4) The ‘spectroscopy’ definition slide appears as he explains energy transforming in molecules. (5) Two red wavy lines are shown as he defines light as oscillating electric and magnetic fields. (6) A red wave enters a complex molecular diagram as he discusses electric-field interactions and says magnetic ones will be in NMR later. (1) Graphs appear as he lists UV-Vis, IR, and rotational spectroscopy. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 1.",

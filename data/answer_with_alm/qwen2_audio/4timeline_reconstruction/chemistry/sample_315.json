    "model_answer": "The correct顺序是 A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5。\nFirstly, we see the equation (1) which represents the balanced chemical equation. Then, in (2), we have the enthalpy change for this reaction, which is exothermic as indicated by the negative sign. Next, in (3), there's a mention of 'stoichiometry,' suggesting that we're moving on to discussing the relationship between reactants and products in terms of their quantities. In (4), there's a mention of ' mole ratio,' which is directly related to stoichiometry. Finally, in (5), there's a brief summary of the concept of standard enthalpy change, which ties back to the initial equation and the discussion of energy changes.",

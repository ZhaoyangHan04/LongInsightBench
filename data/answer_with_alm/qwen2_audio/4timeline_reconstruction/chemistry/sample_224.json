    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: Speaker starts by identifying a replica of the first atomic bomb and mentions it caused a huge explosion (1). Then he explains how pieces of wood have energy that can be released by setting them on fire (2). Next, a slide appears explaining that there are two kinds of energy (3), which leads to the speaker mentioning that there are two types of energy (4). Finally, a slide defines potential energy with logs shown and the speaker refers to it as “type number one” (5). Therefore, the correct order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5. Option A correctly orders the events.",

    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6.\n\nThe first event is the moving red sports car, which triggers the speaker's curiosity about its kinetic energy. This leads to the second event where the speaker confirms that the car indeed has kinetic energy due to its motion.\n\nIn the third event, the focus shifts to the white showroom car with doors open. Since the car is stationary, the speaker states that it has no kinetic energy. However, he also acknowledges that there is still some form of energy associated with the car, which is referred to as potential energy.\n\nThe fourth event takes place on the same white car slide, where the speaker emphasizes that the car possesses potential energy because it can be moved around. This triggers the fifth event where the speaker introduces the concept of energy units, specifically the joule.\n\nFinally, in the sixth and last event, the speaker delves into the topic of calories as another unit of energy. As this segment progresses, credits start appearing, and acoustic guitar music begins playing in the background.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \n3 - The balanced vs unbalanced water equations are shown with a green check and red cross as the narrator defines a coefficient. (This event is represented by the appearance of the equation on the screen)\n4 - The blue title “Law of Conservation of Mass” appears as the speaker says mass is conserved in reactions. (This event is noted in the transcript but does not have a corresponding visual representation on the screen)\n2 - The red “REACTION EQUATION” label encircles 2H2(g)+O2(g)→2H2O(g) while the narrator mentions there are definitions to learn. (This event is represented by the equation on the screen)\n1 - The red “REACTANTS” and “PRODUCTS” labels appear under the water equation as the speaker explains reactants, products, and state symbols. (This event is represented by the labels appearing on the screen)\n5 - A slide titled “Balancing Chemical Equations Guide” about Fe and O2 appears while the speaker says there’s no guaranteed method but provides steps. (This event is represented by the appearance of the slide on the screen)\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option C: 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> ",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\nThe speaker starts by defining solute and solvent, which leads into the concept of molarity and dilutions. This is followed by the introduction of percent yield calculations, where the speaker shows the percent yield formula with a hand-drawn cat. \n\nAfter these explanations, the speaker moves on to define solubility and aqueous solutions, highlighting the difference between soluble and insoluble substances in water. This is followed by the definition of solutions and how they are created.\n\nFinally, the speaker ends the presentation with a summary slide that includes the goals of chemistry learning and a visual representation of a student's notebook with a red checkmark.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is option C: 3 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6.",

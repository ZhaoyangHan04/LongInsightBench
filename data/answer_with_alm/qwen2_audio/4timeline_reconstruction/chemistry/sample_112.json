    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is as follows:\n\nFirst, the speaker introduces the vinegar titration and mentions they will prime a burette (Option A is the correct answer). This indicates that the first step in the experiment is preparing the burette.\n\nNext, the speaker explains that distilled water will be used to coat the sides and liquid will be poured into a beaker labeled WASTES (Option B is the correct answer). This implies that after preparing the burette, the next step is to set up the experimental setup.\n\nAfterwards, the speaker announces that the burette has been primed and an initial reading of 0.5 mL is made (Option C is the correct answer). This indicates that the burette has been filled with the appropriate solution and its accuracy checked.\n\nThen, five drops of phenolphthalein are added to the flask on the stir plate (Option D is the correct answer). This step is necessary to visually monitor the progress of the titration.\n\nOnce the burette is opened, the early color changes are not yet persistent (Option E is the correct answer). This means that the acid-base reaction has not yet started.\n\nAs the titration progresses, a faint pink becomes more persistent, and the additions are slowed down to drops (",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events in the second titration run is:\n\n1. Filling the burette for a second trial and noting that 2.4 mL is fine (starting at non-zero).\n2. Adding vinegar, water, and phenolphthalein to the Erlenmeyer flask.\n3. Placing the flask on the stir plate and starting stirring.\n4. Beginning the titration with a large stream from the burette.\n5. Slowing down the flow using a split-drop technique to control the delivery of sodium hydroxide.\n6. Reaching the equivalence point with a faint pink color.\n7. Announcing the final volume as 44.5 mL, even though the stirred solution is still bubbling.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.",

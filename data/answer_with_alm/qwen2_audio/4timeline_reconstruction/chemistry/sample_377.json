    "model_answer": "The correct order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7\nThe video starts by explaining that there are two types of ways that atoms can come together to form compounds - covalent and ionic bonds. This is followed by a definition of covalent bonds as sharing valence electrons. Then, the concept of double covalent bonds is introduced, which involves sharing two pairs of electrons. Next, an electrostatic attraction diagram is drawn to illustrate the difference between covalent and ionic bonds. After this, the speaker moves on to discuss electronegativity and how it affects bond formation. Finally, the topic of molecular formulas is introduced, with water being used as an example. Therefore, the events in the video follow the order: introduction of bond types, definition of covalent bonds, discussion of double bonds, comparison of covalent and ionic bonds, electronegativity, and molecular formulas.",

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence of events is:\n\n1. The title “Ionic vs. Covalent” appears as the speaker discusses electron transfer causing charges and asks when each bond would set up.\n2. The speaker says covalent bonds form between non-metals while the blue text stating this is being written.\n3. The speaker says ionic bonds form between a metal and a non-metal as that red line is written.\n4. The speaker mentions differences in electronegativity will be covered later while the “Ionic vs. Covalent” notes are on screen.\n5. A new page titled “Molecular Formulas” appears and the speaker introduces molecular formulas, citing water.\n6. “WATER H2O” is written and the speaker explains it means two hydrogens and one oxygen.\n7. “GLUCOSE C6H12O6” is written as the speaker says six carbons, twelve hydrogens, and six oxygens.\n8. “Ca(OH)2” is completed with parentheses while the speaker explains the need for parentheses with polyatomic ions.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8.",

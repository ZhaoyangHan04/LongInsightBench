On a polyatomic ions slide with a Na2SO4 dissociation diagram, the narrator provides an example and then experiences a cough.\n3. A table of solubility rules for ions is displayed, along with a low-frequency hum in the background.\n4. The MCL table for drinking water is shown as the speaker references the Clean Water Act and regulations on toxic ions.\n5. The MCL table remains on the screen as the speaker notes that some compounds, such as lead and benzene, have extremely low acceptable levels.\n6. A schematic of a municipal water treatment facility appears as the speaker discusses various stages of water treatment, including primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5.\nFirst, the narrator introduces water as a universal solvent and mentions its polarity, which is shown on the screen with the title \"Water II.\" This event happens at the beginning of the video (0.00 seconds).\nNext, a white slide is shown with a periodic table, and the narrator explains charge balance in ionic formulas and the fact that transition metals can form more than one stable ion. This event happens between 0.00 and 5.89 seconds.\nAfter that, a slide is shown listing common monatomic anions, and the narrator discusses ionic compounds like sodium chloride and the nature of anions. This event happens between 5.89 and 7.83 seconds.\nThen, a diagram is shown showing NaCl dissolving into Na+ and Cl- surrounded by water molecules, and the narrator says that ions conduct electricity. This event happens between 7.83 and 10.00 seconds.\nFinally, side-by-side diagrams of distillation and reverse osmosis are shown, and the narrator notes that small-scale distillation mirrors the hydrological cycle.

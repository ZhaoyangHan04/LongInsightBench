    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: (2) The speaker greets and announces the topic “meso compounds and diastereomers,” with “180°” visible on the whiteboard. (1) The speaker defines a meso compound as having an internal plane of symmetry while the boy writes “meso compound” on the board. (3) The speaker introduces “diastereomers,” and the board now shows “Diastereomers” with OH and Br labels. (4) The board shows “Enantiomer” and “Achiral” as the speaker explains mirror images and rotations, noting multiple chiral centers don’t guarantee overall chirality. (5) The speaker says “this is not a meso compound” because it has a point of symmetry, while a diagram labeled A, B, C is on the board. (6) The speaker mentions “ten chiral centers,” thanks viewers, asks to subscribe, and signs off with “bye,” as the scene moves to a split-screen with graphics.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \n1. The interviewer says the words \"vacuum distillation\" during the initial lab conversation. \n2. A green slide titled \"Vacuum Source?\" shows Water Aspirator and Vacuum Pump illustrations. \n3. The narrator begins explaining the mechanics of an oil-immersion rotary vacuum pump. \n4. The pump diagram adds the label \"gas expelled\" with arrows indicating flow. \n5. Warning text appears: \"Never draw air through a vacuum pump.\" \n6. The narrator stresses the pump must never be open to the atmosphere and explains the need for a cold trap.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option D: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8.\nFirst, there's a green slide reading \"Check for star cracks,\" which suggests checking for physical damage before proceeding. Next, the narrator advises using flasks that can withstand evacuation and checking for damage. This implies step 2. Then, a green slide labeled \"Receiver adapter\" appears, suggesting step 3.\nAfterwards, the narrator mentions that the joints are sealed with vacuum grease and the setup is tested for leaks, which seems to be step 4. This is followed by a reminder about preventing bumping and then a description of connecting to the vacuum pump and regulating pressure while stirring for smooth boiling, which corresponds to step 6.\nFinally, there's a green slide listing the steps for reduced-pressure distillation, starting with heating slowly and collecting fractions, which seems to be step 8. This implies that steps 7 and 8 follow after steps 4 and 6, respectively.\nTherefore, the correct order is 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8.",

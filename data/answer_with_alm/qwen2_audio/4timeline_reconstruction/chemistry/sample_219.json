    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n1. The male speaker starts by introducing the goal of the experiment which involves synthesizing pure silicon dioxide and silicic acid using sodium silicate and hydrochloric acid. He also mentions measuring 40 mL of sodium silicate.\n2. Next, we hear the sound of water being poured into a large plastic bottle that is meant for full-scale use. This indicates that step 2 has taken place, where a greeting to \"Mrs. Saladcat\" is heard as water is added to the bottle.\n3. After this, the male speaker pours a bottle labeled \"Hydrochloric Acid 31%\" into the plastic bottle containing the sample. This indicates that step 4 has taken place.\n4. The speaker then notes that the mixture is now acidic after adding water and bubbling from a CO2 reaction is audible. This indicates that step 5 has taken place.\n5. Finally, the speaker adds 300 mL of sodium silicate solution to the bottle and discusses the acid amounts used. This indicates that step 6 has taken place.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is option B: 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 6 -> 1.",

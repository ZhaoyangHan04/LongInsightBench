    "model_answer": "Answer: C: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5\nThe video starts with the title screen appearing while the male speaker announces the lesson on spontaneous reactions. This indicates that option A (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6) is incorrect because the title screen does not have a specific order. Next, the speaker defines spontaneous processes and provides examples, which happens in slide 2. He then contrasts spontaneous with non-spontaneous processes, which occurs in slide 3. This means that option B (1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6) is also incorrect because it places the contrast between spontaneous and non-spontaneous before the definition of spontaneous processes. Option D (1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5) has the correct order of events, but it is incorrect because the order of slides 2 and 3 is reversed. Therefore, the correct answer is option C (2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is as follows:\n\n1. The narrator starts by discussing the preparation of a one molar solution of sodium chloride, which involves dissolving 2.92 g of NaCl in 50 mL of water.\n2. Next, a clear droplet of the prepared solution is deposited onto a black rectangular substrate in a petri dish using a pipette.\n3. The petri dish containing the droplet is then placed into a drying device with a digital display to allow the droplet to evaporate.\n4. After 24 hours, the evaporation process should be complete, and flat, square crystals should have formed on the glass slide.\n5. The narrator proceeds to grow more crystals by repeating steps 3-4 until the desired amount of crystals has been obtained.\n6. Once the crystals have grown, they are adhered to a holder using polymer clay and aligned for XRD analysis.\n7. Finally, diffraction patterns are taken for both \"NaCl powder\" and \"NaCl crystal on glass,\" and the speaker discusses the preferred growth orientation of the crystals.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is option C: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5 -> 7",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is as follows:\n\n1. The speaker starts by introducing NaCl's cubic lattice structure, which is demonstrated through the display of a labeled sodium chloride container.\n2. Next, the narrator mentions that the preferential growth direction of sodium chloride crystals will be determined using XRD and indicates that they plan to grow crystals from a 1 M solution.\n3. In a separate part of the video, we see sodium chloride crystals being crushed into powder in a mortar and pestle, which generates grinding sounds.\n4. The powder is then carefully spread onto an XRD sample holder to ensure that the top surface is flush.\n5. To prevent the powder from falling off during the experiment, the speaker instructs to keep the powder in the holder when it is tilted.\n6. At the XRD station, where there is a warning sign indicating a radiation hazard, the speaker explains how to adhere a glass substrate sample to a holder using polymer clay and align its top surface.\n7. Finally, the narrator introduces the measured diffraction patterns and asks about the preferred crystal growth orientation.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of events is option A: 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.",

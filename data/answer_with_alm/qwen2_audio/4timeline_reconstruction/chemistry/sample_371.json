    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the sub-events is:\n\n  1. The narrator greets and presents the tutorial's learning objectives on title slides (Option B).\n  2. The selection tool is used to copy and paste an ethane structure twice, noting the visible single C-C bond (Option D).\n  3. The text tool is used to type \"ethane\", \"ethene\", and \"ethyne\" below the structures (Option A).\n  4. The narrator converts a single bond to a double bond and calls the result ethene (Option B).\n  5. The narrator introduces tetrahedral geometry and says to press Ctrl+A to move the structures (Option C).\n  6. The narrator converts a single bond to a triple bond, and the narrator names the product ethyne (Option B).\n\nTherefore, the correct order is Option B: 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is as follows:\n\nFirstly, the user performs action 4: In the editor, the user adds three bonds and then hydrogen atoms by pressing capital H.\n\nSecondly, action 2 takes place: The narrator lists stereochemical bonds (wedge, hash, swiggle, four) and instructs using wedge then hash on ethane.\n\nThirdly, action 5 occurs: The Preferences window opens and \"Invert wedge hashes\" is checked while its effect is explained.\n\nFourthly, action 6 happens: The narrator says to add a hash bond to all bonds in ethane.\n\nFinally, action 3 takes place: The Summary slide appears, then the Assignment slide with tasks.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 1 -> 3.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it has action 5 before action 4. Option B is incorrect because it has action 3 before action 4. Option C is incorrect because it has action 3 before action 4. Option D is the correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is:\n\n1. Adds benzyl chloride to the hexamine solution on the hot plate.\n2. Starts reflux; boiling intensifies as water reaches boiling.\n3. Sees distinct layers and crystals forming in the condenser after the initial eruption.\n4. Opens the valve to separate the organic layer for further processing.\n5. Pours in 150 mL concentrated HCl, causing thick fog; plans immediate distillation.\n6. After distillation, notes about one-third product loss and neutralizes HCl with water/CaCO3.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \n1. Adjusts the distillation setup and remarks the distilled sample has a spicy smell with an overwhelming impurity. \n2. Separates and dries benzaldehyde with calcium sulfate, obtaining about 18 mL. \n3. State he intentionally tried to remove the impurity but couldn’t. \n4. Places benzaldehyde in the freezer; crystals form at −25 °C but filtering doesn’t fix the smell. \n5. Observes no liquid at about 10 °C and calls the oxidation rate impressive. \n6. Reports a failed vacuum distillation attempt to remove the impurity and ends the update. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

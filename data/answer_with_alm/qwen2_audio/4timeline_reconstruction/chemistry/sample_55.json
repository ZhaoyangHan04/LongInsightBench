    "model_answer": "The events seem to be related to a lecture on chemistry, specifically focusing on solvation and its relation to various factors such as polarity, Gibbs energy, and biological processes. Here's a possible chronological order based on the available information:\n\n(4) The speaker contrasts dissolution rate units (moles per second) with solubility (a concentration), which indicates that they are discussing the concept of solubility before moving on to other aspects of solvation.\n(2) On a pink slide with a Na+ hydration diagram, the speaker lists polar solvents like ethanol and acetone; a brief beep ends this segment. This suggests that the speaker is discussing the properties of polar solvents before moving on to other topics related to solvation.\n(5) A light-purple slide with δ-labeled water around Na+ appears as the speaker explains solvation is favored when Gibbs energy decreases. This implies that the speaker has already discussed the concept of Gibbs energy and its relevance to solvation.\n(3) The same pink hydration slide remains while the speaker links solvation to protein folding and biological processes. This suggests that the speaker is explaining the broader implications of solvation beyond chemistry and how it relates to biology.\n(1) The speaker mentions the Born equation while colorful test tubes reappear",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events in the video is:\n\n  1. The speaker starts by explaining host-guest complexation and drug-delivery applications, which is followed by showing two rows of colorful test tubes (bottom row red-lit).\n  2. Next, on a white screen titled “Solvation,” the speaker defines solvation and notes hydration is solvation by water.\n  3. As the speaker mentions donor numbers as a quantitative measure of solvation power, a pale-pink “Solution” slide with a hydrated Na+ appears.\n  4. While discussing a solvation shell and altered ordering around the solute, a pink hydration slide stays on the screen.\n  5. The speaker then refers to insoluble oxides and the lack of solvation, followed by mentioning the free energy of transfer.\n  6. Finally, as the speaker states that solvent polarity is the most important factor, a Na+ with δ-labeled water molecules is shown.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of the sub-events is option C: 2 -> 6 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1.",

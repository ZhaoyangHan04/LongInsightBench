    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events in the video is:\n\n1. The narrator mentions starting by dissolving stainless steel using a poor man's reflux, which likely involves placing the steel into a beaker containing a solvent like sulfuric acid and heating it on an induction hob.\n2. Next, the narrator mentions securing a paper or coffee filter over the beaker to trap any insoluble residue that forms during the reaction.\n3. After adding hydrogen peroxide and diluting it, the narrator notes that the reaction is vigorous but not particularly concerning.\n4. The narrator then explains that iron becomes insoluble hydroxide when exposed to sulfuric acid, and he plans to let this mixture settle before siphoning in a solution of sodium chromate. He warns that sodium chromate is a carcinogenic substance, so it should be handled with care.\n5. The narrator adds yellow chromate solution to the mixture and acidifies it with hydrochloric acid, which causes the solution to turn orange (due to the formation of dichromate).\n6. Finally, the narrator mentions that a dark liquid is added to the mixture, causing the solution to become deep blue. This liquid is likely sodium dichromate, which is used to stabilize the deep blue color. The narrator then boiling",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is:\n1. Boiling off hydrogen peroxide makes the solution safer.\n2. Sodium bicarbonate is added to the blue solution, causing fizzing.\n3. A coffee filter is used to filter a grayish chromium carbonate.\n4. Aluminum is attempted to be displaced in the filtered solution, but it's not reacting.\n5. The dark solution swirled earlier is shown as electrolysis has made it orange-red.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

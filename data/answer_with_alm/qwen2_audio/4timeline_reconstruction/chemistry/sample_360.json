A school announcement interrupts the speaker about social studies teachers while he is labeling energies on the whiteboard.\n2. The entire whiteboard graph is erased, leaving only the \"PE\" label, as he talks about the endothermic one.\n3. On a sheet of paper, he writes \"ΔH = P − R = 40 − 20 = 20 kJ\" and compares endothermics to adding money to a checkbook.\n4. He concludes, \"That should be it... everything you have to pull off a potential energy diagram,\" followed by a distinct slam sound as the whiteboard with the methane equation is shown.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n1. The speaker starts by saying everything viewers need to know about potential energy diagrams, which sets the context for the rest of the video.\n2. Next, he writes 'downhill = exothermic' on the diagram and provides an explanation for why this is the case based on the shape of the potential energy curve.\n3. After explaining collision theory and calculating activation energy, he moves on to annotate the diagram with relevant data such as delta H and numbers like 60 kJ and 30 kJ.\n4. Finally, he notes that 30 kilojoules have been released and mentions that the container temperature has risen during the process.\n5. In his notes, he calculates the activation energy as 60 kilojoules and contrasts it with another example that was only 20 kJ due to its exothermic nature.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

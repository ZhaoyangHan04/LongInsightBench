    "model_answer": "The events should be arranged based on their mention in the audio, followed by any additional relevant information provided in the question choices.\nAnswer: C: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6\nThe first event mentioned is the photochemical synthesis slide, which likely occurred early in the presentation. This is followed by a discussion of the reaction mechanisms and optimization, including the use of epoxide-olefination reactions. The third event involves the display of a slide related to the boronic ester synthesis, which occurred after the optimization process. The fourth event involves the comparison of fluorescence spectra between resveratrone and its isoresveratrol derivative, which suggests that this was done after the boronic ester synthesis but before the click labeling step. Finally, the last event involves the display of a click-ready isoresveratrol derivative scheme, which implies that it was prepared after the previous steps were completed.",

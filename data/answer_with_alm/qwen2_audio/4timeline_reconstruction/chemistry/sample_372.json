(3) The female speaker adds red litmus to the first water container and says there is no color change. (4) The female speaker adds blue litmus to the second water container and says there is no color change. (5) A blackboard slide writes “Neutral: No Colour change,” and the male voice calls a coming question “slightly tricky,” inviting a pause. (6) A close-up of red and blue litmus paper strips appears as the male speaker explains litmus paper is paper dipped in litmus solution and summarizes the acronyms.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> 6.",

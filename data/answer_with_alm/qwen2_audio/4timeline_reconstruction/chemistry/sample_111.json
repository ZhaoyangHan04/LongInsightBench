NaCl using Pt electrodes\" on the board, indicating that they are discussing electrolysis reactions.\nNext, the lecturer says a reaction forms \"sodium amalgam,\" which is a result of the electrolysis of sodium chloride.\nAfterwards, the lecturer writes \"Electrolysis of H2SO4\" and \"Low current density\" on the board, suggesting that they are comparing the electrolysis of different substances.\nFinally, the lecturer states \"current density is high\" and describes HSO4− forming H2S2O8, indicating that they are discussing the high current density observed in the electrolysis of sulfuric acid.\nLastly, the lecturer names \"peroxodisulfuric acid\" and \"peroxomonosulfuric acid,\" which are the products formed during the electrolysis of sulfuric acid.\nTherefore, the chronological order of the sub-events is as follows: the lecturer writes about the electrolysis of sodium chloride, followed by the discussion of the formation of sodium amalgam, then the comparison of electrolysis reactions, leading to the mention of high current density",

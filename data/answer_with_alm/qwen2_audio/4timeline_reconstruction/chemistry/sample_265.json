    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events in the lab experiment is:\n\n1. Copper(II) sulfate reacts with iron to produce pure copper and iron sulfate.\n2. The reaction mixture is stirred to speed up the process.\n3. White anhydrous copper sulfate is added to hot water, which turns the solution blue.\n4. The heat is turned off and the beaker is moved to cool.\n5. After stirring, the copper product settles to the bottom of the beaker, forming a layer of beautiful copper.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of events is option B: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "Weighing events typically occur after filtering events, so we can eliminate options A and C because they have the weighing process before filtering. We also know that the final result is the weight of the copper, which should come after all other steps. Therefore, the correct order is 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

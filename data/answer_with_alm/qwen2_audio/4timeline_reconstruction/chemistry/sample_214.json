    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is A: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8.\nFirst, the title card indicates that heating with the addition of reagents comes first. This is followed by the Claisen adapter being used and the condenser being placed on the sidearm as per the female narrator's instruction in the video.\nNext, there is a title card showing the reaction setup for reflux with the addition funnel. The female narrator then instructs to add reagent to the dropping funnel and introduce it through the stopcock.\nAfterwards, the title card shows the setup for reflux with a drying tube. The female narrator explains how to prepare the drying tube and uses a heat gun to drive out moisture before cooling it.\nThe next title card refers to the setup for reflux with the removal of unwanted gases. Finally, the female narrator advises dealing with noxious gases using either a fume hood or a gas takeoff adapter with gentle vacuum.\nTherefore, the sequence of events is as follows: heating with the addition of reagents (1), setting up the Claisen adapter and condenser (2), adding reagent to the dropping funnel and introducing it through the stopcock (3), setting up the",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.\nFirstly, the screen displays \"Heating Under Inert Atmosphere\" which indicates that the setup is being prepared under an inert atmosphere. This is followed by the process of filling an elastic balloon using argon through a syringe or a three-way stopcock, as described by the female narrator.\nNext, the male narrator explains how to connect a three-way stopcock to an inert gas cylinder, fill the balloon, insert it into a flask, and purge with a vacuum line. This step follows the preparation of the balloon.\nAfterwards, a graphic labeled \"Dean and Stark Trap\" appears, which refers to the Dean-Stark trap used in the reaction setup. This trap is used for azeotropic distillation and separating liquid-liquid mixtures based on their boiling points.\nFinally, the female narrator explains the operation of the Dean-Stark trap, including the azeotrope collection and monitoring progress by observing the change in water volume or milkiness. Therefore, the correct sequence of events is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

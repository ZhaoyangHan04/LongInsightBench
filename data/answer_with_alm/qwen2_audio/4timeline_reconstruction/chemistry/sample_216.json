    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is: \n1. The female voice starts by introducing stoichiometry topics and mole ratios. This sets the stage for the subsequent events related to chemical reactions and stoichiometry.\n2. Over a slide showing a mac & cheese recipe, a male voice asks about the amount of cheese needed for 10 people. This indicates that the topic of the lesson involves cooking and chemistry, which is relevant to stoichiometry.\n3. A female voice then explains the Haber-Bosch process, using a 1:3:2 ratio and mentioning Windex. This provides additional context for the concept of mole ratios and their application in chemical reactions.\n4. A slide defines \"mole ratio\" as a permanent ratio from coefficients, with the equation N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3 shown. This reinforces the idea of mole ratios and their importance in stoichiometry.\n5. A male voice asks how many moles of NH3 are created when 0.4 mol of N2 is used. This leads to a demonstration of how to calculate mole ratios and solve problems related to stoichiometry.\n6. The final slide shows the solution for this problem as 0.8 mol NH3. This concludes",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n1. A male voice notes stoichiometry is found in many video games while a crafting interface screenshot is shown.\n2. A slide with N2 + 3H2 ↔ 2NH3 and grey mole-info boxes appears as a female explains reactants should equal products.\n3. The “STEPS TO STOICHIOMETRIC EQUATIONS” slide is on screen while a male says to identify the known and the unknown and ignore irrelevant substances.\n4. For the 0.4 mol N2 problem, a male says hydrogen will be disregarded when setting proportions as the table for X (ammonia) is shown.\n5. In the 1.6 mol NH3 problem, a female sets X for moles of H2 and says nitrogen is ignored.\n6. A female states “2.4 moles of hydrogen” after cross multiplication, and a male compares it to needing a smaller recipe for fewer people.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

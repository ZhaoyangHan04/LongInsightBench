The events are as follows: First, the TICTACLEARN.ORG logo appears while whimsical xylophone-like intro music plays; then, a bell clang is heard as the speaker says “valency,” with the word “Valency” shown; thirdly, the blue-text rule “The positive ion is written first” appears on the green rules slide; fourthly, a short digital “ding” occurs during the HCl example as H+ and Cl− (both valency 1) are discussed; lastly, the example “Calcium Oxide (CaO)” is shown with Oxygen marked “Non-Metal,” followed by a playful musical cue.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

The H (1) and S (2) valencies for hydrogen sulfide appear with arrows as gentle background music plays.\n3. Mg2+ and Cl− are shown crossing to form MgCl2 while upbeat, playful music plays.\n4. A ding emphasizes the sodium carbonate example, showing Na2CO3 with a note about not using brackets.\n5. Brackets are shown around OH in Ca(OH)2, and a digital notification tone follows.\n6. A slide reads “We learned to write chemical formulae,” the next topic is announced, and light upbeat music begins.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6.",

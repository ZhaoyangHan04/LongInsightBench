Then, he stands at a whiteboard labeled \"Resonance Structures\" and points with a yellow marker (2).\nNext, an easier method to find formal charge by comparing typical valence electrons is introduced (3). This is followed by a statement about oxygen having six valence electrons and molecules being drawn with two-headed arrows (4).\nAfter these explanations, the line \"individual resonance structures do not exist\" is stated amid bubbling lab sounds (5). The presenter then briefly touches his head while standing at the whiteboard (6).\nFinally, the presenter ends on an enthusiastic outro inviting viewers to like, comment, and subscribe (7).",

    "model_answer": "The correct order of events is:\n\n1. The boy first appears seated in a plain room, addressing the camera.\n2. He stands at a whiteboard titled \"Resonance Structures\" and begins pointing at it.\n3. A simpler method for identifying formal charges by comparing typical valence electrons is explained.\n4. The explanation covers swapping formal charges and drawing molecules with two-headed arrows.\n5. The statement \"individual resonance structures do not exist\" is heard with bubbling background sounds.\n6. He draws stick-figure-like resonance structures on the board using arrows.\n7. The speaker says, \"And so with that, that's all there is to...\" before mentioning the resonance structures.\n8. An enthusiastic outro invites viewers to like, comment, and subscribe, and he is wearing a dark jacket over a yellow shirt.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8.",

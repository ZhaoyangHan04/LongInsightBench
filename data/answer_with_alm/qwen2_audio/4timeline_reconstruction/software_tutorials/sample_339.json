    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n  1. The user searches for the Phone app and moves it to its usual place, saying he'll put it in the right spot and then looks for the SMS app.\n  2. After the transfer completes, the receiver shows \"Transferred successfully\"; he says he doesn't want to rate the app and notices a \"message missing\" prompt he can't tap.\n  3. He opens the music/Spotify app and confirms songs and albums are present while stating it's still indexing; the playlists differ by language on the two phones.\n  4. He compares the two home screens, noting the wallpaper is the same and a dark theme is applied, but the calendar and some apps are missing or misaligned.\n  5. He concludes the video about Mi Mover and invites questions in the comments while an overlay lists the recording/editing devices.\n  6. He opens Photos on both phones and observes that not all photos transferred, though some did.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5.",

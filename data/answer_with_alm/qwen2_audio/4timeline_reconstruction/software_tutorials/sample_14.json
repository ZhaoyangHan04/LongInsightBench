    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4\nOption A is the correct answer. Here's why:\n\n- The video starts by comparing the wattage differences between the AMD Wraith Stealth and Wraith Spire coolers, which happens in the first few seconds.\n- Next, the user goes into a BIOS interface and enables XMP and adjusts DRAM frequency/timings while listening to laid-back background music, which occurs later in the video.\n- After adjusting the BIOS settings, the user saves a profile named \"3.1\" on a Gigabyte BIOS screen, and then opens a System Stability Test in Windows to stress the system. This sequence happens next.\n- Finally, back at the desk, the host presents a cheat sheet listing target CPU frequency/voltage and wraps up with thanks. This is the last part of the video.\n\nTherefore, the events in the video follow the order of option A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.",

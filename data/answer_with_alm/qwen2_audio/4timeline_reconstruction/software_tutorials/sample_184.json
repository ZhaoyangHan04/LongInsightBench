(2) The female interviewee begins talking about using local resources like the sun, wind, and rain. (3) The user selects a section of the video that will be replaced with images and deleted. (5) Four related images are inserted into the project, and their total duration is matched to the removed section. (6) The user exports the audio for the imported images, and electronic music begins playing as it fades in. (7) The editor splits the remaining clip and deletes some parts, referring to the duration numbers on the screen. Therefore, the correct order is option A: 4 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 3.",

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence of events is:\n\nFirstly, the event that led to the current state of affairs was the speaker suggesting getting a Bitcoin wallet, which prompted me to look up how to get one. I found instructions on the Pirate Bay, which led me to visit duckduckgo.com. After that, I searched for the best onion sites using duckduckgo, which brought me to the Hidden Wiki's commercial services section. This was followed by a loud noise and music, after which I visited the Hidden Wiki's main listings. I saw categories like Wikileaks, drugs, etc., but soon realized that some of them were illegal, so I closed the page. Lastly, I clicked on an ExpressVPN blog post that listed onion sites, which brought me back to the Hidden Wiki's main listings.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is: 2 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 7 -> 1 -> 4. Option B seems to be the closest match to this sequence.\n\nAnswer: B",

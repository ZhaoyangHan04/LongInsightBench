    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option B: 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 6 -> 3.\nFirstly, the phone prompts the user that they are already a developer, which happens in step (2). This is followed by the speaker mentioning that they have a new phone with a camera that picks up their face, indicating that the new phone event happened after the other events mentioned.\nNext, the speaker explains how they fixed the limited storage issue on their Android phone, which is described in detail in the video. This event comes last in the list because it is the main topic of the video.\nFinally, the steps listed in option B follow each other logically in the process of fixing the storage issue on the Android phone. First, the device appears unauthorized when connected to the computer via USB, prompting the speaker to unplug it. Then, the speaker switches carriers from Verizon to T-Mobile. After that, the USB debugging connection is established, and the web browser opens to display the necessary download links for the Java JDK and Android SDK.",

Then, the camera menu appears on the screen, showing full HD frame-rate options. The host explains cinematic 25fps versus higher-fps slow motion. After that, the host introduces 4K on the 250D, stating that it's the best resolution but has weaker autofocus and is best for studio use. The menu is then switched to 4K, and a warning appears that options are limited. The host mentions that there are four autofocus options. Next, the host demonstrates face tracking, keeping a box on the subject's face while a live view shows a person speaking. Finally, eye detection AF is toggled in the menu, and the host says it locks focus onto your eye.",

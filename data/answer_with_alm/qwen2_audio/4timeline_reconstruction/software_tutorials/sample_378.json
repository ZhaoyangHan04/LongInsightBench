    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n  1. The presenter introduces five privacy programs, noting PeerBlock is Windows-only, while icons are shown and the cursor focuses on the TOR icon.\n  2. On Chromium’s incognito/new tab info page, the presenter explains it won’t store history or cookies after the session.\n  3. With Craigslist and the browser history visible, the presenter says Craigslist still retains IP addresses, so closing the window only protects local data.\n  4. The Vidalia/Tor control shows “Connecting to the Tor network” as the presenter explains Tor reroutes traffic through multiple computers to protect identity.\n  5. The Tor check page shows “Congratulations. Your browser is configured to use Tor,” and the presenter adds it has incognito-like behavior and is set up to use Firefox.\n  6. Craigslist is visited through Tor while the presenter says the unique IP makes it hard to find where he is, and that closing Tor is all he needs to do.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6.",

Freenet shows “Freenet is starting up” and bookmarks while the presenter describes it as a decentralized, peer-to-peer internet that uses disk space to host content.\n  5. While the Freenet interface and then the icon screen are shown, the presenter talks about sharing links/files in private networks and usage under heavy censorship.\n  6. The icon screen returns and the presenter wraps up, inviting viewers to check a cryptography/data security video and wishing a nice day.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

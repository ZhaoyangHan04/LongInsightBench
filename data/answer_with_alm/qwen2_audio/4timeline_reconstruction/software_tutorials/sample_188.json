    "model_answer": "The correct order is C: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5. \n\nThe event 3 'DIAL IN GAIN Settings' starts when the sound of a distorted clipping example is playing, which indicates that this step was taken before adjusting the gain settings. Event 2 'On the motorcycle, a red cable is connected and both the recorder and camera are turned on' follows next, indicating that the cable connection and turning on the equipment happened after setting the gain. Event 1 'Black screen shows \"Direct Line-In\" as the method is named aloud' comes last, indicating that the line-in method was chosen after all other steps were completed. Finally, event 4 'The speaker advises plugging in headphones to hear background noises the mic is picking up' happens after the selection of the recording method but before testing the audio quality. Option C correctly reflects this sequence.",

This confirms that the previous statement was a tease for a demonstration at the end of the video.\n4. There are whole bunch of portable recorders on the market. This is a separate statement about the variety of recording equipment available, not related to the order of events in the video.\n5. Have a research on audio quality and find the one that suits you and your budget best. This is another separate statement encouraging viewers to research and choose their own recording equipment based on their needs and preferences.\n6.

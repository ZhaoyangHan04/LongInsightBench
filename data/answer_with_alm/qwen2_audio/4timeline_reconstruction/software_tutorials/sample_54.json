On the Crystallite Size Broadening slide, the speaker warns not to use degrees instead of radians.\n3. In Excel and Notepad, the speaker says “oops” while copying XRD data into the spreadsheet.\n4. In Origin, a graph of intensity vs 2θ is plotted as the speaker says the most intense peaks should be analyzed.\n5. The speaker guides going to Analysis → Peaks and Baselines → Multiple Peak Fit, selecting Gaussian, and fitting until converged in Origin.\n6. The speaker states the FWHM values “0.199 and 0.21” after fitting two peaks.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

On an Excel screen, the speaker recommends using Origin and notes older versions might not work, with a ringing sound in the background.\n  2. In Origin, the speaker says to include background radiation on both sides while zooming into a peak.\n  3. A Gaussian-fit table with parameters (y0, xc, A, w) is visible as the speaker mentions creating “another graph.”\n  4. The speaker demonstrates selecting multiple peaks via Analysis → Multiple Peak Fit → Gaussian and opens the non-linear fit.\n  5. The speaker says many iterations couldn’t fit a third peak and advises focusing on the most intense peaks.\n  6. The speaker thanks viewers and asks to subscribe as the end screen with “More Videos” appears and music starts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "Option B seems like the most likely answer based on the sequence of events described in the audio:\n\n1. The host first mentions seeing an Instagram ad of Timbaland, which suggests that event 1 occurred before event 2.\n2. In event 2, the host is seen sitting at his desk with a DAW, microphone, and keyboard, suggesting that he has gone into Logic Pro X to add ear candy and chords.\n3. Event 3 occurs after event 2, as the host describes what he's doing in the DAW.\n4. In event 4, the speaker adds drums, panned hi-hats, a beatboxing perk, and then a sub-bass as the hip-hop beat plays.\n5. Finally, event 5 occurs after event 4, as the host recommends the Masterclass after referencing Jay-Z's reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order of the sub-events is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

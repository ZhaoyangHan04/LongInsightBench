A host asks, “So what exactly is a clip?”\n3. The “Create clip” window appears and a title is typed in.\n4. A Share Clip pop-up with social icons and a URL appears.\n5. In the clip-view page, the speaker says it loops, and the video segment repeats between pointers.\n6. The presenter exits clip view by tapping the “X,” and the video resumes.\n7. During a PUBG live stream, the clip button pulls the last 15 seconds.\n8. The Clips tab is opened to manage created clips via the three-dot menu.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8.",

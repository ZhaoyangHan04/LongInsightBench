She greets the audience with \"what's up you guys welcome back to the channel\" as the peach-colored screen transitions to her at the mic.\n  2. While the ReShade website with a prominent purple \"Download\" button is shown, she says the current version is \"ReShade 4.9.1.\"\n  3. Inside The Sims 4, she tells viewers to press the Home key, skips the tutorial, and selects the downloaded .ini preset.\n  4. She shows a preset file with a gear icon in File Explorer and moves the preset into the The Sims 4 Bin folder.\n  5. In-game, she assigns a toggle key (End) and verbally compares the image as \"super dull\" without ReShade versus \"super bright\" with it.\n  6. She narrates browsing to This PC > Windows (C:) > Program Files (x86) > Origin Games > The Sims 4 > Game > Bin, while the File Explorer shows those folders.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

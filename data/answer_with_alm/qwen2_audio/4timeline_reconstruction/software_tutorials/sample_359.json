Then, he sets a texture coordinate tiling default to 0.5 for micro variation, which comes next. After that, he blends microcolor and microcolor variation into Base Color, saves, and previews the result. This event follows the initial promise of techniques, so it must be the third event.\nNext, he adds macro variation noise with a “noise contrast” parameter and compares results. This event comes after the previous one where the base color was created, so it must be the fourth event.\nFinally, he remarks it’s almost impossible to tell it’s the same tiling texture, then demonstrates tiling on a long landscape strip. This event follows the addition of macro variation noise, so it must be the fifth event.\nThe Patreon supporters end card appears as he asks for a thumbs up and subscription, which marks the sixth and final event in the tutorial. Therefore, the correct order of events is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

This implies that he has already created a grass texture that needs improvement. \n\nSecond, he renames a vector parameter to “micro-variation tint” and sets it to a pale yellow. This indicates that he is modifying the color of his grass texture. \n\nThird, he creates a macro variation blend with T_macro and a Lerp using its red channel. This suggests that he wants to create a gradient within his grass texture. \n\nFourth, he builds a distance-based gradient (pixel depth → subtract/divide/clamp) to blend near/far textures. This implies that he wants to create a more realistic effect by blending different textures based on their distance from the camera. \n\nFinally, he wires near/far lerps using the gradient as alpha and applies a material instance to a second landscape. This step likely involves applying the gradient-based blending to another landscape object.",

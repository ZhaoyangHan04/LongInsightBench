This indicates that step 2 (creating a new form) should come first. Then, the instructor mentions selecting 'form properties' which corresponds to step 5. After that, the class name is mentioned, so step 4 (class name) must follow. Next, the main window is referenced, which corresponds to step 1. Finally, the instructor goes over the header source, so step 6 (header source) must be last. Therefore, the correct order is 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 3.",

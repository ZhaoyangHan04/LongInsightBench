    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is: \n1. The title 'HOW I ADD REFRIGERANT' appears and an explosion sound plays.\n2. The on-screen overlay 'TALK TEMPERATURES NOT Pressures' appears as he says a 40-degree evaporator won't freeze.\n3. The HVACRSchool.com webpage is shown as the speaker quotes Brian Orr about preventing coil freezing.\n4. A digital scale reads '0.0 lbs. Tare' while he emphasizes resetting and using a scale.\n5. Gauges are shown with arrows as he advises letting about two pounds in and waiting 5–10 minutes after opening the suction side.\n6. Rock outro music plays with a 'You're watching...' voiceover while someone points to an orange R-407C label.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n1. The speaker contrasts 'ONLY 8'' with '18'-22' IS IDEAL' while reporting an ~8-degree temperature split using a probe.\n2. He states the ideal temperature split is 18–22 degrees and mentions checking the suction line for 'beer can cold.'\n3. He instructs hooking hoses to the liquid and suction lines, warning about blowback.\n4. Colored-ring gauges are shown as he says the evaporator coil is about 20 degrees.\n5. With gauges on screen, he says to dial in subcool to the manufacturer's recommendation, targeting ~40–42°F (125 PSI) low side and ~15°F above outdoor on the high side.\n6. He tells you to get amp draws and cycle the thermostat, ending with 'you're good to go.'\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6.",

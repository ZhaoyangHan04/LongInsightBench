This is followed by showing the MEGA page with the file name and download buttons. After that, the file is downloaded and extracted using WinRAR or 7-Zip, which is shown in step 3. Once the file is extracted, the Mod Manager is opened in step 4, and the user imports the mod file and applies it, as explained in step 5.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of steps is: Pick a download link -> Wait for download -> Extract the file -> Open Mod Manager -> Import and apply the mod.",

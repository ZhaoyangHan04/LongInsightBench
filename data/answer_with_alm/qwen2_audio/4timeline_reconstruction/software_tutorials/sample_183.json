    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n1. In MeshLab, a texture parameterization filter is applied and “Apply” is pressed; a big grid overlay appears on the model.\n2. The object is exported to OBJ and opened in MeshLab as a quicker unwrapping method.\n3. The processed OBJ is imported back into Blender with texture coordinates enabled; in Edit Mode a gridded UV map is visible and a confirmation sound plays.\n4. In the shader editor, a new material and an image texture node are added; a new black image with alpha 0 is created but left disconnected for baking.\n5. Bake settings are configured: Cycles GPU, Diffuse, Selected to Active, ray distance 0.1, margin 1 px.\n6. Baking starts; a progress bar is visible and a whooshing sound is heard.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.\nFirst, the speaker mentions that when the TV shows a \"No Signal\" message on HDMI 2, it's recommended to connect it wirelessly via WiFi. This implies step 1 should come first.\nNext, the updated SmartThings app opens and reaches the home screen after the welcome page. This indicates step 2 should follow.\nAfter that, in SmartThings, the user taps \"+\", selects Add device by type, chooses TV, and selects the location/room. This corresponds to step 3.\nFinally, the phone shows a PIN entry keypad; the TVâ€™s PIN is entered and a success message confirms the connection. This means step 4 comes last, followed by step 5 where the phone's device list shows the TV added (named for the living room).",

Then in option 1, the narrator reveals the three secrets of starting the DC-3. Option 3 describes the plan to keep the avionics master off during power-up and on to record intercom audio. In option 5, there is an external shot showing a prop spinning as the pre-oiler brings oil pressure up. Finally, in option 6, the engine noise builds and an exterior shot shows a prop spinning as they say \"go to avionics on.\" Lastly, in option 4, they start engine number two using the pre-oiler, followed by a celebratory \"Woohoo!\"",

Then, he explains the ignition master controlling the magnetos and compares the mag positions to a Cessna 172. Next, he identifies the starter, primer, pre-oiler, boost pump, and generator switches on the panel. He remarks that all the knobs and controls are “big,” noting it’s from “’38.” After that, he states the plan to keep the avionics master off during power-up, then on for intercom audio. Only the pre-oiler is on: a close-up gauge shows oil pressure rising while he says no propeller is turning. Finally, after both engines are running, they switch to ship power and mention the after-start and pre-taxi checklists.",

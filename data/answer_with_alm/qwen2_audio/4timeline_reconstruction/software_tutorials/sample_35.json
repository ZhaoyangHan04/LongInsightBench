On the Broadcast Gameplay screen (720p High shown), he comments about 1080p fairness and then the audio fades to silence.\n2. He explains you can invite friends via PlayStation and that you can share the stream.\n3. He explains a checkbox can auto-post to Facebook/Twitter (if linked) to announce you're live with a link.\n4. The stream is live on Warzone with an ON AIR indicator and a face overlay; ominous background music plays while he advises reading chat on another device.\n5. He says, \"This is actually streaming to Twitch right now,\" then stops the broadcast and says he's no longer broadcasting; the gameplay returns to full resolution.\n6. In Account Management > Link with Other Services, he shows the Twitch linking/unlinking area with a brief rock music interlude.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: She opens the tutorial with “Hey guys… welcome back,” encouraging subscribers as upbeat pop music plays. Then she says “find a sound on TikTok” while showing a phone gallery with 13,542 photos and a highlighted “East Butherford” video. After that, she opens the Video Star app and starts a new edit (Plus → Edit Video → Make Video). Next, she discusses a “ghost” transition and confirms “Create mix clips” with “Yes.” Following that, she exports the ghost transition by pressing Create and sending it to the camera roll. On TikTok, she trims two clips to where she goes down/starts going up and confirms with the check mark. Finally, she adds the sound named “Hold On” and invites viewers to watch the finished video as soft piano vocals play. Therefore, the correct sequence is option A: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.",

Next, she says she'll split the video into two parts and cut her sound; the edit timeline and a volume slider appear. After that, she makes one clip slow motion and taps Done. Lastly, using a multilayer clip, she adds a soft-edged mask to erase one “ghost”. She creates the clip, confirms Yes, exits, and sends it to the camera roll.",

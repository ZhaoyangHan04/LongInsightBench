    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the sub-events is:\n\n  1. Set a breakpoint at the start of main using the 'break' (b) command.\n  2. At the for loop, prints i = 1 and then finds factorial is a big negative number due to no initialization.\n  3. Sets a breakpoint after the do-while loop by specifying a line number with the file name, then continues.\n  4. After stepping through four iterations, prints factorial and sees a huge wrong value, so restarts.\n  5. Uses the print command to inspect variable values while stepping.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5.\n\nAnswer: D",

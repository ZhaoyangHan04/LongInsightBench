    "model_answer": "The correct order of events is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nOption B is the correct answer. The video begins with the title card appearing on screen from 0.00 to 0.76 seconds. The narrator then speaks about keyboard shortcuts starting at 0.84 seconds, so option B is the first event. After that, the narrator mentions using control four to toggle grid snap, which is followed by moving clips around in the DAW, so option B continues to be correct. Next, a \"Freeze\" dialog pops up as the narrator discusses freezing tracks, and finally, the EQ Eight opens and a narrow peak near 5.29 kHz is boosted as modes are mentioned. This completes the sequence of events, making option B the correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "The correct order of events is: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\nEvent 1 introduces the topic of the video and mentions the \"+ button\", which starts playing an ominous organ tone. Event 3 describes how parallel effect chains and chain selectors are introduced over a techno beat. Event 2 explains how Auto Pan parameters in Kontakt 4 are mapped to a master knob. Event 4 discusses how tracks can steal audio from other tracks through input dropdowns and grouping. Event 5 demonstrates a feature where a vocal sample sings while showing how grain delay works. Finally, Event 6 shows how the \"Extract Groove\" function in Ableton Live creates yellow groove markers when used on a track.\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the editing steps is:\n\n1. The speaker discusses transitions, demonstrates a slide, and speeds transitions to 0.5s while a transition appears between clips.\n2. He says it’s starting to look right, then tells you to hit Done and name the project to share, while a project title like \"Cape Town\" is shown.\n3. A green audio track for \"We Are One\" is added to the timeline and a short music snippet plays.\n4. A promo screen reads \"VIDEO FOR BEGINNERS ONLINE COURSE\" over footage (e.g., a skateboarder) as he plugs more tutorials.\n5. The Ken Burns effect is explained while the interface shows \"Ken Burns Enabled\" and \"Pinch to position the start.\"\n6. He notes a clip is still too long and keeps shortening clips to keep the video moving.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 4.",

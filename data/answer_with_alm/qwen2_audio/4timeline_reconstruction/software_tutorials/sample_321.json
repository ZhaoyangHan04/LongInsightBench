Next, they describe how the user should locate and open the shared.xml file in Notepad.\n3. Then, the speaker instructs the user on how to edit the file to disable UPNP.\n4. After the user saves and restarts Skype, the \"Unable to connect to Skype servers\" error message appears.\n5. At this point, the speaker reassures the user that the problem is likely due to the UPNP being disabled and that it should work after logging out and back in again.\n6. Finally, once the user logs back in and selects HTTPS with a non-zero port number, the speaker confirms that everything is working correctly.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6. Option A is the correct answer.",

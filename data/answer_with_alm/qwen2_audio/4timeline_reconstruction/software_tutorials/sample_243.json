    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is:\n\n1. The screen shows chord diagrams for Am, G, C, F as the speaker names them.\n2. The speaker counts out the verse rhythm (“one and …”) while demonstrating on guitar with an on-screen rhythmic guide.\n3. The speaker announces “pre-chorus” as F, G, Am, G chords are played on screen.\n4. He explains the pre-chorus strum (“on the one and the two… three and four and”) while demonstrating; the beat count “1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &” appears.\n5. He says “that’s all there is to it” before the guitar continues.\n6. The screen changes to a dark slide with “Chorus” lyrics displayed.\n7. The “Bridge” lyrics (“Needle and the thread…”) appear as he outlines another rhythm (“on the one, two and the end of three, then four and”) and demonstrates.\n8. He introduces the bridge palm-muting technique and demonstrates it with chord diagrams at the bottom.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 6 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8.",

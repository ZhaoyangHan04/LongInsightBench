This happens at time interval (3).\n\nNext, the speaker shows how to use the stylus to drag a widget from the picker and long-press to enlarge it on the phone. This occurs at time interval (1).\n\nAfterwards, the Play Store page for “Bubble Cloud Widgets…” appears while the speaker calls it a complete system with more features coming. This happens at time interval (2).\n\nThen, the editor pencil is tapped to edit a red-outlined bubble, and its size/color is adjusted. This occurs at time interval (5).\n\nFollowing this, the speaker discusses app drawer sensitivity and hotspot/double-tap on the smartwatch. The launcher for Android Wear screen appears during this discussion. This happens at time interval (4).\n\nFinally, the speaker advises using hollow bubbles in ambient mode to save battery and prevent burn-in. This occurs at time interval (6).\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is option C: 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6 -> 2.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option C: 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 6.\nFirstly, the speaker explains the live-info icons on the watch, including the calendar bubble showing the current date. This is followed by a phone ringing while the speaker mentions that it will stop when you pick it up using 'Find My Phone'. Then, the speaker describes the brightness controls on the phone with different ambient levels based on the background changing from sunset to night. Next, the Wear Cloud Editor on the phone is used to arrange bubbles and mention exporting/sharing themes, with the watch preview updating in real-time. After this, a green \"STICKY OPEN\" instruction bubble appears while the speaker explains how to pin an app on the watch. Finally, the watch shows a contact cloud, and the speaker suggests adding up to 15 contacts and setting default call/text/email settings.\nTherefore, the sequence is: explaining live-info icons on the watch, a phone ringing, describing brightness controls, using the Wear Cloud Editor, appearing a green \"STICKY OPEN\" instruction bubble, and showing a contact cloud.",

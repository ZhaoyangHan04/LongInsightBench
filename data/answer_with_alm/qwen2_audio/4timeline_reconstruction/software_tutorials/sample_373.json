Rachel, in a striped shirt, introduces herself and her role.\n  3. Patricia says there's a \"new video overview in analytics,\" and the screen shows a YouTube Studio page with \"This video is popular!\" (We hear this after seeing Rachel introduce herself, so it must come before she starts talking about the new video overview.)\n  4. An on-screen overlay reads \"#1 Views are up but CTR is down\" as CTR is called a tricky metric.\n  5. Rachel explains the CTR paradox and recommends checking CTR together with impressions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

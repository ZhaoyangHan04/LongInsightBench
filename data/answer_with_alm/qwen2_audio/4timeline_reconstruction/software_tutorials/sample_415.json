This is followed by an introduction to Synfig Studio, which has a steep learning curve but is cross-platform and comes with Creative Commons bone/skeleton examples.\n\nNext, the narrator pulls up the interface for Blender and shows how the character drinks from a bottle on the Blender timeline. He then explains how he made the animation in Inkscape and imported it into Blender, where the hand's movement was driven by bones.\n\nIn Open 2D Magic, a new project is created and a green landscape and a red car are added to the scene. The narrator then demonstrates how to use a rotation tween to keep the car static while the background scrolls and wheels rotate in a preview.\n\nFinally, GIMP is introduced as a Photoshop-like program that can be used to assemble frames into animations. The narrator saves the assembled animation as \"mosca.gif\" and loops it.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events is: (1) Listing of programs -> (2) Introduction to Synfig Studio -> (3) Displaying Blender interface and animation",

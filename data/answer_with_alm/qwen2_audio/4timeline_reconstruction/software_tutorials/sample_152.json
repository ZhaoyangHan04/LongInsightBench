Then, he contrasts with bar chords by playing a faster rock-style riff (4). After that, he explains the open chords to use and displays them on-screen (2). Next, he demonstrates the open-chord progression at original speed using E minor, D, and C (5). Finally, he confirms that all 16 strokes of the exercise were played (3).\n\nTherefore, the order of events is: Introduction of song versions -> Demonstration of faster riff -> Explanation of open chords -> Display of chord labels -> Confirmation of exercise completion.",

Event 3 involves explaining the importance of staying on one chord throughout the pattern and the need to switch chords to match the original. Event 4 provides a demonstration of how to form chords using acoustic guitar strings. Finally, in Event 5, the instructor invites comments and closes the lesson by saying \"see you once again.\"",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\nOption B best fits the sequence of events in the video. Firstly, there's a distinct sanding sound starting the video, which indicates the beginning. This is followed by upbeat electronic music playing throughout the duration of the video. Then, a comical shriek/echo is heard, and after that, we hear glass shattering. This event seems out of place in terms of chronology but could be linked to a humorous segment within the video. After these initial events, the text \"IDEAS MUST BE CONVEYED IN A Simple Yet Eye-Catching Manner\" appears on-screen, indicating a shift to a new segment where the speaker emphasizes clarity. The host then declares \"Let's go\" with a whooshing transition, possibly signaling the start of a new section or topic. On-screen text then reads \"TIP #3 Pick a Layout Type,\" introducing the third tip. Lastly, the crumpled paper background shows \"THE GRID\" with bullet points like \"EASIEST TO DO,\" and the speaker explains it further. This sequence aligns well with the options provided, making Option B the correct answer.",

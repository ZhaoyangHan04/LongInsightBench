This sets the context for the rest of the video.\n\nNext, a platform diagram appears on screen, highlighting \"JAKARTA EE WEB PROFILE.\" At this point, the speaker mentions that JPA (Java Persistence API) is included or added as a dependency in Jakarta EE Web Profile.\n\nUnderneath this, the speaker defines the concept of entity relationships using table diagrams. This provides a visual representation of how entities are related to each other in a relational database.\n\nAfter discussing entity relationships, the video moves on to explaining how to write queries using JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language). The speaker shows the use of SELECT, FROM, WHERE clauses on screen, and then describes their meaning.\n\nFinally, the presenter lists three query methods: JPQL, Criteria API, and named queries. These methods allow developers to execute various types of queries against a relational database.\n\nIn conclusion, the video concludes with a demonstration of performing updates and deletions using the merge() method. An abrupt sound effect interrupts this section before the final summary is provided",

This leads into a discussion about the Metamodel API, which appears on the screen after the Entity Manager actions are demonstrated. The Metamodel API provides metadata about the entities in the database.\n\nNext, the speaker mentions that metamodel classes are auto-generated with a trailing underscore, along with examples like \"UserID/UserName\". This likely refers to the process of generating Java classes based on the metadata provided by the Metamodel API.\n\nAfter this, the speaker begins talking about creating database records using entity classes. This involves performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database. The \"C.R.U.D.\" theme and \"Creating Database Records\" slides appear on the screen during this part of the presentation.\n\nThe next slide shows the \"SQL RESULT SET MAPPING\" slide, which appears when the speaker discusses mapping query results to Java objects. This involves specifying how to map the data returned by the database to the corresponding Java fields.\n\nFinally, the video ends",

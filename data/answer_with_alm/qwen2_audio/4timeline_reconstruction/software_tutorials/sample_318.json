    "model_answer": "The answer is C: 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5\nThe video starts with an introduction that says 'software doesn't matter,' which comes before any visual elements. This is followed by an upbeat jingle and the appearance of an owl logo. Next, we see a rotating polyhedron being rendered, which indicates the use of ray tracing technology. After this demonstration, there is a loud crash sound, which could be linked to the high computational requirements of rendering techniques like ray tracing. Finally, the speaker mentions how the look of 3D scenes has changed over time, specifically referencing the flat look that was prevalent in the past.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2\nOption A is incorrect because the apple scene happens before the discussion about rays per pixel and bounces.\nOption B is incorrect because the discussion about Octane 4 comes after the apple scene.\nOption C is incorrect because the order of the on-screen text and the Octane 4 promotion does not match the timeline.\nOption D is the correct answer because the apple scene comes first, followed by the on-screen text explaining rays per pixel and bounces, then the discussion about Octane 4, and finally the real-time ray tracing demo footage.",

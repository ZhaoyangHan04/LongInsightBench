    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events in the video is:\n\n  1. The \"CONCLUSION/TIPS\" slide appears with points like \"FILM A 'CLEAN PLATE'\" and the speaker gives an \"espresso of tips.\"\n  2. The speaker asks viewers to subscribe and mentions aiming for 100,000 subscribers, with a subscribe button on screen.\n  3. He introduces the Shure SM7B and notes it can block the mouth because you need to be close.\n  4. He switches to an AT2020 microphone and describes its sound as fat on the low end and crisp on the high end.\n  5. Slides present alternative mics (AKG C214, WA-87, Slate ML-1).\n  6. He explains a clean plate and masking technique, with on-screen text \"WHAT ABOUT ACOUSTIC TREATMENT?\"\n  7. He invites respectful feedback and then mellow instrumental music plays.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 7.",

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is B: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\nFirstly, in option B, the video starts with the speaker discussing the Andertons page, which leads into him mentioning the SM7DB's built-in active circuit and value. This event happens at the beginning of the video, so it should be listed first.\nNext, the speaker mentions that the video isn't sponsored and explains Patreon funding, which comes after the discussion about the Andertons page. This event occurs at approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds into the video.\nOption C is incorrect because the discussion about the AT2020 mic comes before the mention of the AT4033A.\nOption D is incorrect because the discussion about the SM7B comes before the mention of the AKG C214, WA-87, and Slate ML-1.\nTherefore, the correct sequence is B: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

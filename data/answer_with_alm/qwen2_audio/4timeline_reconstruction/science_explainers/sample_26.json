    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the sub-events is option D: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5. \n\nFirstly, the narrator mentions Earth's moon and abundant acid while the alien points at the planet and its moon (sub-event 1). This is followed by the lecturer categorizing life into plants, animals, Earthlings, and microbes as these appear on/around the planet (sub-event 2). Then, a DNA double helix is highlighted while narration explains the genetic code and life’s priorities (sub-event 3). After this, a large brain is shown as the narrator explains society and the mind’s three parts; the segment ends with a swoosh sound (sub-event 4). Finally, a robotic voice gives “scientific advice” to use electric shocks to study brain function as a syringe injects into a brain (sub-event 5).\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of events is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

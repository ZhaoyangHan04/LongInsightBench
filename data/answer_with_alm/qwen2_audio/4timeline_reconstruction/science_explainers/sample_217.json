This is then connected to a scientific article that supports the idea that sodium bicarbonate can improve performance during intense exercise. Finally, the host addresses the issue of individual variability and the lack of significant additional benefits when combining caffeine with sodium bicarbonate.",

He then mentions that he has been sponsored by a company called Amp Human to promote their product, which is a topical lotion that contains sodium bicarbonate. The host shows a page on their website where the product is sold for $55 with four and a half-star reviews.\nNext, the host applies a yellow patch of lotion to his arm and explains that a study conducted by the University of Texas Medical Branch found that using the lotion did not improve cycling performance. The host also criticizes a misleading graph in the study that showed a significant improvement in performance.\nThe host then presents another study that claims a 53% reduction in muscle soreness and a shorter recovery time when using the lotion. However, the host notes that this study was funded by Amp Human, and therefore may be biased. He also mentions that there is limited scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of topical sodium bicarbonate for athletic performance.\nFinally, the host shows an interval test called “SOURCE ENDURANCE” and says that it is not peer-reviewed or industry-influenced. He concludes",

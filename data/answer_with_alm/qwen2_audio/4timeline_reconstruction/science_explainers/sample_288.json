This is followed by the electromagnetic spectrum graphic highlighting 532 nm (green) and 1064 nm (near-infrared), which reflect strongly off vegetation, as mentioned in option 2.\nNext, the speaker mentions that the IMU panel tracks the plane's tilt, which is related to the movement of the aircraft, and this occurs before the discussion about GPS satellites and their use for tracking position, as described in option 3.\nFinally, the presentation ends with a mention of free data being made available through NEON, which is related to the use of airborne lidar data, as described in option 5.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n  1. The speaker starts by explaining the concept of LiDAR and how it uses lasers to measure elevation. This is indicated by the mention of the term \"NADIR\" and \"OFF-NADIR.\"\n  2. Next, a caution sign with the words \"LiDAR JARGON AHEAD\" appears on the screen, which suggests that the speaker is about to introduce some technical jargon related to LiDAR.\n  3. In response to this, the speaker defines the terms \"pulse\" and \"return,\" and notes that simply knowing these terms does not provide the full picture of how LiDAR works.\n  4. As part of this explanation, a diagram of yaw, pitch, and roll appears on the screen. This indicates that the speaker is discussing the orientation of the LiDAR system.\n  5. Following this, the speaker writes the equation \"(travel time) * (speed of light) / 2\" on a blackboard. This equation is used to convert the time taken for the laser pulse to travel back to the LiDAR receiver into a distance measurement.\n  6. Finally, the speaker uses this equation and a GPS altitude reading to calculate",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is: \n1. The speaker contrasts melting in West Antarctica with record cold in the East and asks the cause as Antarctica maps and graphs appear. This sets up the context for the discussion of climate change in Antarctica.\n2. A journal article on Thwaites Glacier geothermal heat is shown while the speaker describes thin crust blocks and heat release. This provides background information on the geology of Antarctica.\n3. A volcano map with red dots is shown as the narrator cites helium isotope evidence of active volcanism under Pine Island Glacier. This introduces the topic of volcanic activity in Antarctica.\n4. Cross-sectional heat-flux visuals of Antarctica appear while the speaker claims a large mantle plume under West Antarctica causes intense warming. This discusses the potential causes of melting in Antarctica.\n5. A thermometer embedded in ice reads −28°C as the calm voice asks why subglacial lakes don’t freeze. This addresses the physical conditions of Antarctica and the challenges of studying it.\n6. An animation of Earth’s molten interior plays while the speaker says magma is rising closer to the surface and abnormal core processes are occurring. This concludes the discussion by highlighting the complex geological processes that are happening beneath Antarctica.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: ",

A quote from Professor Karen Heywood about geothermal heat from the West Antarctic rift is heard over footage of an Antarctic eruption. (Option A)\n2. NASA-branded visuals and a heat-flux cross-section accompany the claim of a large mantle plume under West Antarctica. (Option A)\n3. A National Geographic webpage on Greenland’s melt appears while the narrator says “600 billion tons” lost. (Option C)\n4. A thermometer in ice displays −28°C as the narrator asks “Why?” subglacial lakes don't freeze. (Option D)\n5. Research teams and diagrams about Greenland are shown as the speaker mentions a mantle plume and thinner crust in the north. (Option B)\n6. Heat-flux maps near Iceland and Greenland appear as the speaker says findings were confirmed by machine learning. (Option A)\n7. Twin web pages on geothermal heat flux are shown before an Earth interior animation as the speaker says magma is rising and core processes are abnormal. (Option B)\n8. A warning about 12,000-year cycles and a call to unite the scientific community are heard over “Global Crisis: Time for the Truth” conference graphics.",

This occurs at the beginning of the video.\nNext, there is a \"Subscribe\" prompt with a thumbs-up icon as the speaker encourages viewers to subscribe or like. This happens after the mention of 2012.\nThen, there is close-up footage of the Sun as a gas giant and how Earth's magnetic field creates auroras. This occurs after the \"Subscribe\" prompt.\nFinally, the speaker takes the audience back to 1859 to the first recorded solar storm, complete with aurora visuals. This is followed by the narrator in a control room monitoring solar activity, stating that he has found no credible source for a 2025 'internet apocalypse' and treating it as a rumor.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nOption A best fits the sequence of events described in the audio. The ominous rumbling sets the stage for the impending warnings about power and internet outages. The following footage from NASA Goddard provides context on the scientific research that led to these warnings. As the narrator acknowledges uncertainty about the solar storm, a dim scene may reflect on the unknown consequences of such an event. Subsequently, the discussion about workers at an electrical site ties into the practical implications of a potential global power outage. Finally, the mention of an asteroid collision directs viewers to another video, concluding the sequence.",

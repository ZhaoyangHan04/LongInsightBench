Then, a male narrator explains the concept of wave-particle duality (option 4). This leads into a discussion about the mind being the center of reality (option 2), which is connected to the concept of emptiness in Buddhism (option 3).\n\nFinally, the video returns to the topic of quantum physics with a joke about atoms being mostly made up of space (option 5). This completes the sequence of events.",

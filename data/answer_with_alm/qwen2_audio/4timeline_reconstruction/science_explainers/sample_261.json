Then, the right-ear segment ends with the word \"nervousness\" spoken (4). Next, the speaker asks whether nervousness around someone you like could be a good thing (2). After that, the speaker explains that nervous reactions can signal romantic interest and trigger reciprocity (6). This is followed by a friendly sign-off to like, share, subscribe, and turn on notifications (7). Finally, the correct order ends with the speaker suggesting asking someone out to see \"It Chapter 2\" or \"Spider-Man\" and giving a tip to speak into their right ear (1).",

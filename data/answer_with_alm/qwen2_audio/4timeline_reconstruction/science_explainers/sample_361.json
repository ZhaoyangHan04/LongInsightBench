Then, the host introduces a news story about a man claiming a cold fusion machine, and asks what the guest knows about cold fusion. This leads into the bearded guest's introduction on a single-camera view in his office with the da Vinci poster. He recalls watching Pons and Fleischmann evade questions alongside Carl Sagan.\nNext, the guest quotes his quip to reporters, \"cold, not fusion,\" which made Carl chuckle. This event is followed by a discussion of a demonstration at the University of Bologna, where witnesses lacked access to the machine's innards. Finally, the JREF logo and the \"randi.org\" screen appear with a voiceover crediting the foundation.",

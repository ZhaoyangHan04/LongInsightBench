    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \n1. A vintage Radio Shack TRS-80 pocket computer ad is shown while the speaker transitions into discussing Isaac Asimov and praises his writing.\n2. The screen shows “What if Earth was flat?” with Earth and ships at the edge as the narrator paraphrases that ancients were nearly right because measured curvature was near zero.\n3. A curvature comparison graphic (flat, sphere, oblate spheroid) is on screen while the narrator explains Earth is slightly flattened at the poles.\n4. The Vanguard I satellite diagram appears as the narrator names “1958 Vanguard 1” and describes measuring Earth’s shape.\n5. A man with white hair and glasses stands beside text as the speaker says theories refine and extend rather than being entirely wrong.\n6. A black-and-white quote about tiny but non-zero rates of change appears while the narrator links this to modern geology and evolution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

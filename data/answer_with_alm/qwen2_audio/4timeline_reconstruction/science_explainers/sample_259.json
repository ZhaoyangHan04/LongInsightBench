First, the narrator welcome viewers to a vodcast on Earthâ€™s rotation and revolution as space-view titles appear, so the sequence starts with option 1. Then the speaker defines rotation and notes the tilted axis, so the next step is option 2. After that, the speaker mentions how long a day is, so option 3 comes next.

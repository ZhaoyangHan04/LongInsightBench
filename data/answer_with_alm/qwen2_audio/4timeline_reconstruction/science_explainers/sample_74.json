    "model_answer": "The correct timeline of the events is: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\n\nThe first event is the ringing of the vintage rotary phone, which is shown in the beginning of the scene along with title text. This is followed by the buzzing tone from the comb-and-paper diaphragm as the boy experiments near the window.\n\nNext, we see close-ups of a bearded man and apparatus, which likely correspond to the narration about Bell's 1874 idea. This is followed by a labeled diagram of a carbon granule microphone, which shows its parts being explained.\n\nFinally, we have two boys holding receivers while the narrator mentions that nothing has been said about how telephones are connected. This is followed by a battery marked BATTERY being wired to the phone, as the narrator explains that a series connection is wasteful.\n\nTherefore, the order of the events is: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6",

    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5. \n\nThe first event is the narrator describing the gauge labeled SPEECH CURRENT and distinguishing steady current from the fluctuating “speech current”. This happens early in the film, likely before the scene where boys wire a device labeled TRANSFORMER. \n\nThe second event is the boys wiring the transformer, which involves passing fluctuating current and stepping up voltage. This occurs after the narrator's description of the speech current gauge. \n\nThe third event is the appearance of a diagram labeled TELEPHONE EXCHANGE, which leads to the narrator explaining that bells must ring from the exchange even with hooks open. This event comes after the transformer wiring scene. \n\nThe fourth event is switchboard operators connecting a call, which is accompanied by a brief dialogue between Eric and Joe. This occurs after the explanation of the telephone exchange. \n\nFinally, the credits appear while a loud, increasing buzzing sound is heard. This marks the end of the film.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option D: 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1.\nFirstly, we see Isaac Newton's portrait and text about his first law being displayed, along with a mocking voice questioning what he knows. This is followed by an animation showing Earth from space, which leads into a discussion about the Earth's rotation and the experiment of a helicopter taking off from a moving truck.\nNext, we see an elderly man with a beard sitting in a cozy living room, with on-screen text stating that he is a nominee for something called the Golden Crocoduck. He then makes a statement about the Earth standing still.\nFinally, we see a man jumping off a moving train into the desert, warning that he may have injured his collarbone and not recommending the activity. This marks the end of the video.",

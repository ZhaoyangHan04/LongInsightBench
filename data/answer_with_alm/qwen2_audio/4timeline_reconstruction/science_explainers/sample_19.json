    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n1. The host, wearing the Sci Man Dan shirt, corrects a rocket-candy detail and announces today's focus.\n2. A close-up of an \"FTFE\" ring appears while heavy metal plays, ending with a toilet flush.\n3. A classroom scene: the teacher shushes children and a student says Darroid is being mean.\n4. A blackboard shows \"Distance to the Horizon\" with D=3.57/r leading to a distance result as pencil scratching is heard.\n5. Two male speakers argue heatedly about Earth, followed by a sarcastic remark about needing physical evidence.\n6. The host signs off asking to like/subscribe and thanking Patrons; an electronic outro repeats \"Fight the Flat Earth\" with an \"I didn't!\" interjection.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: (1) Opening line: the host says he's \"fighting fire with fire\" while standing before the Earth-patterned backdrop. (2) Channel intro promises to \"replace stupidity's IV with embalming fluid,\" mentions flurfs and The Creeky Blinders. (3) Overlaid social-media comments are read aloud; a dry voice jokes about \"crackhead\" being an entire comment. (4) The host says a comment deserves the remedial classroom, cutting to a classroom with children chatting. (5) A blackboard shows gravity and buoyancy formulas as an explanation covers oceans vs. balloons; a brief horn interrupts. (6) The speaker jokes about \"theatrical physics,\" notes images made with different sensors (\"not rocket surgery\"), tells Steve to stop, then asks viewers to like/subscribe.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6.",

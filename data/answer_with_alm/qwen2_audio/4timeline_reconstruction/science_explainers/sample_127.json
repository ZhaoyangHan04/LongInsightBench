    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n  1. The red title “SCIENTIFICALLY SPEAKING” with “Forbidden Science” appears over a winding road as melancholic ambient music plays and a male greets the audience to discuss a technology topic.\n  2. A male voice claims a small occult elite shapes history and invites viewers to subscribe while the twilight road scene continues.\n  3. A split-screen shows a road and a construction site with on-screen text about a tree trunk being 20 million years old, while the speaker questions dating methods.\n  4. A black screen shows a yellow number “2” and a Telegram URL as instrumental music bridges segments.\n  5. A collage of one-wheeled vehicles is shown while the speaker says such machines had already existed.\n  6. Images of ancient stone carvings appear as the speaker mentions Puma Punku and a special metal fastener used to fasten huge stones.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\nFirstly, we have an illustration of dead soldiers on a bridge which leads us to think about war and conflict. This might be followed by a discussion about the impact of wars on societies, which could lead to the mention of the French army under Napoleon Bonaparte. Therefore, option C seems like a possible sequence.\nNext, we see a large yellow number \"5\" with a Telegram URL appearing over the road scene. This could suggest a modern context or reference to current events. This might be followed by a change in scene or topic, leading us to the next event.\nWe then move on to a black-and-white image of fossilized brains with arrows, which could be related to science or history. This might be accompanied by a discussion about evolution, as the化石显示的时间跨度 of millions of years could be seen as a contradiction to the theory of evolution. Therefore, option B seems like a possible sequence.\nAfter this, we see a photo of the Giants' Plain walls in Tibet with a rider, which could be related to geography or history. This might be followed by a discussion about historical expeditions and their findings, leading us to the next event",

This is followed by the sound of a woman picking up a chip and eating it in a kitchen, which can be heard between 1.57 and 2.25.\n\nAt 2.08, there is a brief explosive sound effect that marks the collaboration intro. This is shortly followed by the appearance of a Fast & Furious 9 poster and a joke about the quality of the upcoming movies. This happens between 2.08 and 2.56.\n\nNext, we have a playful, wind-like sound effect that occurs just before the narrator reveals coronal mass ejections. This sound effect can be heard between 3.29 and 3.72.\n\nAt 3.77, the narrator begins talking about the solar system, and the video shows the solar system on screen. This event takes place between 3.77 and 4.54.\n\nThe bold title \"Carrington Event",

Then, the narrator moves on to describe Olympus Mons, which is relevant to the topic but comes before discussing Mars and other celestial bodies in the solar system.\nNext, the narrator shows a visual of M87's black hole, which is accompanied by music and referred to humorously as 'the Chad.' This event is followed by an explanation about gamma-ray bursts and their origin.\nAfter this scientific discussion, the narration shifts to a philosophical topic with Istvan Horvath's quote about the cosmological principle. This is presented alongside a matter-distribution map and a handwritten question, creating a contrasting section within the video.\nFinally, the video concludes with the host signing off and showing the YouTube subscribe screen with a bell icon.",

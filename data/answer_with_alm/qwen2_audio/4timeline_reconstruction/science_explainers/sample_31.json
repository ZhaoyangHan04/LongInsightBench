The speaker starts by talking about an object from another star system visiting us, which sets the context for the discussion.\n  2. The diagram showing the expected and observed trajectory of the object is then presented, which provides additional information about its motion.\n  3. The ominous music adds tension and emphasizes the significance of the object's arrival.\n  4. The on-screen date \"2016.90\" appears, which references the time when the object was first observed and crossed the stars.\n  5. The Spitzer Space Telescope's findings are discussed, which ruled out the possibility of the object being a comet.\n  6. Finally, the speaker argues against the idea that the object could be an alien light sail, based on its tumbling motion and slow speed.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option C: 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 6.",

The speaker starts by saying something that implies an unexpected event occurred (\"This shouldn't have happened\"), which sets the tone for the rest of the video. This event is not clearly described in the provided options, so we cannot select an answer based on it.\n2. Next, the NASA-branded asteroid animation plays, which might be related to the discussion about the object that was observed. This event is also not clearly described in the provided options, so we cannot select an answer based on it.\n3. A split-screen of two moons/planets appears, which seems to be connected to the discussion about brightness variability. This event is mentioned in option C, so it is the correct answer.\n4. A large asteroid emits a plume in space, which might be related to the discussion about the nature of the object that was observed. This event is mentioned in option D, so it is the correct answer.\n5. Speculation about interstellar war and shipwrecks follows, which might be related to the discussion about the object that was observed.

Then, after some time, event 5 takes place, where gold \"Au\" is highlighted with the labels \"GOLD\" and \"AURUS.\" This is followed by event 1, where a graphic showing \"118 ELEMENTS\" appears along with other visual aids. \n\nEvent 3 then occurs, where a blue triangle labeled \"NITROGEN\" appears as ambient liquid sounds play in the background. After this, event 4 takes place, where a blue circle labeled \"CORE\" with separate \"PROTONS+\" and \"NEUTRONS\" visuals appears. Finally, event 6 happens, where a phone briefly rings while the speaker lists essential elements alongside visuals of the human body's composition.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 6 -> 3 -> 4.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option B: 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\nThe audio starts with a graphic of a cloud of electrons, which is followed by a description of electron orbits. This is likely related to the topic of the periodic table, which comes next. The periodic table is shown filling up element-by-element, which is followed by a description of lithium and neon. This is followed by a comparison of lithium and sodium electron configurations using xylophone-like chimes. Finally, the audio ends with electronic music and credits. Therefore, the events in the audio follow the order of 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

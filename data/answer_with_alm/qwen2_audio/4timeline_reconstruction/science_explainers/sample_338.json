    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\nExplanation:\nThe video starts with upbeat electronic music playing as the man greets and introduces the experiment. This indicates that event 1 occurred first. Then, he warns about the danger of the experiment and mentions dead-shorting a battery, which suggests that event 2 happened next. After this, we hear the sound of a drill, indicating that event 3 took place. The loud crackling spark and the man pulling the wire off suggest that event 4 occurred. Next, the man uses a Gauss meter and moves it near the object, which indicates that event 5 happened. Finally, the video ends with the man inviting theories on his forums as electronic music fades out, suggesting that event 6 occurred last. Therefore, the correct sequence is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct order of events is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\n\nExplanation:\nEvent 1: The first event involves the person listing necessary materials and making a noise by working on a desk. This sets the stage for the experimental setup.\nEvent 2: In event 2, the person mentions drilling a hole and lining metal nuts around it. This indicates that the next step involved assembling or constructing something.\nEvent 3: After mentioning magnetically connected nuts, the person uses a Gauss meter to test them. This suggests that the previous steps were related to building or testing a device involving magnets.\nEvent 4: In event 4, the person challenges others to explain the concept of their experiment. This implies that the experiment has been completed and is ready for discussion or demonstration.\nEvent 5: The final event involves the person explaining the behavior of a probe and encountering unexpected results. This indicates that the experiment was successful and led to some surprising discoveries.\nEvent 6: Lastly, the person comments on the strength of glue used to hold components together, which seems to be unrelated to the main experiment but provides additional context.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4",

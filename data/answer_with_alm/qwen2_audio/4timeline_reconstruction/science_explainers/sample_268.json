This is followed by a black screen with a list of words, as mentioned in the question. Then, the blue sky title card appears, asking why antidepressants take so long to work, as the narrator mentions the 6-8 week warning. After this, we see the title \"Negative affective bias\" appear, along with a painting, as the narrator contrasts bright social details with noticing an isolated girl. Next, there are scenic nature/city visuals as the narrator introduces a theory that depressed people process information differently. Finally, the pills reappear with text about decreasing negative affective biases, while the narrator explains immediate changes in emotional processing (e.g., remembering more positive words).",

First, there is a mention of a vial labeled “Ketamine”. Then, a close-up of a wristwatch appears. Afterward, the static red end card with the brain-in-a-lightbulb appears. Next, a 3D brain with a highlighted region is shown",

    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is: (1) The speaker introduces “ten rules,” criticizing symbol-focused teaching and stressing relationships. (2) A white title card shows “1” with the text “MATH CAN’T BE TAught.” (3) The speaker says “math can’t be taught,” adding that children learn by doing with real objects. (4) The text “It Happens in the Head” appears with a brain character as the speaker analogizes to music and says math happens in people’s heads. (5) A boy plays the piano, then the scene transitions to the title “Math Needs Years of Practice.” (6) The speaker emphasizes years of practice and mental arithmetic using the example of understanding the number eight.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is: B: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\nOption B best fits the sequence of events described in the audio. First, a girl uses scissors to cut a framed picture of blue and orange animal faces into two parts (event 2). Then, the speaker explains that most five-year-olds cannot keep the whole in mind after cutting it into parts (event 1). Next, the speaker states that by age seven, most children can comprehend the whole and also divide it into parts (event 3). Afterward, under the heading “EXPERIENCES PRECEDE LANGUAGE,” a child writes the word “Eight” on paper (event 4). Finally, the speaker says math can be expressed in different languages, moving from objects/images to numerals (and possibly bits) (event 5), and asserts most people have language, not math, problems, citing “street mathematics” (event 6).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the sub-events is option D: 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3.\nThe first event is when the screen asks the question \"How do we contain Antimatter?\" and displays a humorous image (option D). This is followed by the equation E=mcÂ² with annotations (option B), which explains the relationship between energy and mass. Then, there is a grid of X's representing a magnetic field with charges (option C), which is used to trap charged particles. A loud thunder strike then interrupts the discussion (option A), and an animated atom is shown on screen (option E).\nFinally, the speaker talks about positrons produced by radioactive decay and cosmic rays, and the words \"Radioactive Decay\" and \"Cosmic Rays\" appear on the screen (option E).",

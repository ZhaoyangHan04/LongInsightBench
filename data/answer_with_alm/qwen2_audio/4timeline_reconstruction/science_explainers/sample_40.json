    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n- The narrator starts by talking about probability thought experiments, which might suggest that he's preparing the audience for some mathematical concepts. This could be followed by the visual of multiple rockets launching into the night sky, which could symbolize the exploration of unknowns and the pursuit of knowledge.\n- Next, the narrator mentions red apples labeled \"3 apples\" and \"4 apples,\" which could be part of a demonstration or an example used to illustrate a concept related to counting or probability.\n- Then, the scene cuts to a man in a suit standing before a chalkboard full of equations, which suggests that the narrator is discussing mathematical or scientific concepts.\n- After this, the narrator shows a classroom puzzle involving three doors and a goat, which is often used to introduce the concept of conditional probability and the Monty Hall problem.\n- Finally, the narrator shows swirling pink-purple nebulae, which could be used to illustrate the vastness and complexity of the universe and our limited understanding of it.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is option C: 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is option D: 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5 -> 1.\nThe sequence starts with the narrator showing black-and-white photos of Max Planck and Albert Einstein, which is likely to grab the audience's attention and set the stage for a discussion about science and common sense. The narrator then quotes Einstein about common sense and empirical evidence, which leads into the next part of the presentation.\nNext, the narrator shows illustrations of evolutionary transitions, which provides visual support for the concept of evolution. This is followed by a poster of \"Mickey Mouse examples of 'evolution'\" and a blindfolded man, which may be used to illustrate the idea that some people have a misunderstanding of evolution.\nFinally, the narrator talks about ideas being replaced over time and why some non-scientists distrust evolution, which leads to the topic of common sense and its role in science. The presentation ends with the narrator saying \"Thanks for watching,\" which signals the end of the video.",

Then, a map of the Soviet Union appears, possibly related to Lysenko's rejection of genes. Next, the narrator quotes Lysenko about Darwinism, which leads into a discussion of genetics and genetic mapping. This is followed by on-screen text contrasting winter vs spring wheat, which relates to jarovization and vernalization. Finally, two black-and-white photos appear with \"Lysenko\" labeled over them, likely to introduce him further.",

Then, there is a newspaper headline mentioning a Soviet famine, followed by the narrator warning about state-backed pseudoscience and the importance of scientific freedom. This suggests that events 2 and 3 occurred next.\nScientists working in a lab coat then appear on screen, which indicates that event 4 happened. Finally, Andrei Sakharov's portrait and his criticism of Lysenko supporters are shown, followed by the man holding a piece of bread and appealing to Soviet leaders. This suggests that events 5 and 6 occurred last.\nTherefore, the correct order of events is 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3.",

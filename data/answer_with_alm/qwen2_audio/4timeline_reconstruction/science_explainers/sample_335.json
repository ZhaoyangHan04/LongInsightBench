    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: (1) The on-screen title \"THE BONE-HEART Connection THE ROLE OF VITAMIN K2\" appears as the speaker introduces himself as Sanjay Gupta. (2) Wearing a hoodie with an orange cat and Japanese characters, he first brings up vitamin K and K2, with faint static in the audio. (3) He gives a thumbs-up while explaining Vitamin K2 and Vitamin D activate matrix GLA proteins to clear calcium from tissues. (4) He cites the Rotterdam study, saying K2-rich diets halve arterial calcification and reduce cardiovascular deaths. (5) In a warm orange-lit shot, he says he's been impressed by K2, started supplementing, and added fermented foods. (6) With a ceiling light visible, he cautions that research links calcium supplements to higher coronary risk. Therefore, the correct order is option A: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is:\n\n1. He raises his right hand showing a ring while contrasting osteoporosis (low bone calcium) with coronary calcification (excess calcium).\n2. He reads from a meta-analysis, stating 700â€“1,000 mg dietary or 1,000 mg supplemental calcium can increase coronary artery disease risk.\n3. Wearing a black beanie, he explains Vitamin K2 activates osteocalcin to move calcium into bone.\n4. Under warmer orange lighting, he references a 2008 Journal of Vascular Research finding about inactive (not K2-activated) matrix GLA protein correlating with vascular calcification and asks if increasing K2 could help.\n5. He contrasts Vitamin K1 for clotting with K2 from animal products and fermented foods like natto, noting natto has the most K2.\n6. He closes by thanking viewers, followed by music.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6.",

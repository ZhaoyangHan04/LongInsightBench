Then, the speaker mentions that the relevant information for their purpose is on the third page, which is followed by a discussion about the curvature of the Earth. Next, the speaker refers to a space view of Earth and overlayed text, explaining the spherical trigonometry behind it. Afterward, the speaker shows animated scenes related to the curvature of the Earth, including a boat, telescope, and lighthouse. Finally, the black-and-white curvature diagram follows, and the speaker provides more detailed calculations.",

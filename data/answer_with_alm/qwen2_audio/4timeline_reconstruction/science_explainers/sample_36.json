    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n  1. Pluto is not a planet; shut up, a stern male voice says (immediate reaction to the news)\n  2. The host introduces his show as a planet image appears and retro electronic music begins (start of the show)\n  3. A black screen shows the IAU 2006 planet definition while the host calls the vote “weird” (introduction to the topic of Pluto's reclassification)\n  4. A TRAPPIST-1 system graphic with yellow text “... not planets apparently.” appears as the host critiques excluding exoplanets (a side note on the broader discussion of planetary classification)\n  5. At a podium, a speaker declares the IAU made a “tragic mistake,” applause follows, and another voice excitedly repeats “planet again” (the official announcement of Pluto's reclassification as a dwarf planet)\n  6. Back in the kitchen, the host says to reply that Pluto “is a planet” and that “this is far from over” (a final statement on the topic)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

Slides of the largest dwarf planets and then a “MOONS OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM” poster appear while he notes Google Scholar hits mostly show “M dwarf stars,” with a quirky synth tune.\n  3. A simple black graphic with two white dots appears as he explains the Pluto-Charon barycenter and a hypothetical Jupiter-sized pair.\n  4. A caveman-and-bear illustration with reclassification text appears while he tells a caveman analogy; somber strings play briefly afterward.\n  5. A black background states the dwarf planet definition is not linked to size as he says “planetary dwarfism has nothing to do with size,” implying Pluto was targeted.\n  6. A black screen defines a geophysical planet; then Pluto and a Great Dane vs Chihuahua comparison appear as voices argue for classifying by intrinsic attributes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6.",

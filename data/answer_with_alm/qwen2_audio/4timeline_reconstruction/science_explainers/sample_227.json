The video starts with a title screen showing \"NickMach007\" and \"The Planted Tank,\" which indicates that event 1 occurred first. Then, a cowbell rings, and the words \"GLUTARALDEHYDE\" appear on the screen, suggesting that event 3 happened next. After that, the speaker discusses safety differences between formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde, which corresponds to event 4. Event 2 occurs when the speaker introduces the mini-series by saying this episode covers what liquid carbon is. Finally, the video ends with a black-and-white end card that includes social media prompts and instrumental music, which corresponds to event 6. Option C also seems possible but does not fit the sequence of events as closely as option A. Option D has some elements in the right order but is not a perfect match.",

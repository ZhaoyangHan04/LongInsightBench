Then, he strikes the wooden bat, which rings audibly, and then moves toward the whiteboard (Option 2). At the whiteboard, he explains the charge circuit, likening capacitor charging to swinging back a baseball bat (Option 3). Next, he describes the spark gap and big primary coil, saying it’s like hitting it with the bat (Option 4). Afterward, he calls the high-voltage side the electrical equivalent of the heavy bag and talks about pumping an impulse into the secondary while a “DANGER HIGHVOLTAGE” sign is visible (Option 5). Finally, he mentions planning a “dancing goop” mechanical resonance video while pointing to a drawing of the blue punching bag on the board (Option 6).",

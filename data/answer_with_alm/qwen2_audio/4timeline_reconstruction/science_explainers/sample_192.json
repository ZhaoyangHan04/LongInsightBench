    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on climate change for help. The sequence should start with a discussion on scientific findings, leading to a mention of a specific article published in 1976. This should be followed by a prediction about the future, which is then juxtaposed with a claim about the past. The next segment should show a contrast between two opinions, after which there should be a transition to a discussion about media representations of climate science. Finally, the last segment should reference a well-known source that supports the argument being made in the preceding sections.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

Then, a male voice disputes this consensus and mentions climate change. This leads to a discussion about climate change and its predictions. One of the speakers then quotes from a Time magazine article about climatologists predicting an ice age. Another speaker mentions that this consensus is a myth and cites a George Will column from 2008. Finally, the video ends with a slide showing the full quote from the National Science Board, which mentions that we are heading into a new ice age in 20,000 years.",

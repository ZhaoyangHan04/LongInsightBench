The title “Clip 2: ERVs” appears over chromosome imagery as a calm voice says up to 10% of the genome are failed retroviruses.\n2. A slide titled “Lineage-Specific Expansions…” is followed by an APOBEC3 pathway figure while the speaker discusses APOBEC3 and says chimps lack this gene, implying different defenses.\n3. A PTERV1 phylogeny diagram is shown, then affectionate chimps; one speaker frames it as common design, and another rebuttal voice calls that hilarious and describes infection history and distribution.\n4. The yellow caption “Stoned?” appears beside a headphones-wearing speaker while the audio calls someone an uneducated buffoon and promises to present three clips.\n5. A red “F”-graded paper and retrotransposon graphics are shown while the audio says the person would fail a molecular biology class, explains transposable elements/ERVs, then says he’ll move on.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option D: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "The events seem to be out of chronological order based on the provided details. However, I will try my best to reconstruct them based on the available information:\n\nFirstly, there seems to be an overlap between option A (1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6) and option C (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6). Both options suggest that the events start with a FOX 10 Phoenix headline about the first Neuralink patient, followed by a demonstration of the technology in action.\n\nBased on the available information, it seems that option C may be the correct order, as it starts with the same event and adds additional context to the sequence. Therefore, the reconstructed timeline could be:\n\n1. FOX 10 Phoenix headline about the first Neuralink patient appears while the narrator calls the demo both \"coolest\" and \"horrifying\".\n2. A wheelchair user in front of a blue curtain is on screen as the speaker says Nolan can now play Civilization 6 and Mario Kart.\n3. Split-screen Mario Kart gameplay is shown while the speaker discusses faster, more precise movements and user adaptation.\n4. A robotic arm with exposed wiring is shown as the speaker says the tech is nearly ready",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is: \n1. The man in an \"INVICTUS\" shirt in a wheelchair says it felt like using the force. (Event 1)\n2. Multi-monitor coding shots appear while the speaker jokes that brain hacking could boost Vim/Emacs productivity. (Event 2)\n3. airplane business-class laptop scenes play as the speaker explains using a Neuralink-driven KVM to control different machines. (Event 3)\n4. A Yahoo Finance graphic is onscreen while the speaker warns that a brain-embedded proprietary computer could control your thoughts. (Event 4)\n5. Shots of a brain in a sphere and a prosthetic leg on a treadmill appear as the speaker calls for two-way feedback like weight/pressure from robotic arms. (Event 5)\n6. An online store page with a light blue \"COME AND FIND IT\" t-shirt appears as the speaker promotes his merch and advises avoiding brain chips unless necessary. (Event 6)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5.",

This is followed by the speaker linking cicadas to the eclipse and highlighting places like Giant City State Park. Then, there is a group standing in front of military vehicles as the caption “AND IT'S BEEN ON THE MIND OF EVEN THE STATES” appears.\nNext, a starry sky appears with the text “THAT CANNOT JUST BE DISCOUNTED”. The on-screen text then changes to “THAT IT'S ALL NOT LOST” while the tone turns hopeful. After that, there is a short low-frequency sound effect marking the end of an appeal to receive God's love. A “CLICK HERE TO WATCH” prompt with an arrow appears as the speaker mentions a 90-day devotional and topics like Nephilim and Giants.\nTherefore, the sequence of events is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8.",

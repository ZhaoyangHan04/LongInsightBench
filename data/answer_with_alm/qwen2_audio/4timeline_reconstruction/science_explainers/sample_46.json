The subsequent events describe the technical aspects of the AESA radar and its advantages.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on video editing for help. The loud whoosh sound comes first, then complexity and cost appear on screen, after which there is a throat clearing. The jet engine noise starts overlapping as the complexity segment ends. Processing power appears next, followed by the note about analog components in some radar systems. Lastly, we see the 'not fast enough' message during the final segment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

This is followed by Event 2 where the planting of a tree in a forest is demonstrated as a way to remove CO2. Finally, Events 4 and 1 discuss additional methods to remove CO2, such as building soil carbon through cover crops and deeper-rooted crops, and then reviewing the impact of power plants on the environment.",

Then, there's a mention of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECS), which corresponds to event 5. Afterward, the speaker talks about reducing ocean CO2 levels, which maps to event 4. Finally, the video ends with a mention of enhanced weathering, which ties into event 7. Therefore, the correct order of events is 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6.",

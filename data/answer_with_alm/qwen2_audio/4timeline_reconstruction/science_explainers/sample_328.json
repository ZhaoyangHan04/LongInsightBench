    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is: (2) The host welcomes viewers to a \"spookly video\" and says \"After many requests\" about SCP-3008 in a dim furniture store. (6) Over an IKEA exterior and \"Euclid\" overlay, he explains the object class as Euclid. (4) The narrator says there are \"no accurate measurements\" and compares the interior to being bigger inside, as \"Estimated 10km (squared)\" is shown. (1) He explains the day-night cycle with ceiling lights and that 3008-2 shout \"the store is closing,\" as the store lights go off. (5) He notes exits exist but keep changing and that 14 people escaped and were amnesticized, while a white door and the SCP logo are shown. (3) He speculates 3008-1 might be a portal or wormhole to other dimensions, as network graphics and \"THANKS!\" appear.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n1. The title slide introduces the Ramachandran Principle as the speaker says “two atoms cannot occupy the same space.” (Option B)\n2. The speaker identifies two rotatable backbone bonds named phi and psi as the slide shows green and purple angle markers. (Option C)\n3. The presenter sets phi to 0° and says it is physically impossible due to clashes at all psi angles, while the graph labels every region as clashes. (Option A)\n4. A yellow plane highlights the peptide bond as the speaker explains its double-bond character prevents rotation. (Option D)\n5. With psi fixed at 165°, yellow/red markers show clashes as the speaker notes most phi angles are impossible. (Option B)\n6. On a Ramachandran plot, the speaker points out the “no clash region” for phi from −170° to −70°, corresponding to beta strands, with psi fixed at +165°. (Option C)\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option C: 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events is:\n\n1. The speaker introduces the concept of the phi dihedral angle and mentions that it is defined by four atoms, which implies that this event comes first.\n2. Next, the speaker describes how the cursor highlights Alanine's methyl side chain, which suggests that this event follows the introduction of the phi dihedral angle.\n3. After that, the speaker refers to van der Waals radii, which indicates that this event comes next in the sequence.\n4. The speaker then explains the Ramachandran plot and its phi/psi axes, and the cursor moving over alpha, beta, and turn regions, which implies that this event comes last in the sequence.\n5. Finally, with phi fixed at −80°, the speaker identifies psi ranges with \"no clashes\" for alpha helix and beta strand, which suggests that this event follows the previous discussion about the Ramachandran plot.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of events is option A: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

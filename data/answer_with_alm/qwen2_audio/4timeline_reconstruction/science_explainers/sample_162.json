    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\n  1. An AutoCAD diagram titled \"Sun On The Flat Earth\" is shown while the narrator claims the drawn angles prove the sun travels faster as it moves away.\n  2. Celestial clock frames over a lunar-like landscape play as a voice says the video has changed completely and the star trails match the original picture.\n  3. A 0°–90° scale comparing “No/Without atmosphere” to “With atmosphere” shows a white dot rising while the narrator explains the apparent sun moves faster in Cinema 4D.\n  4. A Tenerife time-lapse with data overlays appears while the speaker mentions the Canary Islands and says stars never set because they are too high (about 4,000 miles).\n  5. A sudden flatulence sound interrupts speech, immediately followed by the line, “Here is how the starfield would look if we remove the atmosplane.”\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 2.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is option B: 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6 -> 1.\nFirstly, there's a Dr. Zack/YouTube segment where Zach greets \"Flat Earthers,\" Steve joins, and they discuss refraction in the atmosphere as the solution to various visual problems on flat earth models. This occurs at time interval (4).\nNext, a cityscape diagram showing an \"Atmosphere or Atmosplane\" arrow and labels for \"Real Sun\" and \"Apparent Sun\" appears, along with the narrator insisting that the real sun is always higher and visible. This occurs at time interval (2).\nThen, a white screen appears with \"IF YOU,guys, CAN Help\" and an email address for the speaker to prove their theory with a 3D program. This occurs at time interval (3).\nAfterwards, black screens reading \"NOT US\" and \"NOT Them\" appear between mountain shots, as the narrator explains they added atmosphere in Cinema 4D, making the apparent sun go down. This occurs at time interval (5).\nFinally, with ambient music, a voice discusses sunrise/sunset in Salinas, California, saying the \"atmos plane\" is key and works correctly",

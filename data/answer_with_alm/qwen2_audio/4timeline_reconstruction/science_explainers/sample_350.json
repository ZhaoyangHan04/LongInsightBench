    "model_answer": "The correct timeline is option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.\n\nThe sequence begins with the speaker saying, \"This spring fascinates me,\" which indicates that the spring is being discussed but has not yet been shown or mentioned in relation to other events. \n\nNext, the screen shows \"water temperature about 75Â°C,\" which provides context for the subsequent event of the spring reforming at this temperature. This event is followed by the speaker mentioning \"75 degrees or so,\" reinforcing the connection between the water temperature and the spring's behavior.\n\nFinally, the caption \"Nickel Titanium Naval Ordnance Lab\" appears, which may be relevant to the preceding events but does not seem directly connected to them. This is then followed by the sound of a hair dryer starting as the speaker heats a nitinol wire, which is related to the previous events and occurs after the lab caption appears.\n\nTherefore, the events in the timeline are: The speaker mentions the spring, the screen displays the water temperature, the speaker references the temperature again, and the lab caption appears, followed by the sound of a hair dryer starting.",

Labels \"Force\" and \"Fulcrum\" appear by the wheel while gurgling water is heard.\n4. The text \"plastic deformation copper wire\" appears as the copper is bent too far.\n5. A close-up of a mesh tube labeled \"Stent\" appears as he introduces it as a commercial superelastic nitinol device.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

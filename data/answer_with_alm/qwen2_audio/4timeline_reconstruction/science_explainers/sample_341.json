This is then followed by event 3 where the speaker reads from a Wikipedia page about the Zamzam well.\n\nEvent 4 occurs after event 3, where the overlay \"I couldn't crystallize it\" appears, referring to Emoto's failed attempt to crystallize Zamzam water. This is followed by event 5 where the narrator describes how one drop of Zamzam water can form a unique crystal when mixed with 1000 drops of distilled water.\n\nFinally, event 6 takes place at the end of the clip, where the host invites viewers to leave their comments and subscribe to the channel. However, this event is abruptly interrupted by a loud explosion and static, which marks the end of the clip.",

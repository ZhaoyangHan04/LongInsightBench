    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. The timeline should start with an introduction, which is when the yellow title appears. Then comes the description of energy starvation, where the narrator mentions mTOR andAMPK. Next, we have the moment when the narrator describes how mTOR inhibits autophagy, which is represented by the red sweep. After that, there's a discussion about insulin and IGF-1, which leads into the final section where different protein sources are discussed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

This happens at the beginning of the video (1).\n\nNext, we see a Pac-Man gameplay clip, which might be used as an attention grabber or to illustrate a point related to autophagy (2). \n\nAfter the gameplay clip, the speaker starts talking about energy and autophagy again, and this is when the \"GLUCOSE KETONE INDEX FORMULA\" appears on the screen (3). This formula is mentioned later in the video when discussing how to estimate autophagy.\n\nIn the next segment, two male voices discuss how long autophagy takes and mention that carbohydrates and proteins can delay it (4). This discussion might be related to the previous segment where the speaker talked about energy and autophagy.\n\nFinally, we see a clip showing a ketogenic diet pie chart and an electronic sound effect, which marks the end of the video (6). This pie chart is used to summarize the macronutrient breakdown of a ketogenic diet.\n\n",

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is: (1) The speaker explains that ACV contains acetic acid and has a low pH for hair benefits. (2) The speaker concludes the scalp-cleaning explanation by saying ACV will get rid of potentially harmful bacteria without stripping oils. (3) In the beaker demo, water is added to olive oil and visibly separates as the speaker notes that water and oil don’t mix. (4) A person uses a spray bottle to apply liquid to the scalp while the speaker mentions using a pH-stabilizing spritz between washes because of ACV’s smell.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order would be option B: 4 -> 6 -> 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 7.\n\nThe sequence starts with a detailed geological chart appearing on the screen, which likely corresponds to step 4. This is followed by the speaker's discussion of different types of rocks, such as chalk, limestone, sandstone, and siltstone, which could correspond to steps 6 and 3.\n\nNext, there is an animation emphasizing distinct layers of rock, which could correspond to step 4 again. This animation may also reference the concept of the Millstone Grit and Coal Measures mentioned in step 2.\n\nAfterward, there is a visual of a volcano erupting, which could correspond to step 3. This event may also be connected to the concept of sedimentary events discussed later in the presentation.\n\nFinally, the speaker at a podium talks about \"all this mud flowed in at one time,\" which could correspond to step 6. This statement may also reference the concept of the Grand Canyon and the different layers of rock that make up its formation.\n\nThroughout the presentation, there are also references to patterned spherical fossils, which could correspond to step 7. These fossils may be used to support the theory of evolution",

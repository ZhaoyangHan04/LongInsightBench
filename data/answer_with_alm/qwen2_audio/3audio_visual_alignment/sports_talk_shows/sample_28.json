    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: A pack of runners mid-race on a blue track with one athlete in blue leading.\nExplanation: The audio describes the event as having a deep field of women all competing for three spots on the US Olympic team to Tokyo Japan later this summer. It also mentions Brittany Brown as the silver medalist from the 2019 Doha World Championships in the 200 meters. This information does not match any of the provided images. Option A shows Brittany Brown celebrating with an American flag, but there is no mention of celebration in the audio. Option B shows Allyson Felix sprinting in a red and white uniform with the number 5 on her chest, but again, there is no mention of Felix in the audio. Option D shows a close-up of empty starting blocks on the track, but there is no mention of blocks in the audio. Only option C accurately represents the event described in the audio.",

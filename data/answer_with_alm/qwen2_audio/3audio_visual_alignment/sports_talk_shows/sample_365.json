    "model_answer": "The option that best fits the visual description is A: Nathan Gorman in black shorts standing over a downed opponent, with the referee stepping in and raising his hand as BT Sport graphics identify him. This is because the commentary mentions a straight right followed by an uppercut, which leads to the opponent being knocked out, and the referee信号ing the end of the fight.

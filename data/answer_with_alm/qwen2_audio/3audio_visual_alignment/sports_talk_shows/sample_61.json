It only mentions that the technique involves off-balancing, using one knee as a block, and throwing the opponent over the shoulder. Therefore, options A, B, and C are all incorrect because they do not relate to the visual representation of the technique being explained. Option D, on the other hand, accurately describes the type of visual aid that could be used to demonstrate the technique.",

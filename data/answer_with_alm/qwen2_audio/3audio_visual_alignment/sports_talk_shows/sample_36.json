    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: A scoreboard shows 74–72 Bulls with 1:32 left in the third quarter as a player dribbles.\n\nIn the provided excerpt, the live game commentary is describing a specific moment during a basketball game. The commentator mentions a jump shot being taken by a player in a white jersey with number 23, who is successfully covered by blue-jersey defenders. At this point, the audience can be heard reacting in the background. The visual display on the screen during this moment would likely show the score, which is indicated as 74–72 Bulls with only 1:32 remaining in the third quarter.

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: He jokes about being below-average height for an NFL QB, mentions combine and pro day measurements, and sarcastically references a scheme with lots of one-on-ones.\n\nIn the audio, Luke Kuechly is talking about his draft position and how he was projected to be a top pick. In response, he humorously mentions his height and compares it to other quarterbacks who are taller. This indicates that he is aware of his height and uses it as a joke to make light of the situation. Additionally, he references combine and pro day measurements, which are common events for NFL prospects, further emphasizing his knowledge of his physical attributes. Finally, he sarcastically references a scheme that involves a lot of one-on-one drills, implying that despite his height, he is still able to compete effectively against taller players.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: D: He says Lax PC is an imaging telescope for soft X-rays and SX-T is a proportional counter for hard X-rays.\n\nThe speaker in the audio specifically mentions that they are using AstroSat data from two payloads - Lax PC and SX-T. He states that Lax PC is an imaging telescope designed to detect soft X-rays, while SX-T is a proportional counter that is sensitive to hard X-rays. Therefore, the correct pairing of the two payloads is Lax PC for soft X-rays and SX-T for hard X-rays.",

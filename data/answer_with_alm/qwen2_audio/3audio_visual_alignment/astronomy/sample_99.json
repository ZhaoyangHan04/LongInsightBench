    "model_answer": "The speaker is likely explaining option A: That by taking an image of two stars’ combined light over time, you can obtain a light curve to track brightness changes in an eclipsing binary, and since the stars aren’t resolved separately, spectra and photometry are used. This is because the term 'eclipsing binary' refers to a type of astronomical system where two stars orbit each other such that one star passes in front of the other, blocking its light. The resulting light curve shows the variation in brightness caused by the eclipse.",

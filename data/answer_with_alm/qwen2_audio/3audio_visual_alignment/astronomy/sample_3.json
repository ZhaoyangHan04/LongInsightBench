    "model_answer": "Based on the description provided in the audio, option D seems most likely the correct answer. The speaker mentions taking a photograph of a sunspot using a projection setup and advises photographing the screen, which suggests that something other than the sun is being projected onto the screen for viewing through the telescope. The other options do not seem to align with the context of the speech.",

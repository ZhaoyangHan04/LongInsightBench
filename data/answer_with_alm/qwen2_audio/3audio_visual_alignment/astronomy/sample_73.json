    "model_answer": "The answer would be either B (a scale bar labeled “100,000 light-years” spanning the frame) or C (labeled spiral arms reading “Perseus Arm” and “Scutum-Centaurus Arm”) as both of these elements would emphasize the distance of the solar system from the galactic center. Option A (a white line drawn from the bright galactic core to a yellow star in one arm, with on-screen text reading “25,000 LY”) does not accurately represent the visual element used to emphasize the distance, while option D (a circular Milky Way logo with the caption “Dark Matter Halo”) does not relate to the distance of the solar system from the galactic center at all.",

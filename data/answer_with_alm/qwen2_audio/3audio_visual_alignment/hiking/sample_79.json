    "model_answer": "The video would most likely match the narration by showing the hiker walking along a rocky path, which is described as a 'long gravel road through dense greenery' (option D). An information board or trail signpost might be shown if the hiker stops at a visitor center or comes across one along the way, but there is no explicit mention of either in the provided excerpt. A yellow trail signpost with a walking figure could also potentially be shown, but it is less likely since the path is described as rocky rather than well-marked.",

    "model_answer": "The swimmer's actions in the video are as follows:\n\n1. The swimmer notices three pieces at the bottom of a little crevice while diving.\n2. Upon realizing that one of the pieces is stuck, the swimmer carefully examines the situation.\n3. Next, the swimmer grabs a small bottle of liquid and carefully pours it into the crevice to see if that helps loosen the stuck object.\n4. After a moment, the swimmer notices that the liquid has started to work and the stuck piece begins to move.\n5. Finally, the swimmer uses a metal pick to gently pry at the stuck piece until it comes loose and floats to the surface.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Apply liquid from a small bottle directly into the rock crevice to help free it.",

    "model_answer": "The image that corresponds to the transcription appears to be option B: A spread of mixed finds laid out on a white paper towel, including coins and a black pipe-like item. This is because the transcription mentions finding a wheat penny and examining it closely, which suggests that the speaker has discovered some kind of treasure or coins. The image of mixed finds on a white paper towel aligns with this expectation, as it shows a variety of items, possibly including coins, spread out for examination.",

Since the question asks about what is shown on the screen during the speech, the correct option would be C: A close-up of a hand stretching a red rubber band across a wooden surface. This is because the audio mentions comparing the force of attraction between particles to stretching a rubber band, which is a visual aid often used in science education to demonstrate these concepts.",

In the video, after explaining how to solve second-order differential equations with constant coefficients, the speaker starts to discuss how to solve those with non-constant coefficients. They mention integrating both sides of the equation and the delta function, which is related to Green's functions. At this point, the whiteboard should show the symbol δ(x − x') along with terms G(x, x'), f(x'), and the note \"Algorithm for finding G(x,x')\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

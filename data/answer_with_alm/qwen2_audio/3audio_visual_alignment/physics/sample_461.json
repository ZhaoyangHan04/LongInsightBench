    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: A slide explaining that in allowed orbits the waves add with constructive interference.\nIn quantum mechanics, electrons exist in standing waves called electron orbitals, which are represented by mathematical equations known as wave functions. These wave functions describe the probability of finding an electron at any point in space. The allowed orbits are those for which the wave function adds constructively with other waves, resulting in a stable and predictable pattern of electron behavior. This constructive interference is due to the principle of superposition in quantum mechanics.",

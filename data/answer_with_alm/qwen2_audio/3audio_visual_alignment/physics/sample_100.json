    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The second equation gains an additional damping term, changing to x2' = -(g/ℓ) sin x1 − k x2.\nIn the provided excerpt, the speaker begins by introducing the concept of friction and how it affects the motion of a pendulum. They then define K as the friction coefficient and proceed to modify the second equation of the system of differential equations that describes the motion of the two pendulums. Specifically, they add a new term to the right-hand side of the equation representing the damping due to friction, resulting in the modified equation x2' = -(g/ℓ) sin x1 − k x2.",

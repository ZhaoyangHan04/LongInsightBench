    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: A circular network diagram labeled as a reference clock, with nodes and arrows linking around a ring.\n\nIn the provided excerpt, the narrator mentions that at event 3, the absolute time beat becomes a reference clock. This implies that there is a visual representation of time that serves as a reference point. The circular network diagram labeled as a reference clock best fits this description, as it visually represents time through the use of nodes and arrows that link around a circular pattern, providing a clear and organized representation of time.",

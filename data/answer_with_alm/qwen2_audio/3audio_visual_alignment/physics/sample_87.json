However, the mention of \"turning forces\" suggests that the next lesson will focus on rotating motion, which is related to turning forces.",

Also, there's no mention of a title or definition paragraph, so (C) is incorrect. Since the speech does not reference any specific shapes or diagrams, we can infer that (D) is also not correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

To demonstrate this concept, a close-up shot of the coconut resting on the slide is shown, along with the text \"Momentum is zero\" written on the slide. This helps viewers understand that the coconut is stationary and has no motion. The other options do not accurately represent the visual being discussed in relation to momentum.",

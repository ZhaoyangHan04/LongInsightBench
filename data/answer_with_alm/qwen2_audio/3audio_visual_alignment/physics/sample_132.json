    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: A static slide titled “Dynamic Weight” showing four stick figures with up and down arrows labeled “Lose Weight” and “Gain Weight.”\n\nThe audio describes a scenario where a heavy object is lifted up and down, causing it to feel heavier or lighter depending on the direction of the lift. The speaker then mentions using a digital force plate or electronic bathroom scale to measure the weight gain or loss. This indicates that the visual scene being referred to likely involves a display of some kind showing the weight measurement.\n\nOption A describes a man giving a presentation about weight gain and loss, but this does not match the context provided in the audio. Option B shows a hippo in a zoo, which has no relation to the topic of weight gain and loss. Option D shows two women walking past doors, which is completely unrelated to the topic of weight gain and loss.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is option C, as it matches the context provided in the audio and describes a possible visual scene that could be showing the weight measurement on a projector screen.",

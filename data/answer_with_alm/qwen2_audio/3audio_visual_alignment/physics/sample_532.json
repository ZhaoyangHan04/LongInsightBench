    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on physics for help. The work-energy theorem states that the work done by conservative forces equals the change in kinetic energy; here, it's only gravity that does work, so we have mgh = ΔK. We can rearrange this equation to get h = ΔK / m, where ΔK is the change in kinetic energy. Since only potential energy is conserved in a gravitational field, we have mg·L·sinθ = ΔK, where L is displacement from the reference point. This means that option A is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

    "model_answer": "The correct option should be based on the relationship between the radius r and velocity v in a circular motion problem in a non-inertial frame. The equation for centripetal acceleration in a non-inertial frame is given by a = (v^2 / r) * sinθ, where θ is the angle between the velocity vector and the radial direction. This implies that the radius r is related to the velocity v through the equation r = v^2 / g * sinθ, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. Therefore, the correct option is C: u^2 = 2g sinθ.\n\nAnswer: C: u^2 = 2g sinθ",

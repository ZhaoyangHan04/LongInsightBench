A black-and-white diagram of a seven-turn solenoid annotated with equations for the interior field would be the most appropriate representation of such a map, as it shows both the shape and strength of the field in a clear and concise manner.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on physics for help. The equation B_inside_solenoid = (μ₀N/L)I shows that the stronger the current I, the stronger the magnetic field B will be; also, the larger the number of turns N, the stronger the field will be; in addition, the closer the wire is to the viewer, the stronger the field will be. Therefore, the correct answer should include all these factors.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: The Ready light switches off and remains off.\nExplanation: As per the instructions given in the audio, pressing the \"Open Door\" button on the instrument causes the ready light to switch off and remain off. This indicates that the instrument is now ready for use. The other options do not match the visual change observed after opening the door.",

    "model_answer": "Option D: On this instrument, the sample stage remains stationary while the X-ray source and detector move.\nExplanation: The description in the audio indicates that the mechanical device (goniometer) is moving into position to begin a scan. This implies that the sample stage remains stationary while the X-ray source and detector move, which is consistent with option D. Options A, B, and C do not match the on-screen motion described in the audio.",

    "model_answer": "The visual on screen during the segment about a jet going faster than the speed of sound and a sonic boom should be option A: A jet creating a white vapor cone against a clear blue sky, with on-screen text explaining wave speed in m/s. This is because the description mentions the sound waves produced by the jet as it exceeds the speed of sound, and a sonic boom is a loud noise that results from the rapid expansion of air behind a moving object. The other options (a blue electric guitar, a white diagram of wavelength, and parallel lines diffraction) do not relate to the topic of sound waves and speeds.",

To calculate this value, the speaker performed some arithmetic operations on the initial velocity of the rocket (900 m/s) and the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²). After taking a square root and adding 30 seconds (the duration of the first stage of the launch), the speaker arrives at a final time of approximately 227.4 seconds.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on physics for help. The equation X= X0+V0t+1/2a(t^2) represents motion with constant acceleration a=30m/s^2, where X0 is the initial position, V0 is the initial velocity, and t is the time. Since X0=0, V0=0, we have X=1/2at^2. Substituting a=30m/s^2 and solving for t gives t^2=600, so t≈105.7s. The total time in air is 105.7+30=135.7 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

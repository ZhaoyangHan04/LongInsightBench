    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: A pulley setup displays two hanging weights connected by a green string on either side of the truck. \n\nThe narration mentions the forces acting on the object in equilibrium, which is the garbage gobler truck on the inclined plane. The forces are replaced by string tensions in the pulley setup, as shown in the visual aid. The strings and pulleys are used to balance the forces acting on the truck, with one string tension supporting the weight of the truck and the other string tension providing the counterforce needed to keep the truck from slipping backwards due to the angle of inclination.",

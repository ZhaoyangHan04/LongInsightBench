    "model_answer": "Answer: D: A row of smaller bar magnets, each labeled N and S, is shown with arrows pointing left.\nThe visual aid in the form of a row of smaller bar magnets with arrows pointing left helps to reinforce the point that breaking a magnet into smaller pieces does not create new magnetic poles, as the resulting magnets are still just smaller versions of the original. This aligns with the spoken content of the segment. Options A, B, and C do not directly relate to the topic of breaking magnets and creating smaller magnets.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Centered inside the circle with field lines radiating symmetrically outward.\n\nIn the provided audio, the speaker explains that if a bar magnet is placed outside a conducting surface, no net magnetic field will be induced inside the conductor because the magnetic field lines from the magnet will be cut off by the conductor's surface. However, if the magnet is placed inside the conductor, the situation changes. In this case, the magnetic field lines from the magnet will pass through the conductor, creating a magnetic field inside the conductor. The direction of the field lines will be radially outwards from the center of the conductor, as shown in option B.\n\nTherefore, when the speaker mentions keeping the bar magnet outside the surface, they are referring to the scenario where the magnet is placed outside the conductor, not inside it. This is consistent with option B, which describes the correct position of the magnet for inducing a magnetic field inside a conductor.",

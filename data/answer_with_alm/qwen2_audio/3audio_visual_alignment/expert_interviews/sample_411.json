    "model_answer": "The speaker is emphasizing option D: Meeting former animal experimentation industry workers in 2010 and realizing there was a story. This is evident from the context provided in the speech where the speaker mentions making a documentary on animal rights and wanting to make a bigger contribution by delving into a more serious topic such as animal experimentation. The mention of the phrase 'MAXIMUM Tolerated Dose' and 'WELLSFLED FILM CO.' likely refers to the film's title or production company, but without additional context, we cannot be certain.",

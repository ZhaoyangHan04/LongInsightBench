    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: Systemically important payment systems must meet the highest standards.\nExplanation: The speaker says 'A quarter of major banks activities are already hosted on the cloud,' but this statement does not mention the percentage of UK payments activities that are cloud-hosted. Option A is incorrect because it uses a different percentage (one third) and mentions UK payments activities instead of major banks' activities. Option B is incorrect because the speech does not discuss banking as a global spender on AI systems. Option C is correct because the speech mentions that AI could lead to leaner, faster, and more efficient operations in general, although it does not specifically say that AI will cause these changes in banking.",

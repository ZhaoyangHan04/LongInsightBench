    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Walking through the forest away from the river with a backpack.\nThe audio indicates that the speaker has been to the location before and knows where to find gold. They also mention carrying a backpack with them while walking through the forest away from the river. This suggests that they are searching for gold in the area and have likely already collected some samples. The other options do not match the context provided in the audio.",

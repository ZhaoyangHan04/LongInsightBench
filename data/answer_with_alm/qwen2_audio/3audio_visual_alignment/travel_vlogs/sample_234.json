    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: The table is cleared and the room becomes empty.\n\nExplanation: Based on the provided audio description, we cannot determine the visual actions of the people at the table during the mentioned time frame. However, it is possible that the sound of raw eggs being added to the hot pot suggests that the food is being prepared, and the sizzling sounds could indicate that the food is being cooked. This might lead to the assumption that the table is being cleared as the meal progresses, but without additional context, this remains speculative.",

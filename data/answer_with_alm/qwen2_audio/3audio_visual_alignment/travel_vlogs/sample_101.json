    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The man in a gray hoodie and cap is seated on the bed. This can be inferred from the transcription of the speech where the man mentions adding mood lighting and jokes about a dance party, indicating that he is sitting down. Option B is incorrect because the young woman in a white fleece jacket is only mentioned as being present, not seated. Option C is also incorrect because both the man and the woman are described as standing. Option D is incorrect because there is a speaker and at least one other person present in the room based on the transcription.",

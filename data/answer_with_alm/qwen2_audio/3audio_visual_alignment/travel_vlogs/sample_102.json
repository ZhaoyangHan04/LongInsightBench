By filling the bottle with water from a tap and then passing it through the filter, he is showing how the system works. The other options (picking up an orange bottle, strapping the bottle onto a bicycle frame, or pouring the bottle's contents into a glass) do not accurately describe the demonstration of the water filtration system.",

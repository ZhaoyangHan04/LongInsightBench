    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: The stove is disassembled with its grates removed.\nExplanation: In the audio, the speaker mentions that they need to clean the stove because it's used several times a day. This implies that the stove has been taken apart for cleaning, likely involving the removal of its grates. Option A describes lighting a small flame on the stove, which doesn't make sense in this context. Option C mentions a sink faucet running next to the stove, but there is no mention of a sink or faucet in the audio. Option D mentions a wall thermometer displaying a warning, but again, there is no mention of a thermometer in the audio.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is D: A lower-third banner reads \"Van Life Is Ugly\". This can be inferred from the context where the speaker mentions the state of the van and the need for more storage solutions. The lower-third banner is a common way to display text in videos, and it seems relevant to the topic of van life.",

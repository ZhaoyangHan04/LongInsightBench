    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: He holds up a hardened steel chain and a small device while gesturing toward the camera.\nWhen the male speaker says the hardened steel chain “can’t be cut with bolt cutters,” it implies that he is demonstrating the strength of the chain. To illustrate this point, he likely holds up the chain and a small device, such as a bolt cutter, and gestures toward the camera to show that the chain cannot be broken by these tools. This visual aid helps to reinforce the idea that the chain is strong and durable.",

Since the question does not specify which image is shown, it's best to select all available options for a comprehensive answer.\nAnswer: A: A black-and-white image of a clenched fist B: A serene winter landscape with snow-covered trees and a frozen lake C: A logo with a shield and the text “World Bank Paper Generator Society” D: The introductory slide with “Douglas Walker” and his title\nThe audio contains no verbal indication of what is shown on the screen, so we cannot rely solely on the speech for our answer. Instead, we must consider the context provided by the question and the images listed in the options. All four images seem relevant to the topic being discussed, but only A and D are mentioned in the speech. Therefore, they are the most likely options to be shown on the screen.",

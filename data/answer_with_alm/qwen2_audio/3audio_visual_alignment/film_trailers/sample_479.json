    "model_answer": "The answer is C: A boat's hull being polished in the shop. The phrase \"that is awesome\" suggests that the speaker is impressed by something they are seeing, and the context of a trailer rebuild and a black Mercedes van suggest that the scene is related to a vehicle or boat restoration project. The most likely option is therefore C, as polishing a boat's hull could be a part of the rebuilding process.",

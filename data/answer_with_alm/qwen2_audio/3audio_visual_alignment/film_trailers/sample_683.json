    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: A tight close-up of eyes—one pair glowing green and the other blue—staring intensely, signaling a confrontation.\nThis description matches the scene in the movie where Magnifico is shown gazing at the camera with an evil look in his eyes while a green light appears in them. The shot focuses on his eyes, creating a tense and foreboding atmosphere. The other options either describe different scenes or do not accurately reflect the visual elements mentioned in the audio clip.",

    "model_answer": "The answer should be based on the visual elements mentioned in the speech. After the Disney 100 logo appears, there's an aerial shot of the setting of the film, which shows the Kingdom of Rosas. Therefore, option B seems like the most likely answer since it mentions a cathedral-like hall and floating blue orbs, which could correspond to the visual elements described in the speech.",

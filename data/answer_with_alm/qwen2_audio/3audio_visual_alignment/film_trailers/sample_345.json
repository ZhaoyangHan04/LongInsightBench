    "model_answer": "The speaker is likely explaining that the scene was shot using a feature film camera, which is different from a smartphone or other consumer-grade cameras. Feature films often use professional equipment such as high-end cameras and lenses, as well as lighting and other support systems. The mention of NordVPN may be related to post-production tasks such as color correction or data security, but it's not directly related to the filming process. Therefore, the correct answer would be either B or C, depending on whether the speaker is discussing the equipment used during filming or post-production techniques.",

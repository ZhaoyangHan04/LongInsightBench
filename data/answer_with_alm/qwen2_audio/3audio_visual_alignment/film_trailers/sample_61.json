    "model_answer": "The answer should be option A: Two men seated at a dimly lit bar counter, watching a game on a television screen with bottles visible around them. This is because typically in a bar scene, when there is excitement over a sports event, viewers would be gathered around a TV screen watching the game, and there would be drinks and food visible on the counters or tables. The sound of cheering and a sports announcer excitedly proclaiming a home run and that the Cardinals have won suggests a live sports event being watched by a crowd, which aligns with option A.",

    "model_answer": "The line heard is option B: A male voice says, \"Whoa.\" This is because the transcription provided does not mention any dialogue or sound other than the child emerging from the refrigerator and the man smiling at him. Option A is unlikely because it doesn't fit the context of a child and a man in a domestic setting. Option C is also unlikely because it is too sudden and disruptive compared to the calm setting described. Option D is also unlikely because it is not a common sound in a domestic environment.",

    "model_answer": "The narrator says: 'Mike's got his hammock all set up' and then adjusts it. There is no direct mention of the narrator thanking Mike or mentioning how long Mike has been hammocking.

Therefore, the correct answer might be either A or C, depending on the specific wording used in the audio.",

Since the question asks about what is shown on the screen, we should look for descriptions related to visual elements in the audio. The only option that mentions a visual element is B: A person stands in a shallow stream, panning with a black bucket and green sieve nearby. This suggests that as the music starts playing, a scene showing this person in the stream might be displayed on the screen.",

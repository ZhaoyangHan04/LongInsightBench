    "model_answer": "The answer should be based on visual cues from the video. Since the question does not specify which part of the video is being referred to, any option could potentially be correct. However, since the narrator mentions the reliability of the Chinese pump and the highbanker, it's possible that the scene shows them in operation. \n\nTherefore, my best guess would be C: A wide shot showing the sluice box, the pump, and the blue tarp along the riverbank. This would allow for a clear view of all the equipment mentioned while also providing context of their location and use.",

This is evident from the transcription of the audio where the speaker says, \"so stay tuned and we'll be right back and I want to show you how we're going to do that so stay tuned and we'll be right back.\" The image of feet stretched out implies that the person has set up the tent comfortably with enough space for their belongings.",

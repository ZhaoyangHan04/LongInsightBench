    "model_answer": "The answer should be based on visual content. Since the speech does not specify what is being shown on the screen, it's impossible to determine the correct answer with certainty. However, among the provided options, only option A mentions a refrigerator, which could potentially be shown on the screen during the hand-washing station scene. Therefore, the most likely answer would be A: A small white refrigerator with two plastic containers sitting on top.",

The mention of a beautiful day on Lake Hartwell, a lake in South Carolina, suggests a lakeside setting. Additionally, the reference to a boat coming in and turning around implies that the speaker is likely near the water's edge. The other options don't fit the context as well as option D does.",

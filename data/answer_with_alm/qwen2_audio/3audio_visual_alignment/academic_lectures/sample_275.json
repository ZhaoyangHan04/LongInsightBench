    "model_answer": "Option C: A detailed lithosphereâ€“asthenosphere diagram labeling basalt, ocean sediment, and granite with arrows showing plate motion and magma formation.\nThe discussion about the Loma Prieta earthquake and transform motion likely requires a visual representation of the Earth's lithosphere and asthenosphere, which are the outermost and partially molten layers of the Earth respectively. A diagram showing the different types of rocks and their locations relative to plate motion would be helpful in understanding the concept of transform motion.",

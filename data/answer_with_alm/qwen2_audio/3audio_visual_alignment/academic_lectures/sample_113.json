    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on electrical engineering for help. When using Kirchhoff's rules to obtain three linear equations with three unknown currents, the augmented matrix is typically set up by listing the equation for each current along with its corresponding current-related unknowns. In this way, the augmented matrix is directly related to the original equations and helps in visualizing the connections between them.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

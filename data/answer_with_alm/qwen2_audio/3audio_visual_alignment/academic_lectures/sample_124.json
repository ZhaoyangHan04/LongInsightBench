    "model_answer": "I would select option B: An on-screen quote attributed to Jo Ann Robinson from 1954 discussing plans for a citywide bus boycott. This is because the audio mentions that one account describes Rosa Parks' arrest leading to a boycott, while the other is a letter outlining plans for a citywide boycott. The quote from Jo Ann Robinson discussing these plans would likely be found in a documentary or movie about the Montgomery bus boycott, providing visual confirmation of the second account mentioned in the audio.",

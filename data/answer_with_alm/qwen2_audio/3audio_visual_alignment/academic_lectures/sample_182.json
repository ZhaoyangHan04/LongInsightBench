    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: A mother breastfeeding her baby. The audio describes the oral phase of psychosexual development, which is characterized by the pleasure derived from sucking and feeding. This pleasure is most commonly associated with the act of breastfeeding, as it satisfies both the physical need for nourishment and the emotional need for security and bonding. The other options (A, C, D) do not directly relate to the concept of pleasure derived from sucking and feeding, which is central to the oral phase of psychosexual development.",

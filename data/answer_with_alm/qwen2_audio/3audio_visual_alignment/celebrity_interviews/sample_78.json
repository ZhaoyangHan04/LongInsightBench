    "model_answer": "The correct answer would be C: Both sit still while an off-camera house band plays softly. This is because the description mentions that during event 10, the host jokes about playing a mouth organ, and a playful trombone melody is played. There is no mention of either the host or the guest picking up or playing any instruments themselves. Therefore, it can be inferred that they are both sitting still while an off-camera house band plays softly in the background.",

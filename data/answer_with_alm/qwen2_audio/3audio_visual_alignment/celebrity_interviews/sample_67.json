    "model_answer": "The answer is C: The master bath features a massive brass tub.\n\nThe description in the audio corresponds to a master bath that has been transformed into an art studio, which is where the camera lingers. The space is described as having a wooden workbench, neatly organized paint tubes and brushes, and a sink by a big window. This indicates that the bathroom has been converted for artistic use, rather than just being a regular master bath with standard fixtures. Therefore, option C, describing the massive brass tub in the master bath, is the most likely correct answer.",

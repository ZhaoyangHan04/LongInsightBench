    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: A tight close-up of hands with long, decorated nails displayed alongside a social media post mentioning @sosobrat and color.\nThis can be inferred from the transcription provided, where the speaker mentions that BB Judy showed everybody her hands and that they had 'So So Brat' on her nails. This implies that there was a visual display of BB Judy's hands, likely in close-up, and that they were adorned with something that could be identified as 'So So Brat.' The other options do not match this description of the scene.",

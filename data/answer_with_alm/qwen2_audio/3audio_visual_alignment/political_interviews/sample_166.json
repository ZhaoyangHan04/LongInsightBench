Lower-thirds are typically used in TV interviews to identify the person being interviewed. However, since there's no mention of a lower-third in the transcript, it might have been intentionally left out, or the video was produced differently than usual. Therefore, we cannot confirm the presence of a lower-third based on the provided transcript alone.",

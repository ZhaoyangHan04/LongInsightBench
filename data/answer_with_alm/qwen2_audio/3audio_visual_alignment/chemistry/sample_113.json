    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on chemistry for help. When a female speaker says that 'Individual resonance structures do not exist,' it is likely that she is referring to the concept of resonance in organic chemistry. Since the description does not mention visual aids, we should look for auditory clues. The sound of bubbling indicates some sort of chemical reaction, which could be related to the topic being discussed. Therefore, option B seems like the most appropriate choice as it aligns with the content being described and the presence of the bubbling sound.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: A white bottle with a red label is poured into a yellow solution, which shifts to a more orange hue as it is stirred with a rod.\nIn the audio, the narrator describes the process of isolating chromium metal from stainless steel. To do this, he pours a solution containing sodium chromate into a yellow solution, which then turns orange due to the addition of sulfuric acid. This chemical reaction is used to extract chromium from stainless steel. The other options (boiling a blue solution, adding hydrogen peroxide to a dark liquid, covering a beaker with white paper) do not relate to the process of isolating chromium using sulfuric acid.",

When the speaker defines a meso compound as having an internal plane/line of symmetry and says such compounds can be achiral, he is likely referring to the concept of chirality in chemistry. At this point, the image on the whiteboard should show a representation of a meso compound with its plane of symmetry indicated.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

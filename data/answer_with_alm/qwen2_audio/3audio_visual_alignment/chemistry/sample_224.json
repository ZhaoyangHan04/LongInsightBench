    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: He says the car doesn’t have kinetic energy because it’s not moving in the picture, then adds that technically there’s a tiny amount due to atoms and molecules.\n\nIn the audio, the speaker explains that kinetic energy is the energy of motion. Since the car is stationary in the picture, it does not possess kinetic energy. However, he also acknowledges that there is a very small amount of kinetic energy associated with the atoms and molecules within the car.",

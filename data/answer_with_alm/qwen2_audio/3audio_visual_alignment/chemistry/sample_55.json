    "model_answer": "The correct answer would be either B (lattice-style diagram) or C (gradient of colorful test tubes). Both diagrams illustrate the concept of溶解反应 (dissolution reaction), which involves the transfer of dissolved species from the solvent into the solution. The molecular model shows individual sodium chloride molecules interacting with water molecules, while the lattice-style diagram emphasizes the formation of new bonds and the release of energy during the process. The gradient of colorful test tubes represents the distribution of dissolved ions over a range of concentrations, which can be used to estimate the Gibbs free energy change. The single hydrated ion illustration shows only the positively charged sodium ion being surrounded by water molecules, which does not fully represent the complex interplay between solvent and solute in a dissolution reaction.",

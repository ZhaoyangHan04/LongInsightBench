    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: A caution reading “Never draw air through a vacuum pump,” followed by a schematic cold-trap setup labeled with manifold, pump, condensed vapors, slush bath (Dewar), and the text “Always use a cold trap.”\n\nThis is because the audio describes the importance of using a cold trap when distilling liquid products under reduced pressure, which involves drawing vacuum to lower the boiling point. The narrator warns against drawing air through the vacuum pump, which could contaminate the product, and then shows a schematic diagram of a cold-trap setup that is essential for this process.",

    "model_answer": "The narrator says: 'So vacuum distillation let's check on the stage heads.' This indicates that she is about to start a vacuum distillation process and wants to monitor the progress. Therefore, the correct answer would be option C: She instructs to add boiling chips and stir to ensure smooth boiling during distillation.",

In this case, the computer is rendering a first-person game view of a wooden wall with a red bar and a 59% health indicator at a resolution of 1,000x1,000 pixels, which requires the computer to cast 1 million rays at a thousand by thousand resolution. This process takes time and resources, but the end result is a highly detailed and realistic image on the screen.",

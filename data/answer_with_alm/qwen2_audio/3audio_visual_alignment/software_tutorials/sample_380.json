    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: A copy dialog showing “Copying 730 items from Fresh Copy to portable_data” at around 12% complete.\n\nIn the audio, the speaker mentions that after deleting everything from the portable data folder, they copy a fresh build into it. This process involves copying files from the source location to the target location. The copy dialog will be visible during this process, indicating the progress of the file transfer. The other options mentioned in the question (deletion dialog, Kodi exit pop-up, and web browser) are not relevant to the process described in the audio.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer would be A: An Exit pop-up listing options such as Power off system, Custom shutdown timer, Suspend, Hibernate, and Reboot. \n\nThis is because when someone tries to exit a program in Windows, a pop-up window usually appears with various options to choose from, including power-off options. This is different from the other options listed, which are not typically associated with exiting a program in Windows.",

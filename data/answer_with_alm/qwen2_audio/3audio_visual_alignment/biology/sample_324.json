    "model_answer": "Option A: A static slide titled \"6. Formation of Articular Cartilage & Epiphyseal Plate\" showing a bone diagram labeled with articular cartilage, spongy bone, and the epiphyseal (growth) plate, plus a microscopic image of articular cartilage.\n\nThe speaker describes the process of bone formation through osteogenesis, which involves the transformation of bone tissue from its original state of cartilage. The epiphysis, or the end of a long bone, does not ossify and remains as articular cartilage, allowing for the formation of joints. The growth plate, found in the diaphysis of a long bone, also remains cartilage during early childhood and allows for interstitial growth of the bone. This information is presented visually in a bone diagram that shows the different components of bone tissue, including articular cartilage and the epiphyseal plate. Additionally, there is a microscopic image of articular cartilage to further demonstrate this concept.",

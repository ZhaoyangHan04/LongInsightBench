    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on film and television for help. The scene where the male narrator emphasizes sheep's sense of smell and scent glands is likely from the movie 'Babe', released in 1995. There is no split-screen or close-up shot of a sheep's ear with a swollen gland in this movie. Therefore, we cannot select option B. However, option A describes a possible depiction of seasonal changes in a ram's scent glands, which could be relevant to the scene. Option C does not seem to be related to the scene either. Option D only shows a shepherd in a rural field, without any mention of the sheep's senses or scent glands.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

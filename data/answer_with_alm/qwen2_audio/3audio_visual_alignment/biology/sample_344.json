The audio describes how light-activated rhodopsin activates phosphodiesterase which converts cyclic GMP to GMP and that cyclic GMP gates a cyclic nucleotide-gated sodium channel. This process occurs in photoreceptor cells of the eye, which detect light patterns and convert them into images. Therefore, option A best represents what is being displayed concurrently on the static slide.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

    "model_answer": "The narrator describes that after the optic chiasm, axons from the nasal retina (medial half) cross the midline and go to the contralateral hemisphere, while axons from the temporal retina (lateral half) continue into the optic tract and synapse in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, which then relays to the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe. Therefore, the correct answer is B: He explains that axons from the medial retina cross the midline at the chiasm to the contralateral hemisphere.",

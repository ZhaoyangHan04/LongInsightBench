    "model_answer": "Answer: A: An illustration of a brain and adipose (fat) tissue with arrows indicating leptin signaling and reduced food intake, titled “Leptin is an appetite suppressant from fat tissue.”\n\nThe audio describes how leptin is a hormone produced by adipose tissue that signals the brain to reduce food intake. The image used to illustrate this concept likely shows a diagram of the brain and adipose tissue, with arrows pointing towards the release of leptin and its effect on appetite. This type of illustration would effectively communicate the concept of the role of leptin in regulating energy balance.",

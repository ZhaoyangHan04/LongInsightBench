However, based on the provided description, the correct answer would be C: A goat illustrating one plane of bilateral symmetry. This is because all animals except sponges have a symmetrical body plan where the front and back halves are similar, and a goat has a single plane of symmetry through its midline.",

Based on the provided question and answer choices, I would select option D: Red annotations circling \"Dominant (85%)\" and \"Exoskeleton\" on the Arthropods slide. This suggests that there are visual elements on the slide, likely diagrams or illustrations, highlighting key characteristics of arthropods such as their dominant traits and exoskeletons.",

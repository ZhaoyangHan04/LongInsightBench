    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: A male voice starts describing hammerhead ribozymes.\nExplanation: The audio contains a male voice speaking in English, discussing the topic of hammerhead ribozymes. This speech can be heard starting at the 0.89-second mark and continues until the 7.56-second mark. Therefore, option C is the correct answer as it describes the event that occurred during the given time frame. Options A, B, and D are not relevant to the events described in the audio clip.",

    "model_answer": "Option A is the correct answer. The speaker is likely demonstrating the process of Group II intron splicing, which involves the attack of the 2' OH of a specific adenine on the 5' splice site, resulting in the release of the intron as a lariat. This process is often depicted through a diagram showing the structure of pre-mRNA before splicing, including the branch-point adenine, the 5' splice site, the lariat formation, and the subsequent exon ligation.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: A five-kingdom chart with Monera and Protista highlighted by a blue circle.\nExplanation: The audio describes how before the Five Kingdom classification system was developed by R.H. Whittaker, there was confusion about the classification of certain organisms. Protozoans were considered either unicellular or multicellular based on whether they had cell walls. However, this distinction did not take into account organisms like the protist Amoeba, which is unicellular but does not have cell walls. This led to inconsistencies in the classification system. To address these issues, Whittaker proposed the Five Kingdom classification system, which includes Monera (prokaryotes) and Protista (eukaryotes) as distinct kingdoms. The chart shown in the audio highlights these two kingdoms in blue to indicate their importance in the new classification system.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on biology for help. The audio describes that when Whittaker classified organisms into five kingdoms, things were very chaotic. For example, unicellular eukaryotes like amoebas were placed with multicellular animals just because they didn't have any cell walls. There were some organisms that weren't given a place at all, such as the organism 'Uglena', which can photosynthesize like a plant and move like an animal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

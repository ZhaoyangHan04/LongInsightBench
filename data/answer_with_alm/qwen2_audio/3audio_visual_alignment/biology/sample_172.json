    "model_answer": "The correct answer should be C: 75%. The Punnett square represents the probability of inheriting a particular trait or gene from each parent. Since we are talking about diseases that can be passed down in different ways depending on the disease and how many copies of a gene a child inherits, it's important to consider the genetic inheritance pattern. In this case, if the Punnett square shows three squares representing dominant traits and only one square representing recessive traits, then the overall chance a child will be affected by the dominant trait is 75% (3 out of 4 squares).",

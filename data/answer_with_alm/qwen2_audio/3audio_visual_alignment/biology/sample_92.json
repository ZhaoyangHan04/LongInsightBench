    "model_answer": "The visuals that might appear during this section of the narration could include:\n\nA: A white screen showing the chemical formula “H2” centered, as molecular hydrogen is mentioned as a reduction product in the narration.\nB: Microscopy footage labeled “MC1061 - RIF 10 µg/ml” with a timestamp and 10 µm scale bar, as reduced iron-sulfide centers are often visualized using microscopy techniques.\nC: A sequence of geometric iron coordination complexes (triangular, square, and cubic) with formulas and charges on a white background, as these are commonly depicted when discussing iron chemistry and its role in biological systems.\nD: A white slide stating that 78% of reactions happen spontaneously under equilibrium and 98% under steady-state with 100-fold more substrates, as this information is unrelated to the topic of organic cofactors and their replacement by molecular hydrogen.\n\nTherefore, the possible answers are B and C.",

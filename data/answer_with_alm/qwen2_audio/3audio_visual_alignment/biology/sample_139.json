    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: They directly make glucose during the light-dependent reactions.\nAccording to the audio, C4 plants use a different process called photosynthesis which involves direct conversion of carbon dioxide into glucose during the light-dependent reactions. This process is more efficient than the process used by C3 plants, which fix carbon twice before donating it to the Calvin Benson cycle. Therefore, option D is the correct answer as it accurately describes the process used by C4 plants.",

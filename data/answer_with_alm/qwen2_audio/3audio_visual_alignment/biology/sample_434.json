    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. In the provided audio clip, no visual content is described. Therefore, option C cannot be the correct answer. Option A describes the context of the speech but does not specify what is shown on the screen. Option B describes a possible display on the screen, which could be related to the topic of the speech, but without additional context, it cannot be confirmed as the correct answer. Option D is a non sequitur and can be eliminated as a candidate. Since we have no other information, we must select “answer: Unable to answer” as our best guess based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: Unable to answer",

    "model_answer": "A: A yellow diagram labeling ‘primary antibody,’ ‘secondary antibodies,’ and ‘AMH protein.’ B: An illustration showing a goat and a mouse with arrows labeled ‘anti-mouse antibodies’ and ‘mouse antibodies.’ C: A light blue card with cartoon test tubes joking about a rodeo under the text ‘Why is it called a Western Blot?’ D: An image of Edwin Southern holding an umbrella with labels indicating he ‘Invented’ a related method. Answer: All of the above. The audio describes how biotech companies use goats to produce anti-mouse antibodies for visualizing signals in a Western blot. This process involves injecting mice with goat antibodies, which then circulate in the goat's bloodstream and are harvested from the goat's blood. These antibodies are then used to detect specific proteins in a sample by binding to them in a Western blot. Therefore, all four options accurately describe aspects of this process.",

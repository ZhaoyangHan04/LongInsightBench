    "model_answer": "The correct answer would be A: Technical overlays show mode/field-of-view labels like “NAR IR 3° R” and later “MFOV IR 8° L” as the bright dot is tracked. These overlays help confirm that the object's motion is being tracked by the camera and not due to the object itself moving.",

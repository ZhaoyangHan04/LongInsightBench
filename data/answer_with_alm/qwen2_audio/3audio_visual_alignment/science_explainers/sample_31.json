    "model_answer": "The visual shown on screen at that moment is likely option C: A starry sky time-lapse with a bright comet moving across and timestamps like “2016.90.”\n\nThis is because the passage describes observing the first ever object that wasn't from the nearby star system, which suggests a visual observation of space. The mention of the object's brightness, size, and motion also points towards a celestial object, such as a comet or asteroid. Additionally, the use of timestamps implies that the object was captured over time in a video or animation, making it more likely that the visual shown is a time-lapse of the night sky.",

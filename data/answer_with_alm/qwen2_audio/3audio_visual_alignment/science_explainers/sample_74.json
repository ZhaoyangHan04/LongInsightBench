    "model_answer": "The answer is A: A labeled cross-sectional diagram showing “CARBON GRANULES,” “DIAPHRAGM,” and “TO LINE CIRCUIT & BATTERY.”\n\nThis diagram would align with the narration because it visually represents the components mentioned in the description of the carbon granule microphone. The cross-section likely shows the internal workings of the microphone, including the carbon granules, diaphragm, and battery connection.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: The diaphragm visibly moving back and forth as it reproduces sound.\nExplanation: In the audio, the narrator mentions that the fluctuating component they are observing is the speech current. This indicates that they are likely examining a device that converts electrical signals into sound waves, such as a radio or a microphone. In this type of device, the diaphragm is a critical component that moves back and forth in response to changes in the electric current, which ultimately produces sound through vibrations. Therefore, option D correctly represents the visual cue that corresponds to the speech current.",

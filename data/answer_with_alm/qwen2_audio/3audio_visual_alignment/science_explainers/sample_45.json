    "model_answer": "The correct answer would be B: A silhouette of a person beneath shimmering Northern Lights with a stylized Earth in the foreground. This is because the description provided mentions auroras dancing across the night sky far to the south, which implies that the visual shown on screen will depict this natural phenomenon occurring in the night sky. The other options do not match this description as they either do not relate to the night sky or do not depict a scene with auroras.",

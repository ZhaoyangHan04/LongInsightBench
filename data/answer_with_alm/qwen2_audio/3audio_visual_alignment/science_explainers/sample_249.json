    "model_answer": "Option A: The screen reads \"Gamma Ray Photon\" with a zigzag line arrow pointing to the right, representing emitted gamma radiation.\n\nExplanation: In the video, after explaining how electrons and positrons annihilate and produce gamma radiation, the visual representation on the screen shows the result of this annihilation process. There is a description of gamma radiation being emitted as a zigzag line arrow pointing to the right. This indicates that the correct option is A, which accurately represents the visual display during the segment.",

    "model_answer": "The visual appearance at that moment would be option C: a static cluster of blue and green spheres on a white background without any title. This is because pair production results in the creation of a particle and its antiparticle, which would appear as two separate entities in the visualization, likely represented by blue and green spheres. The other options do not accurately describe the visual outcome of pair production.",

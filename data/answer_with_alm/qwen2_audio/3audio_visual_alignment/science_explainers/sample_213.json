    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: An inset image labeled “Clash!” showing atoms overlapping.\n\nIn the audio, the speaker mentions that clashes between atoms must be avoided, which forces proteins to adopt certain structures. To visualize this concept, an inset image labeled \"Clash!\" may be shown, indicating areas where atoms are too close together and would cause a clash. This image helps illustrate how the avoidance of clashes contributes to protein molecular structure.",

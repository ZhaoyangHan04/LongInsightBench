This discovery laid the foundation for modern calculus. To visualize this concept, a stamp featuring Augustin Cauchy with mathematical equations and a cityscape in the background would be appropriate.",

    "model_answer": "The narrator is discussing the contributions of mathematicians like Archimedes, who lived in the 3rd century BC, and how their work laid the foundation for calculus, which emerged nearly two thousand years later. They also mention other notable figures such as Pierre de Fermat, Galileo Galilei, and Johannes Kepler. Therefore, the correct answer would be C: Later figures in mathematics and science, naming Fermat, Galileo, and Kepler.",

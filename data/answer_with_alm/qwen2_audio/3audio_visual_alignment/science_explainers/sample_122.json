    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: The beaker labeled \"olive oil + ACV\" appears cloudy but not fully mixed.\n\nIn the audio, the speaker mentions that apple cider vinegar (ACV) completely interrupts the oil when added to it. This means that the two substances do not mix well, resulting in a cloudy appearance. The other beakers show different combinations of olive oil and water or shampoo, which either do not involve ACV or have a fully mixed appearance, indicating that they do not interrupt the oil as described by the speaker.",

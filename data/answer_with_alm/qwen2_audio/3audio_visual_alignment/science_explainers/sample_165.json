    "model_answer": "I cannot listen to the audio as my access is limited to text-based interactions. Based on the provided description, option D seems most likely, as it mentions a 'periodic table that gradually fills in with element boxes,' which could correspond to the visual elements appearing on the screen during the spoken segment. However, without hearing the audio, I cannot confirm this with certainty.",

    "model_answer": "The answer should be D: A comparison of the atomic structures of Lithium and Sodium using yellow circles with black dots to show electron configurations. This is because the audio describes how the properties of sodium are identical to the element directly above it, which is lithium. To visualize this, a comparison of their atomic structures would be helpful, showing how they have similar electron configurations despite having different atomic numbers.",

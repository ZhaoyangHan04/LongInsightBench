    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Mumbai is more crowded than Delhi because the narrator gives Mumbai’s density as 25,000 people/km² versus Delhi’s 10,000 people/km², and these density figures are shown next to the city names on screen.\n\nThe narration states that there are 1.4 billion people in India, which is our population size. To find out about our impact, we must understand how crowded the nation is. In this video, we will talk about the different ways we can measure and understand our impact on the planet. This includes looking at factors such as population density, which is the number of people living in a particular area per unit of land. \n\nThe on-screen annotations provide additional context by showing the population densities of Mumbai and Delhi alongside their respective sizes. This helps us visualize the difference in crowdedness between the two cities. Therefore, option A is the correct answer as it accurately reflects the information provided in the audio and on-screen annotations.",

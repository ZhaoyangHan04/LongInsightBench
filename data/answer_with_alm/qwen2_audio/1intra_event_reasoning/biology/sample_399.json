    "model_answer": "The audio describes that endospores are highly durable, dehydrated cell forms with thick cell walls and additional layers for protection. It also mentions that they are formed by certain gram-positive bacteria like Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium difficile. These details align with options C (Endospores can remain dormant for thousands of years) and D (Germination typically occurs when conditions become more favorable for growth). However, the audio does not directly mention sporulation being triggered by adverse environmental conditions or endospores actively carrying out metabolic reactions during dormancy. Therefore, options A and B are not fully supported by the provided information.",

    "model_answer": "The amino acids were formed through a chemical reaction that involved a continuous spark discharge passing through a flask containing gases and water. This electrical discharge led to the formation of organic polymers, which then reacted further to produce amino acids like glycine, alanine, and aspartic acid. Therefore, the correct answer is option A.",

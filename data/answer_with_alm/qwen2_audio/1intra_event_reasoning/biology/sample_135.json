    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because the 2' OH of a specific adenine within the intron attacks the 5' splice site to create a branch (lariat), after which the 3' OH of the 5' exon attacks the 3' splice site to ligate the exons.\nDuring group II splicing, the intron is first cleaved by the spliceosome at its 5' and 3' ends, creating two mature exons and a lariat containing the remaining intronic sequence. The lariat forms when the 2' OH of a specific adenine within the intron attacks the 5' splice site, creating a branch. This reaction is followed by the 3' OH of the 5' exon attacking the 3' splice site to ligate the exons together. This process is catalyzed by various proteins involved in splicing, including the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex and the U2 snRNP subunit.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology for help. The hammerhead ribozyme has two active sites where it can cleave RNA strands. It recognizes a hairpin loop in the substrate and cleaves it at specific positions, generating a long RNA concatemer as the initial product. This concatemer can further be cleaved by the ribozyme again to generate smaller RNA molecules.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

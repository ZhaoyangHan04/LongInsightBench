    "model_answer": "The sequence shown in the Punnett square is likely intended to illustrate how inheritance works, where the probability of inheriting a trait from parents increases with each successive generation. The initial 75% value represents the probability that an individual may inherit the trait from one parent, while the subsequent increase to 100% suggests that when both parents pass on the same gene, the offspring has a high probability of inheriting the trait. This concept helps explain how diseases can be passed down in different ways depending on the disease and the number of copies of a gene a child inherits. Therefore, the correct answer would be A: To illustrate that the likelihood of an affected child can vary by scenario and that the risk is independently “reset” for each pregnancy, regardless of previous outcomes.",

Firstly, she identifies the pulmonary trunk and inserts a probe into it, showing that the probe connects to the right ventricle. Then, she traces the superior vena cava into the right atrium, confirming that it carries blood to the lungs. Next, she confirms that the probed vessel (likely the pulmonary artery) carries blood from the right ventricle up towards the lungs. Finally, she follows the aorta emerging from the left ventricle to demonstrate systemic outflow from the right side.",

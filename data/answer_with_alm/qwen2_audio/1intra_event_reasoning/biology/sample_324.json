    "model_answer": "Answer: D: Increased matrix from chondrocyte division crowds the mid-region, and crowding—not cell death—triggers calcification.\nThe audio describes that increased matrix production from chondrocyte division leads to crowded conditions in the mid region of the cartilage model. This crowding triggers calcification through a process called osteogenesis, which involves the conversion of bone-forming cells into bone tissue. The immediate cellular outcome is the formation of calcified matrix around the crowded chondrocytes.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. Let’s solve this step by step. We know that the primary ossification center initiates at the center of the diaphysis where the nutrient血管 penetrate the cartilage. Osteoblasts differentiate from the osteogenic cells around the血管, and they start to secrete bone matrix. As time goes by, the center expands outward from the middle. Capillaries also grow into the calcifying cartilage during this process. Therefore, we can see that option A best fits the sequence of events described in the audio and the accompanying text.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

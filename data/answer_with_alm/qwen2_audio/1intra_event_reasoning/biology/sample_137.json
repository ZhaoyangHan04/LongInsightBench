    "model_answer": "The answer is A: They form nodules where rhizobia fix nitrogen, which the narrator says enriches the soil when such plants are grown.\n\nIn the provided audio clip, between 00:00:56.434 and 00:01:28.298, the image shows root hairs with bacteria entering via an infection thread into nodules. This process is called nodule formation, which occurs when legumes like peas and beans interact with soil bacteria called rhizobia. Rhizobia live in soil and form specialized structures called nodules on root tips. Within these nodules, they undergo a process called nitrogen fixation, where they convert atmospheric nitrogen gas into a form that plants can use. This process enriches the soil with nitrogen, making it more fertile and suitable for plant growth. Therefore, the correct answer is A, as nodule formation is essential for nitrogen fixation and soil enrichment.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: A leaf is modified into a tendril, as shown and labeled for Lathyrus on-screen, and the leaf base may be pulvinate (swollen).\n\nIn the provided excerpt, the speaker describes a leaf modification observed in the genus Lathyrus, which has been transformed into a tendril. This transformation is indicated by the term 'modified into a tendril' in the description. Additionally, the speaker notes that the leaf base of such modified leaves may be 'pulvinate,' meaning swollen or rounded at the base. Therefore, option A accurately reflects the content of the audio regarding leaf modification in Lathyrus and its leaf base characteristics.",

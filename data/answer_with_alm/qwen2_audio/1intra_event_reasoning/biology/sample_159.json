The reason for discarding filaments is that only the anthers are inoculated into a medium (with components like glutamine, L-serine, and inositol) to induce androgenesis, while filaments are unnecessary for culture.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A, B, C, D. The distinction between direct and indirect androgenesis is based on the number of cell divisions that occur during the process. In direct androgenesis, microspores behave like a zygote and directly form an embryoid that develops into a plantlet without any previous cell division. In contrast, indirect androgenesis involves repeated cell divisions of microspores to form a callus tissue, which then differentiates into haploid plantlets. Therefore, the correct options are A, B, C, and D.",

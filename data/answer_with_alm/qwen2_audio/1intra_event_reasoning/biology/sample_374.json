    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because linoleic acid has double bonds and fewer hydrogens, creating kinks and flexibility, whereas palmitic acid is fully saturated and packs tightly.\nIn the audio, the speaker mentions that fatty acids with double bonds flow more easily compared to those without. This is because the double bonds create kinks in the chain, which allows for more flexibility and ease of movement. Palmitic acid, on the other hand, is a saturated fatty acid with no double bonds, leading to a tighter packing and less mobility. The fact that the model shows palmitic acid and linoleic acid side by side also helps to convey this concept, as the difference in shape becomes apparent when comparing the two.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: It forms the cellâ€™s boundary, and without it homeostasis would be disrupted.\nThe bilayer diagram on screen shows two stacked lipid molecules, which is typical of a cell membrane composed of lipids. The speaker describes how lipids are responsible for forming the cell's boundary and maintaining homeostasis. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate conclusion based on the provided information.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because the membrane selectively permits cargo in and out, which the speaker likens to control officers, and the slide bullets explicitly note a “selective barrier” and “transport of nutrients and waste.”\n\nThe presentation compares the plasma membrane to airport passport control because both serve as barriers that regulate what enters and exits a system. The plasma membrane controls the passage of materials into and out of the cell, while airport passport control ensures that only authorized individuals and goods are allowed through. This selective barrier is crucial for maintaining the proper functioning of the cell, just as airport security is essential for ensuring the safety of the airport environment.\n\nThe slide details support this analogy by highlighting the key functions of the plasma membrane. The bullet points mention the \"selective barrier\" and \"transport of nutrients and waste,\" which are critical components of the cell's function. Additionally, the image of the plasma membrane with its two layers further emphasizes the idea of a controlled barrier, much like the layers at a airport passport control.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: It catalyzes joining glycerol with three fatty acids into a triglyceride by removing atoms from glycerolâ€™s hydroxyl groups, resulting in water release.\nThe video demonstrates the dehydration synthesis reaction where the enzyme, lipase, catalyzes the formation of a triglyceride by removing atoms from glycerol's hydroxyl groups and adding them to the fatty acids. This process results in the formation of a new bond between glycerol and fatty acids, with the release of water as a byproduct.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: It visualizes DNA polymerase as a concrete example of enzyme specificity: this enzyme synthesizes new DNA with the correct nucleotides, illustrating that specific reactions require specific enzymes. The video shows a DNA replication diagram labeled with DNA polymerase to emphasize that this enzyme plays a crucial role in replicating DNA, ensuring that the genetic material is replicated accurately. This helps viewers understand that enzymes have a specific function and are essential for various biological processes.",

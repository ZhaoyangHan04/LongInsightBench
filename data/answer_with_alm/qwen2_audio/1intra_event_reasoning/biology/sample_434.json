    "model_answer": "The correct statement is: C: The secondary antibodies are modified so they can be visualized on the membrane and amplify the signal.\n\nIn the provided audio and visual aids, it explains that after the primary antibodies bind to the target proteins, secondary antibodies are added to the mixture. These secondary antibodies have been modified to carry a fluorescent tag or another marker that allows them to be visualized under a microscope. This step helps in amplifying the signal so that the presence of the target proteins can be detected more clearly.",

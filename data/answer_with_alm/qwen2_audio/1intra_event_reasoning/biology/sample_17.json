    "model_answer": "The correct reasons are B and C. Algae are often considered plant-like because they lack a true plant body with differentiated leaves, stems, or roots, and they are usually unicellular. However, some algae do form multicellular structures under certain conditions. Additionally, while many algae are photosynthetic and have cell walls, these characteristics are also shared by other groups of organisms such as bacteria and some types of fungi. Therefore, they cannot be solely relied upon to distinguish algae from other groups. Heterotrophy is not a characteristic that distinguishes algae from plants; in fact, some algae are photosynthetic and can be either autotrophic or heterotrophic depending on their lifestyle.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because hydrogen is less dense than air and diffuses into the porous pot faster than air diffuses out, creating excess pressure that pushes the U-tube liquid down in the closed end and up in the open end.\nExplanation: During the given interval, hydrogen is supplied to the porous pot which means it will diffuse into the pot. Since hydrogen is less dense than air, it will diffuse into the pot faster than air can escape. This creates an excess pressure at the bottom of the pot where the porous pot is located, which pushes the water level down in the closed end. At the same time, since there's no mechanism to prevent the hydrogen from entering the open end, the water level will also rise in the open end due to the lower pressure. Therefore, we can conclude that the liquid levels fall in the closed end and rise in the open end because of the difference in diffusion rates of hydrogen and air and resulting pressure changes.",

    "model_answer": "The factors mentioned in the audio that can increase the rate of diffusion are increasing the temperature and having a large concentration gradient between the two substances being mixed. Therefore, the correct answer would be option B: Having a larger difference in concentration between the diffusing agents.",

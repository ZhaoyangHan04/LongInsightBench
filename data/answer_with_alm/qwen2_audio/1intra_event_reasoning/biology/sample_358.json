    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Their surface-exposed middle amino acids are divergent, while the first 71 and last 46 amino acids are identical.\nFliC and FliB are two proteins from the flagellar apparatus of bacteria. The difference in their antigenicities is due to the unique sequence of amino acids in each protein. The surface-exposed middle amino acids are particularly important as they are exposed to the environment and could potentially be recognized by antibodies. Since FliC and FliB have different sequences in these regions, they are considered distinct antigens.",

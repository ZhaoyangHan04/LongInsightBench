The video indicates that the kidney diagram is still visible on the screen at 00:04:17.699, and it remains there as the narrator continues speaking about other parts of the urinary system until 00:05:10.058. This suggests that the kidney diagram is used as a visual aid to help explain the anatomy being discussed.",

    "model_answer": "The reason for dividing the kidney into labeled segments at 00:05:34.027 to 00:05:46.070 is to align the broader back-view diagram with vertebral landmarks rather than for surgical use. This helps in creating a clearer and more accurate representation of the kidney's position in relation to the spine and other anatomical structures.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer would be A: By showing that the pharynx is divided into the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx, and explaining that the epiglottis (seen in the diagram) closes the windpipe during eating.\nThe audio describes how the different parts of the pharynx work together to route air and food appropriately. It mentions that the pharynx is divided into three sections - the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx. The oropharynx is where food goes after leaving the mouth, and it connects to the esophagus. The laryngopharynx is where the voice box is located, and it also connects to the esophagus. The epiglottis is a piece of cartilage that closes the windpipe (trachea) during swallowing to prevent food from entering the lungs.\nThe diagram in the presentation also supports this explanation by showing the division of the pharynx into different sections and the position of the epiglottis.",

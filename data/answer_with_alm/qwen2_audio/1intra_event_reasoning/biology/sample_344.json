    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on neuroscience for help. In visual phototransduction, light-induced reduction of intracellular sodium ions is achieved through the following sequence of events: When light hits the rod outer segment, it triggers the hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate (cGMP) by the enzyme phosphodiesterase, generating guanosine monophosphate (GMP). The decrease in cGMP concentration causes the opening of cyclic nucleotide-gated sodium channels. This results in increased sodium influx into the photoreceptor cells, which leads to membrane hyperpolarization. Therefore, option A correctly explains this process.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on neuroscience for help. Letâ€™s solve this step by step. We are looking for a pattern that ensures each hemisphere processes the opposite visual field. This happens because axons from the temporal retina cross at the optic chiasm, leading to the processing of contralateral fields in each hemisphere. This is supported by the figure showing fibers crossing at the chiasm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

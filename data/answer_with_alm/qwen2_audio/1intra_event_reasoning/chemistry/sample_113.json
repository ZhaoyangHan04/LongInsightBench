    "model_answer": "The instructor proposes determining whether a molecule has a formal charge by comparing each atom’s typical valence electrons to what is shown in the drawn structures to spot mismatches (indicating a formal charge). The visuals on the whiteboard support this method by showing resonance structures with differing numbers of electrons around the atoms, which helps identify potential formal charges.",

    "model_answer": "The speaker asserts that individual resonance structures do not exist because the actual molecule is a composite with partial pi density distributed over the region bearing the formal negative charge, which is reflected by multiple drawn structures connected with arrows on the “Resonance Structures” whiteboard as he points and gestures. This is supported by the on-screen depiction of the whiteboard with multiple structures connected by arrows, indicating that the molecule's resonance is not limited to a single structure.",

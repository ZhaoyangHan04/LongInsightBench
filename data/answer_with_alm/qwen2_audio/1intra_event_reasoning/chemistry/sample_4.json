    "model_answer": "The options (B) and (C) indicate that carbon dioxide gas was produced during the reaction. In option (B), the chemical equation shows CO2(g) as one of the products, which directly implies the production of carbon dioxide. In option (C), the presenter's explanation that carbonate reacts with acid to form water and carbon dioxide provides a general example of a gas-forming reaction, which could potentially be applicable to the current scenario. Options (A) and (D) do not specifically relate to the production of carbon dioxide.",

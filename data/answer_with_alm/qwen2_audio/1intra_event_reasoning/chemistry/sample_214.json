    "model_answer": "B: To connect a water aspirator via a gas takeoff adapter so noxious gases are removed under a gentle vacuum, as advised.\nThe narrator specifies that a red hose should be attached to the condenser for inerting or anhydrous reaction conditions or for the removal of unwanted gases. This indicates that the purpose of attaching the red hose is to facilitate the removal of noxious gases from the system by connecting it to a water aspirator via a gas takeoff adapter. This setup ensures that the noxious gases are safely removed under a gentle vacuum, rather than being直接 vented into the room under strong vacuum, which could be hazardous.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: A Dean–Stark trap is used with a low-density, immiscible organic solvent so the solvent–water azeotrope condenses and water accumulates in the trap; progress can also be gauged by the milkiness of the azeotrope.\nIn this setup, water is removed from the reaction mixture during reflux by passing the mixture through a Dean–Stark trap filled with a low-density, immiscible organic solvent like pentane or hexane. As the water vapor from the reaction mixture passes through the trap, it forms an azeotrope with the organic solvent. The azeotrope is highly concentrated and has a distinct appearance, which can indicate the amount of water removed from the reaction mixture.\nTo monitor the progress of the reaction, the change in the color or clarity of the azeotrope can be observed. Additionally, the weight gain of the drying agent, such as calcium chloride, can be measured to determine the amount of water removed from the reaction mixture.",

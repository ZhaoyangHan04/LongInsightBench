    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Because the slide shows the recipe serves five and asks about serving ten, and the male speaker explicitly confirms that all ingredients (not just cheese) need to be doubled.\n\nThe visual context supporting this conclusion is the slide shown during the presentation, which indicates that the original recipe serves five people but needs to be adjusted for a larger group of ten. The male speaker then confirmatory states that all ingredients, not just the cheese, must be doubled to feed the additional people. This ensures that there is enough food for everyone and maintains the integrity of the dish.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The ratio is 1 N2 : 3 H2 : 2 NH3, and balancing the equation is necessary to satisfy conservation of matter and mass and to enable correct stoichiometric calculations, as shown and stated in the clip.\nExplanation: In the provided time frame, the speaker emphasizes that the stoichiometric ratio for the Haber-Bosch process is 1 N2 : 3 H2 : 2 NH3. Balancing the equation is crucial because it ensures that the number of atoms of each element is conserved during the reaction. This is important for accurate calculations of the amount of reactants and products involved in the process.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: A vacuum filtration setup was available and used, rapidly drawing off liquid and necessitating the switch to hand-squeezing.\nExplanation: The video shows a person wearing gloves and carefully pouring a cloudy, foamy liquid into a paper-lined beaker. Then, a white mass is forced through a strainer筛查. This process indicates that they are likely using some form of filtration method to separate solids from liquids. In this case, the use of a vacuum filtration setup would make sense as it can quickly draw off liquid, leaving behind the solid particles. The need for gloves suggests that there may be some risk of contamination, and the use of a strainer could be a safety precaution to avoid direct contact with the liquid or solid.",

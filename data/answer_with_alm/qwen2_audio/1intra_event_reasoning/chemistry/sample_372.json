    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on chemistry for help. Litmus is a pH indicator that changes color between red and blue depending on the pH of the solution. Therefore, if blue litmus turns red, the liquid is an acid; if red litmus turns blue, the liquid is a base.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

    "model_answer": "The conclusion drawn is that the solution is either neutral or has a pH value close to 7, as both red and blue litmus indicators remain unchanged. This observation supports the idea that the solution does not have a strong acid or base characteristic, which would cause the litmus indicator to change color. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Both solutions are neutral water; red litmus stays red and blue litmus stays blue.",

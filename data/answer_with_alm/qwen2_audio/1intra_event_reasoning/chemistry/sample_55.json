    "model_answer": "The solvation process is described as thermodynamically favored because the overall Gibbs energy of the solution decreases. This is shown in the diagram with a central cavity and arrows labeled “Creation of Cavity” and “Insertion of Solute,” which illustrates the steps of solvation. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

    "model_answer": "The distinction between solvation and solubility is based on their definition and the concept of dynamic equilibrium. Solubility refers to the maximum amount of solute that can be dissolved in a solvent at a given temperature and pressure, while solvation is the interaction between solvent molecules and dissolved particles. This distinction is reinforced through the use of visual aids such as a gradient of colorful test tubes that represent solubility versus solvation. Additionally, the on-screen text explicitly contrasts these two concepts. Therefore, the correct answer is A: The narration describes solvation (dissolution) as a kinetic process quantified by a dissolution rate in moles per second, whereas solubility is a concentration at dynamic equilibrium; on-screen, a gradient of colorful test tubes appears beneath text explicitly contrasting solvation and solubility.",

    "model_answer": "The lesson likely justifies both the order and the final formula for hydrochloric acid by stating that the non-metal should be written first, so Cl comes before H, and this is a general rule for writing chemical formulas. The specific example used in the video may involve explaining that the positive ion (H+) has a lower valency than the negative ion (Cl-) and therefore comes first, but this would be a secondary point of discussion rather than the main focus of the lesson.",

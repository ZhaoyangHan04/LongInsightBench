    "model_answer": "The reason for the presenter labeling the drawn molecule as a “meso compound” on the whiteboard is because the molecule has one chiral center and exists as a pair of enantiomers, which satisfies the definition of a meso compound provided by the speaker. The fact that the molecule has multiple chiral centers is mentioned but not directly relevant to the classification as a meso compound. Option A correctly explains this concept.",

    "model_answer": "The relationship indicated on the whiteboard is that diastereomers result from inverting one stereocenter (not both) and are not mirror images. This means that they have different physical properties and may show different chemical behaviors. The option A correctly defines this relationship.",

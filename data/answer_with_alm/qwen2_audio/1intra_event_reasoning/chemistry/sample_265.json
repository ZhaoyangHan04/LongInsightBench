    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Adding almost-white anhydrous copper sulfate to heated water produces the blue solution; once dissolved, the flame is turned off and the beaker is moved to cool.\nWhen copper(II) sulfate is dissolved in hot water, it forms a blue solution due to the formation of hydrated copper(II) sulfate, which has a characteristic blue color. In this reaction, heat is used to dissolve the copper(II) sulfate, and once the dissolving process is complete, the flame is turned off and the beaker is moved to cool. This helps to prevent further reaction and ensure that the solution remains stable.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Subtract the filter paper’s mass from the final mass: 3.96 g − 1.50 g = 2.46 g of copper.\n\nExplanation:\nIn the video, it is mentioned that after filtering, the mass of the solution was measured to be 3.96 grams. The filter paper used in the process also has a known mass of 1.50 grams. To determine the mass of the copper produced, we need to subtract the mass of the filter paper from the total mass of the solution. This gives us the mass of the copper product: 3.96 g - 1.50 g = 2.46 g.",

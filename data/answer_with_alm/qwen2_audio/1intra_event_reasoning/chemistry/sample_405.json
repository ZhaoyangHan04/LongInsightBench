    "model_answer": "The video likely progresses through these visual aids to demonstrate the concept of phase transitions: from a solid (ice) to a liquid (water), and then to a gas (steam). The series of images helps viewers visualize how temperature affects the intermolecular forces that hold matter together in different phases. Option A best fits this description as it explains the physical changes that occur when heat is applied to a solid, causing the molecules to gain energy and break strong attractions, leading to melting.",

    "model_answer": "The purpose of this segment is likely to demonstrate the concept of absolute zero and the change in kinetic energy as temperature decreases below absolute zero. By comparing the simulations at 1°C and −1°C, the speaker may be illustrating how the kinetic energy of particles drops as temperature decreases, approaching absolute zero where all motion stops according to the third law of thermodynamics. Therefore, the correct answer would be B: To show that particles stop moving completely at −1°C, proving kinetic energy can be zero or negative.",

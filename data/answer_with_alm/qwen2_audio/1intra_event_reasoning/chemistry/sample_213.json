    "model_answer": "The reason for starting distillation immediately after adding the acid is that the addition of acid caused the amines to react, producing thick fog. This indicates that the mixture likely contained a lot of water as a byproduct of the reaction, which needed to be removed through distillation to purify the benzaldehyde product. Therefore, the correct answer is A: The added concentrated HCl caused the amines to react, producing thick fog, so he started distilling benzaldehyde right away to obtain a clearer, less yellow product.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on chemistry for help. When a solution is stirred, the heat generated by the chemical reaction is dissipated into the surroundings. When the temperature reaches the boiling point of the solvent, the solution will start to boil, which leads to vigorous bubbling.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

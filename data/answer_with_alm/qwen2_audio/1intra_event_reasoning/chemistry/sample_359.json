This is evidenced by the on-screen display of the reaction equation 2OH-(aq) → O2(g) + 2H+(aq) which represents the oxidation of hydroxide to oxygen gas at the anode. The other options do not match the information presented in the segment.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Zinc and copper are referenced in the audio, and the screen shows water breaking down to hydrogen instead of zinc plating (Zn + 2H+ → Zn2+ + H2). The narration mentions that when these metals come into contact with water, they start to plate out, but in this specific scenario, something goes wrong, and hydrogen is produced instead of zinc plating.\n\nThe screen also shows a side reaction where water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen. This reaction is shown to demonstrate why zinc does not plate out in aqueous solution. In this case, the reaction produces hydrogen gas instead of zinc metal, which prevents zinc from plating out.",

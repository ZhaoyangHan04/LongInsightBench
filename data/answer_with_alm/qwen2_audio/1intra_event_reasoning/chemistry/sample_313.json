    "model_answer": "The conditions provided suggest that the benzene diazonium salt is formed under relatively mild conditions, which may make it unstable. Additionally, the instructor's remark implies that the salt must be handled immediately to avoid decomposition. Therefore, option A seems like the most likely answer: because the salt is unstable and needs to be used right away. The other options do not seem to directly relate to the need for immediate handling of the benzene diazonium salt.",

    "model_answer": "The halide/cyanide groups are introduced into the aryl ring by the Sandmeyer reaction using Cu2Cl/HCl, Cu2Br/HBr, or CuCN/KCN; it generally gives better yields than the Gattermann reaction. The preferred method is likely the Sandmeyer reaction because the instructor mentions that it generally gives better yields. However, it's worth noting that the specific conditions and reagents used can influence the yield and selectivity of the reaction.",

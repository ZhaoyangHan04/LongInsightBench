    "model_answer": "The video transitions from a calm water droplet to a molecular diagram of salt water with labeled cations and anions to illustrate how polar substances dissolve in polar substances, as demonstrated by the dissolved Na+ and Clâ€“ ions in salt water. This helps viewers understand the concept of polarity and its effect on dissolving ionic substances. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Because salts separate into mobile ions surrounded by water molecules, which the speaker notes can conduct electricity.\n\nThe electrolyte label is attributed to dissolved salts because they dissociate into positively charged cations (ions) and negatively charged anions, which are free to move in a solvent like water. These charged particles can conduct electricity when placed in an electric field or when they come into contact with electrodes. The speaker emphasizes that it's the ions themselves that conduct electricity, not the water molecules. This concept is fundamental to understanding electrochemistry and the behavior of electrolytes in solutions.",

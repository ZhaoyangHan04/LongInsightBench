    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Because iron is oxidized to insoluble iron hydroxide that will settle, allowing the sodium chromate solution to be siphoned off.\n\nIn the video, the speaker adds hydroxide to the yellowish solution, which likely contains iron(II) ions. The purpose of adding hydroxide is to oxidize the iron(II) ions to iron(III) ions, which forms insoluble iron hydroxide. This process occurs quickly, so the speaker needs to let the mixture settle to allow the iron hydroxide to form and sink to the bottom. Once the mixture has settled, the speaker can then siphon off the clear sodium chromate solution above the iron hydroxide layer.",

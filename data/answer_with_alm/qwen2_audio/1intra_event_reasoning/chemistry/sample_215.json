    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because the slide labels ΔH as positive (Endo) and notes decomposition only around 1100 K at 1 atm, while the speaker explains it requires significant energy and only occurs at extremely high temperatures—so at STP there isn’t enough energy to drive it.\nThe enthalpy change (ΔH) of a reaction indicates whether the process is exothermic (releases heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat). In this case, the enthalpy change is positive (endothermic), indicating that heat is absorbed during the reaction. Additionally, the reaction only occurs at elevated temperatures, such as around 1100 K, suggesting that it requires significant energy to occur. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), which is typically around 298 K and 1 atm, there may not be enough energy available to drive the decomposition of CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g).",

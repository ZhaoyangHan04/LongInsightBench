    "model_answer": "The answer should be based on the visual information provided in the time interval mentioned. After adjusting the wavelength selection on the monochromator (option A), the desired wavelength is allowed to pass through a slit and hits the sample. The intensity of light passing through the sample is detected by the detector, which builds up the absorption spectrum over time. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: A slit is placed after the monochromator to pass only the chosen wavelength to the sample, and a knob is adjusted to scan many wavelengths while the detector records intensities to build the spectrum.",

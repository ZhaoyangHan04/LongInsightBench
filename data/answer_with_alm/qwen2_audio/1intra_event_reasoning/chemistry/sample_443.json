    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Use a cold trap to protect the pump oil by condensing vapors, and never run the pump open to the atmosphere.\nThe screen in the video emphasizes the importance of using a cold trap when operating a vacuum pump. This is because it helps to condense any vapor that may be present in the system, which could damage the pump's oil if allowed to enter the pump's interior. Additionally, the video warns against running the pump open to the atmosphere, as this can also cause damage to the pump's oil.\nTherefore, option A correctly explains the recommended practice for operating a vacuum pump, which includes using a cold trap to protect the oil and avoiding direct exposure of the pump to the lab atmosphere. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they either go against the recommended practices or suggest actions that could harm the vacuum pump.",

    "model_answer": "The correct sequence is A: Evacuate the system first by setting valves correctly, start the pump, open the manifold to the pump, allow the vacuum to stabilize, and only then cool the trap.\n\nThis order ensures that the trap is depressurized before any liquid is introduced into the system, which prevents vapor loss. Once the vacuum is stable, the trap can be cooled, and the liquid can be added without risk of vapor explosion. Finally, theæ³µ can be started with all ports open to the atmosphere to complete the evacuation process. Option B is incorrect because it starts the pump before evacuating the system, which can lead to vapor loss. Option C is incorrect because filling the trap with solvent beforehand would defeat the purpose of evacuation. Option D is incorrect because starting the pump with the trap already chilled would create a vacuum seal that is difficult to break later on.",

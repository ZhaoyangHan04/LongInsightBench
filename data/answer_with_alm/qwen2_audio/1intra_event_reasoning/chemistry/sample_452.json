    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on chemistry for help. The presenter determines the reaction order with respect to H2 by comparing experiments where [H2] is held constant. In experiment 1, when [H2] is doubled, the rate also doubles; in experiment 2, where only [Cl2] is varied, the rate also doubles. Since both experiments show that the rate changes proportionally to the concentration of H2, the reaction must be first-order with respect to H2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A, B, C: The repeated blue screen titled 'Reactant Order' signifies a focus on reactant order, while the speaker explains orders are usually whole numbers but can also be fractions or decimals. The 'Finding Rate Laws' slide is used here to calculate the rate for Experiment 4, and the speaker walks through that computation. The reappearance of the blue 'Reactant Order' screen emphasizes that, for this lesson, they will stick to whole-number orders, as the speaker explicitly states.",

    "model_answer": "The reason for the clip cutting from glowing charcoal to an electric stove and then showing a person lifting the lid of a pot is likely option B: To illustrate a more reliable, controllable heat source (stove vs coals) and to introduce the lid’s role in retaining vapors—analogous to preventing solvent from boiling away. The clip may be demonstrating a chemical reaction that requires a stable heat source, and the transition from glowing charcoal to an electric stove emphasizes the superiority of a controlled heat source over an uncontrolled one like coals. Additionally, the lifting of the lid might be shown to illustrate how a lid can help regulate temperature and prevent evaporation during a reaction.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: The speaker explicitly says the boiling and condensing can continue as long as the hot plate is hot and the condenser is working, and the tall, tower-like drawing with horizontal lines depicts the vapor path up and condensate returning down. This indicates that the heat flow from the heater is sustained by the condenser, which allows the boiling and condensing to continue continuously. The arrows on the drawing also show the direction of heat flow and vapor movement, further supporting this interpretation.",

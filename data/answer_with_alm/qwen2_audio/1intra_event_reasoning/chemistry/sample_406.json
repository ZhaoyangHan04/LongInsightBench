    "model_answer": "The correct answer would be A: By showing that for a fixed mass of carbon, the mass of oxygen that combines with it is in a simple whole-number multiple (16 vs 32), illustrating a 1:2 ratio.\n\nIn the provided time frame, the speaker mentions that the law of multiple proportions states that for any two elements combined in a fixed ratio, the ratio of their masses is always the same. This is demonstrated through the comparison of CO and CO2, where a fixed amount of carbon is combined with different amounts of oxygen, resulting in a ratio of 1:2 between the masses of carbon and oxygen.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because losing an electron reduces the number of electrons, shrinking the electron cloud and decreasing the ionic radius.\nIn an ionic bond, a metal atom donates an electron to a nonmetallic atom, forming a positive ion (cation) and a negative ion (anion). As a result of losing an electron, the number of electrons in the cation decreases, causing the electron cloud to shrink. This reduction in the size of the electron cloud leads to a decrease in the ionic radius of the cation compared to its neutral atom.",

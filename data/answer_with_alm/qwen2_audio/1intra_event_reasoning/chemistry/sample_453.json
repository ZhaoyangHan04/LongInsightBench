    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: They were adhered to a sample holder with polymer clay and the top surface of the grown crystals was positioned coplanar with the holder; a CAUTION: RADIATION HAZARD sign near the control panel visually indicates an XRD instrument.\nIn the provided time frame, the samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The samples were adhered to a sample holder with polymer clay and the top surface of the grown crystals was positioned coplanar with the holder. This setup is typical for XRD experiments to ensure that the crystal faces are parallel to the incident beam for accurate diffraction patterns. The presence of a CAUTION: RADIATION HAZARD sign near the control panel indicates that the experiment involves radiation, which is a common feature in XRD instruments.",

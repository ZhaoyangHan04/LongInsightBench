    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because the problem asks how much energy is released, so the magnitude (3220 kJ) is reported, while the negative sign in the equation and narration indicates release.\n\nIn chemistry, when we calculate the change in energy (ΔH) for a chemical reaction, we consider both the heat absorbed (endothermic) and the heat evolved (exothermic). The value of ΔH represents the total amount of energy exchanged during the reaction. \n\nHowever, when reporting the final energy value, we often drop the negative sign because it does not convey meaningful information about the direction of the energy change. In this case, the handwritten calculation shows that the final energy value is 3220 kJ, which simply means that 3220 kJ of energy was exchanged during the reaction, regardless of whether it was absorbed or evolved.",

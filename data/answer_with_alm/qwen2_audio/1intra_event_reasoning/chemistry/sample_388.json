    "model_answer": "Option A seems likely the correct answer, as it connects the man-made fusion experiment with the natural nuclear reactions happening in the Sun. The video may be using this comparison to emphasize the scientific ambition of the ITER project and how it relates to the immense power of the Sun.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Three helium-4 nuclei fusing to form carbon-12 and B: Carbon-12 fusing with a helium-4 nucleus to form oxygen-16. These are the most energetic nuclear reactions known, which occurred during the formation of stars and contributed significantly to the composition of elements in the periodic table.",

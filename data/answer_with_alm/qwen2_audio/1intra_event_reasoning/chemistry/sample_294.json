    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Two-photon absorption via a virtual state, depicted by two lower-energy arrows passing through a labeled “virtual state” between ground and excited states, with a green arrow indicating fluorescence.\nThe speaker explains that in this mechanism, two photons are absorbed simultaneously from a higher frequency source, which causes the molecule to enter a virtual state. This virtual state allows the molecule to transition directly to an excited state, resulting in fluorescence with longer wavelengths. The diagram on the slide depicts this process clearly with two lower-energy arrows passing through the virtual state before reaching the excited state.",

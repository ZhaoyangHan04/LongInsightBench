    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because they belong to the sixth and seventh periods in the long-form table, but are pulled out to save horizontal space, with colors showing their period connection.\n\nIn the video, the speaker mentions that the periodic table is divided into seven periods, each containing a varying number of elements. The table shown in the segment highlights the periods and the elements within them. It appears that the rows displaying the sixth and seventh periods are separate from the rest of the table and are colored to indicate their connection to the next period. This format is used to save space on the page while still providing a clear representation of the periodic table's structure.",

    "model_answer": "Based on the provided excerpt, we cannot definitively conclude the electrical conductivity of the purple-labeled elements. The speech only mentions that the periodic table is essential for chemistry and highlights the use of a calculator and hand calculations. It does not provide specific information about the conductivity of the purple elements. Therefore, the answer is unknown without further context.",

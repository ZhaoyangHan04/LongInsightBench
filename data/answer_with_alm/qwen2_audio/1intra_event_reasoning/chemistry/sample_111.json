    "model_answer": "The conclusion that only CO2 is produced because no coupling occurs at the anode is supported by both the board's sequence “RCO2 -> RCO -> R+ + CO2” and the narration about forming an alkane. This is because the sequence shows a continuous loss of oxygen, suggesting that the electrons from the anode are reacting with the carbon dioxide to form CO2. The narration also indicates that only water is formed at the cathode, implying that no other reaction occurs at the anode besides the formation of CO2. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",

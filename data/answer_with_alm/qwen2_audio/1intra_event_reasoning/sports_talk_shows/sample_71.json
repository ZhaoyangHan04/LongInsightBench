    "model_answer": "The purpose of the montage is to discuss Mickie James' career and her impact on WWE, leading up to her eventual return to the company. Option A correctly explains this by stating that the montage highlights her legacy and the controversial nature of her return, which was seen as a \"pointless comeback\" due to the circumstances surrounding it. The other options either do not relate to the content of the montage or are not supported by the provided information.",

    "model_answer": "The segment juxtaposes Batista addressing a live arena under WrestleMania branding with later sit-down interview shots to show the contrast between the grandiose spectacle of a WrestleMania event and the more intimate setting of a sit-down interview. This contrast highlights how WWE carefully controls the narrative around their wrestlers, even down to the way they present their returns to the public. The narrator implies that while the WrestleMania event was meant to be a triumphant return for Batista, the actual impact on fans and the wrestler himself was negative due to poor handling by WWE. The subsequent interviews were likely used as a way to mitigate this negative impact and to continue to promote Batista as a major talent within the company. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because the sandwich is overloaded with turkey, ham, and two fried eggs, making it thick and messy, as seen when itâ€™s cut open and the yolk oozes out.\nThe audio contains visual evidence of the sandwich's condition by describing how it looks when cut open, revealing the messiness caused by the excessive amount of fillings. The mention of the yolk oozing out further supports this option as it indicates that the sandwich is very dense and unable to hold together properly.",

    "model_answer": "The characteristics described include that teasers allow adjustments to spreads or totals by adding or subtracting points, they require all legs to hit, and they are listed under 'Teaser' in the sportsbook betting section. The visual presentation supports this by showing the 'Teaser' option in the menu under 'Betting 101'. However, there's no mention of the actual odds, which would be crucial for placing a teaser bet. Also, the absence of any information about the risk associated with teasers implies that this detail might not be discussed in this particular segment. Therefore, I cannot select A, B, or D as the correct answer.",

Adding the helmet made the cone drill more difficult because the reflective visor used by many pros makes it harder to catch the ball, as stated by the speaker in the audio. Additionally, the speaker indicates that both he and another man run the cones wearing helmets, suggesting that the helmet does affect the difficulty of the drill.",

    "model_answer": "The prompt for the switch to a crossbar challenge seems to be related to an action in the game, possibly a goal or a chance to score, which led to the decision to attempt a shot at the crossbar. The loud thud indicates that there was an object, likely a ball, hitting the crossbar after the player attempted to score, and this event marks the beginning of the crossbar challenge as indicated by the on-screen title. Therefore, the correct answer would be A: They had tied in each other's sports, and a loud thud from a ball hitting the bar occurs as the on-screen CROSSBAR CHALLENGE title appears.",

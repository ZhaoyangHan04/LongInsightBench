    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Because MMA gyms donâ€™t enforce attendance, leading to less dedication, competition, and improvement opportunities; and his 'Isaacgomezzzz'/'Tenacity' logo remains on-screen. This conclusion is based on the speaker's observation that in contrast to other forms of wrestling where attendance is mandatory, MMA gyms do not have such requirements. This leads to less dedication and competition, which in turn limits the improvement opportunities for athletes. The 'Isaacgomezzzz'/'Tenacity' logo remains on-screen throughout the segment, further emphasizing the branded advice nature of the content.",

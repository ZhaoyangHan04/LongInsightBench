    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Curry hit the go-ahead three, Wiggins used the foul to give around the final second, and Draymondâ€™s defense closed it out.\n\nCurry hit a go-ahead three-pointer at 00:02:53.798, which gave the Warriors a 112-111 lead. Then, with around 15 seconds left, Wiggins was fouled while shooting a three-pointer. He made both free throws, increasing the Warriors' lead to 114-111. Finally, with about 5 seconds remaining, Draymond Green defended a shot by Devin Booker, which led to a Suns turnover. The Warriors were able to run out the clock, securing the 113-112 win.\n\nTherefore, option A correctly describes the sequence of events that led to the Warriors' victory in the final moments of the game.",

This directly contradicts the claim made in the opening sentence of the event that KD is better than Curry.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A, C\nThe narrator's statement about the lack of a podium and the casual atmosphere implies that the focus was on having fun and making progress rather than winning a competitive race. Additionally, the mention of an \"MVP\" suggests that there were informal recognitions given to participants rather than official awards. Visuals such as riders taking turns on features and the presence of crowd noise also support this interpretation. The fact that rankings were announced over the PA and judges were tallying scores does suggest some level of competition, but it is not the main focus of the event as implied by the other evidence provided.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because the audio explains pushing the opponent toward a corner, moving to the side, and throwing them forward, while the live demo visually shows the thrower dropping to their side (sacrificing position) rather than staying upright.\n\nIn the provided audio segment, the presenter describes the technique as a sacrifice throw, emphasizing that the thrower moves the opponent towards a corner, moves to the side, and then throws them forward. This description aligns with the live demonstration, where the thrower can be seen dropping to their side, effectively sacrificing their own position to execute the technique.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the audio does not mention that the Yokowakare was entirely replaced by this new technique. Option C is also incorrect because the historical note does not inherently dictate that all sacrifice throws must involve leaving the feet and performing a standing sweep. Option D is incorrect because the demonstrator does leave their feet during the execution of the technique.",

    "model_answer": "The video includes a tent decorated with British flags because it is likely associated with the runners who have completed the first loop of the race. The presence of the flags helps to establish the nationalities of the runners, which is particularly relevant when mentioning a UK runner like Henrik Boorey. Therefore, options A and B are correct. Option C is incorrect because the Gore logo on a jacket does not necessarily indicate that the race organizers are British. Option D is also incorrect because the red headwear worn by another participant does not confirm their nationality.",

    "model_answer": "The narrator's tone shifts from celebration to disappointment due to the revelation that Damian Hall did not complete Loop 5 of the race despite initially leading. This is supported by the on-screen update mentioning that Damian Hall took a different route, which led him to ultimately drop out of the race. The mood change is also indicated by the narrator's sigh after mentioning Damian Hall's situation.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: He switched to an Andrew Benintendi model with a smaller handle to get more whip, says he hit three home runs using it, and the segment shows an at-bat with the audible crack of the bat.\n\nThe audio indicates that the speaker made a significant change by switching to a different bat model, which led to an immediate improvement in his hitting performance. The mention of hitting three home runs using the new bat model provides evidence of the change's effectiveness. Additionally, the video footage showing the audible crack of the bat when it makes contact further supports the idea that the switch led to enhanced power and speed in his swings.",

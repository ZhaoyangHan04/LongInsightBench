    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Kyle Sherman left a ten-pin to end Game 1 outright for the Kingpins, which is why the blue team celebrates. \n\nIn the provided excerpt, the commentator mentions that Kyle Sherman struck out to force a roll-off. This means that there was no other option available for the Kingpins to continue the game, so they had to roll the ball on the ten-pin to see who would win the frame. The fact that the red team celebrated indicates that they believed they won the frame, and therefore the game, because Kyle Sherman's strikeout forced them into this situation.\n\nLater in the game, when L.A.X needed only one pin to win the match, a ten-pin miss occurred. However, according to the commentary, this miss did not affect L.A.X's outcome because they still needed three strikes in the following roll-off to win the game. Therefore, option D, an equipment malfunction causing the tie, is incorrect. Option C, a rules infraction triggering the roll-off, is also incorrect because there is no mention of any rules violation in the provided excerpt.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because the ball was not touched on the play, as confirmed by the crew chief. \n\nAccording to the rulebook, if a team challenges a call and video replay confirms that the ball did not move during the challenged play, the original call stands. In this case, the referee initially called it a foul, but Minnesota challenged the call based on the belief that the ball was touched. After reviewing the replay, the crew chief confirmed that the ball was not touched, leading to the change in the ruling.",

Additionally, his assist and steal numbers are also positive, indicating that he is contributing beyond just scoring.

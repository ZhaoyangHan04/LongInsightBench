    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because their gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as they descend, and the narrator notes that momentum is gained as speed increases.\nAccording to the on-screen explanation, the cars gain kinetic energy as they move downhill because the potential energy they possessed due to their position on the hill is converted into kinetic energy. This conversion occurs as they move downward, losing potential energy and gaining kinetic energy.\nThe narration also supports this by stating that the cars are gaining momentum as their speed increases. This implies that the energy they have acquired is due to the conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy while moving downhill.",

    "model_answer": "The primary reason the coconut comes to a stop after rolling down the slide is option A: Energy is lost to friction during the motion. As the coconut rolls down the slide, it encounters frictional forces that gradually reduce its speed and eventually cause it to come to a stop. The other options may also play a role, but friction is the most significant factor in bringing the coconut to rest.",

In this case, the space twin is moving at a high velocity along the x-axis compared to the stationary observer, so time passes slower for the space twin. This means that the space twin will have less time passing for him than for the stationary observer, which is demonstrated by the shorter duration of the outbound and inbound legs of the journey in the animation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

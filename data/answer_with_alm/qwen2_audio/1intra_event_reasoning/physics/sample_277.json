By not cluttering the screen with axis labels, the instructor can better highlight the motion of the red particle and the equations on the chalkboard, which might contain important information for understanding the lesson.",

To determine the displacement of a particle in space, we use its position vector that starts at the origin and ends at the location where the particle is. Using the position vector, we can uniquely determine the position of an object in space.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

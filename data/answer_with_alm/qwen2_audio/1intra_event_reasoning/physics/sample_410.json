    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on physics for help. The animation shows a computer color map of a cylindrical solenoid with a consistently colored central region and a numeric scale, which matches the speaker's description of a strong, uniform field in the middle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

    "model_answer": "The speaker implies that adjusting N (number of turns), I (current), and L (length) can be used to control the magnetic field inside the solenoid, as indicated by the equation B_inside = (μ₀ N I)/L on the slide. This means that increasing the number of turns (N), the current (I), or decreasing the length (L) will increase the strength of the magnetic field within the solenoid.",

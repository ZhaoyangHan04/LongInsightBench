    "model_answer": "The balance between evaporation and condensation is depicted by the simultaneous presence of the upward “Evaporation Rate” arrow and the downward “Condensation Rate” arrow in the given time interval, as well as the fact that the thermometer indicates a high temperature. The speaker suggests that the high temperature drives evaporation until it balances condensation. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

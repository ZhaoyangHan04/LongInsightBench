    "model_answer": "The arrow labeled “V” is drawn tangential to the circle because it represents the object’s tangential velocity, which is aligned with the direction of motion as the speaker describes (00:01:07.589). This means that the velocity vector is perpendicular to the radius vector of the circular path. Option A correctly explains this concept.\n\nOption B is incorrect because centripetal acceleration always points towards the center of the circle, not tangential velocity.\n\nOption C is incorrect because angular frequency (ω) represents the number of radians completed in one second, not the direction of motion.\n\nOption D is partially correct, as the angle used to measure circumference may be measured counterclockwise from a chosen reference direction, but the arrow “V” does not indicate this direction. The primary purpose of the arrow “V” is to show that it is related to tangential velocity, not the method of measuring circumference.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: It represents the object’s tangential velocity, drawn tangentially because velocity aligns with the direction of motion as the speaker describes.",

    "model_answer": "The conclusion that the rotating cylinder's period is about 63 seconds (≈ one revolution per minute) is reached, and it is supported by the visual representation of the cylinder rotating at a constant velocity of 100 m/s on the screen. We can calculate the period using the formula T = 2πr/v, where r is the radius of the cylinder and v is its velocity. Substituting the given values, we get T = 2π * r / 100 m/s ≈ 63.3 seconds. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: It specifies the curve’s radius needed to compute the centripetal acceleration for a no-slip speed, consistent with his explanation that friction provides the inward force.\n\nIn the provided excerpt, the instructor writes 'r = 57 m' on the board, which implies that he is calculating the radius of curvature necessary for a car to maintain a constant velocity without slipping. This calculation is crucial for determining the appropriate safe speed for driving on curves, as excessive speed can lead to loss of traction and potential accidents. The value of '57 m' likely refers to the radius at which the car should be driven at a safe, constant speed to avoid skidding or losing control.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: They sum to zero because the car is not accelerating vertically, which is reflected by the equation N − mg = 0 on the board.\nSupporting evidence from the screen shot shows the equation N - mg = 0 written on the board, which indicates that the normal force (N) and weight (mg) of the car must sum to zero in the vertical direction since the car is not accelerating vertically.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: x2′ gains an additional −k x2 term, where k is identified as the friction parameter.\n\nIn the provided excerpt, the speaker mentions that after introducing the pendulum system on wheels, there is an additional term due to friction. This term is added to the equation for x2', which represents the second pendulum's displacement. The coefficient k represents the friction parameter, indicating the strength of the friction force acting on the system.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: To allow slight platform motion that lets the dominant pendulum influence the platform, leading to anti-phase synchronization.\nBy placing the wooden platform on rollers, the builder creates a system of pendulums where the motion of one pendulum can affect the motion of the others. This is because the platform, being on wheels, can move slightly, which allows the dominant pendulum to influence the platform's motion. As a result, the pendula will synchronize their movements in anti-phase, meaning that they will swing in opposite directions at the same time.\nTherefore, the purpose of using rollers in this setup is to create a system where the pendula can synchronize their movements through the interaction of the platform's motion with the dominant pendulum.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because the speaker verbally says the voltage is about 25.5 volts, but the on-screen measurement and overlay indicate the reading is actually 25.5 millivolts.\nIn the video, the speaker mentions that the measured voltage is around 25.5 volts, which is close to the expected value of around 25.6 volts. However, when the measurement is displayed on the screen, it shows 25.5 millivolts. This discrepancy is explained by the fact that the measurement was taken using a digital multimeter, which displays the voltage in millivolts rather than volts. Therefore, the text overlay is necessary to clarify the actual units being displayed.",

    "model_answer": "The setup for temperature monitoring in the time frame from 00:01:18.337 to 00:01:51.085 involves inserting a thin Germanium crystal with a smooth surface into the center of the four-probe arrangement. A digital voltmeter is used to monitor the voltage across the crystal. To calibrate the probe spacing, a red arrow indicates where the probe should be positioned. Once everything is set up, a constant current source is turned on to heat the oven (option C). The power supply for the oven is connected through a black cable (option B).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: The oven is connected to the power supply via a black cable, causing it to power on.",

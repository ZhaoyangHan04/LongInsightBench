    "model_answer": "The change in visual content from whiteboard diagrams to a jar of peanut butter with a green ball inside is likely done to provide a more intuitive and relatable explanation for the concept of frame-dragging around a rotating black hole. The green ball represents the rotating mass of the black hole, while the peanut butter illustrates how this rotation drags space-time around it, making objects fall towards the singularity faster than light. This helps viewers grasp the complex idea of frame-dragging without getting lost in technical jargon. Therefore, the correct answer would be A: To provide a tangible analogy for frame-dragging around a rotating (Kerr) black holeâ€”the green ball stands in for the core while the peanut butter illustrates how rotation drags the surrounding region.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Their clock appears to run slower and their emitted light is gravitationally redshifted. As an object approaches the event horizon of a black hole, the gravitational field becomes stronger and stronger. This causes time dilation, meaning that time appears to move slower for the infalling object compared to someone far away from the black hole. Additionally, as light travels towards a black hole, it has to travel through a stronger gravitational field, which causes it to be redshifted. So, both the time experienced by the infalling person and the frequency of their emitted light will be lower than those of someone far away from the black hole.",

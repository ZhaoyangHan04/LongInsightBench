    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: The black-and-white photograph and chalkboard work connect to the speakerâ€™s mention of Heisenberg and the development of the uncertainty principle.\n\nThe use of the black-and-white photograph and chalkboard is likely to emphasize the concept of uncertainty, which is central to quantum mechanics. This visual aid helps illustrate the idea that in the quantum world, it is impossible to know both the position and velocity of a particle simultaneously, as stated by the uncertainty principle. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",

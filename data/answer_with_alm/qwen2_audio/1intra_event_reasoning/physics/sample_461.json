    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because most alpha particles passed through the gold foil with only some scattered, inconsistent with a solid or uniformly positive mass and indicating a small, concentrated positive center.\n\nThe Gold Foil Experiment conducted by Ernest Rutherford in 1909 involved shooting alpha particles at a thin gold foil. Most of the alpha particles passed through the foil unimpeded, while a few were deflected, suggesting that the atom has a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by a much larger cloud of negatively charged electrons. This observation contradicted the earlier plum pudding model of the atom, which proposed that the atom was a uniform, positively charged sphere. The result led to the development of the modern atomic model, which postulates that atoms are composed of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, with electrons orbiting around them.",

    "model_answer": "The red wavy line emitted from the green dot on the n = 2 orbit signifies that an electron has made a transition from n = 2 to n = 1, emitting a photon of energy hν. This process corresponds to the spectral lines observed in hydrogen, which is known as the Balmer series. Therefore, the correct answer is A: It represents photon emission equal to ΔE = hv during an electron jump to n = 1, and these transitions correspond to the spectral lines observed in hydrogen. The speaker draws the conclusion that the Balmer series is a result of transitions between different energy levels of hydrogen's electron.",

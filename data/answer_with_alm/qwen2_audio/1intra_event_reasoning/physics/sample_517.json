    "model_answer": "The segment demonstrates that both peak acceleration and its duration are crucial in assessing head injury risk by stating that the Head Injury Criteria (HIC) formula incorporates both magnitude and duration of acceleration. This is evident from the screen display showing the HIC formula and the graph that plots acceleration over time. The speaker also explicitly mentions that both peak acceleration and duration are important for safety calculations. Therefore, the correct answer is A: The speaker explicitly says that peak acceleration and its duration are important in the safety calculations.",

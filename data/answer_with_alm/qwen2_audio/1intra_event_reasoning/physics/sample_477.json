    "model_answer": "The scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry and Mines generate the extreme conditions required to study superconductivity by using the diamond-anvil cell, which consists of two diamond anvils that are used to compress a small sample. The diamonds are so hard that they can withstand the high pressures needed to create superconductivity. Therefore, the correct answer is B: They use the diamond-headed components shown to compress an H2S-containing sample inside a diamond anvil cell.",

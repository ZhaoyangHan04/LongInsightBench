    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Because adding or removing load makes the experimental wire elongate or contract and displace the bubble; waiting allows the wire to fully extend or contract before re-leveling.\nExplanation: When the load on the wire changes, it causes the wire to either stretch or compress. This displacement of the bubble from the center of the spirit level indicates that the level must be re-leveled. Adjustments should only be made after a sufficient time gap to allow the wire to return to its original state, ensuring accurate measurements.",

The mean extension for a 2 kg load can be determined by taking the average of the values in the last column labeled “Extension for 2 kg load”, which gives 1.18 mm (also shown as 0.118 cm).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

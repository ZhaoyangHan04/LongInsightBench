To calculate the phase difference between two interfering waves, we use the formula Δφ = (2π/λ)Δl, where Δl is the path difference between the two waves and λ is their wavelength. In this case, the speaker substitutes Δl with y·d/d, which represents the path difference between the two waves as they travel along the waveguide in the x-direction. This gives us Δφ = (2π/λ)(y·d/d).",

Option C best fits this description as it mentions the speaker saying 'thank you' and the slide demonstrating the effect of closing one slit on the interference pattern.",

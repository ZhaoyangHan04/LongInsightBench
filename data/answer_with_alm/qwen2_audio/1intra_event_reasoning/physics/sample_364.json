    "model_answer": "The conclusion drawn about an isolated neutron after 15 minutes, as indicated by both the decay visuals and the narration, is that there is a 50% chance it has decayed into a proton, an electron, and an anti-electron neutrino, reflecting its half-life. This means that after 15 minutes, there is a 50% chance that the neutron has undergone radioactive decay, emitting a gamma ray and transforming into three other particles. The other options are not supported by the given information.",

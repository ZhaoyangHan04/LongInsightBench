    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: To simplify the equations into a single time-independent constant expression.\n\nThe instructor writes and points to derivatives like d^2x/dt^2 alongside expressions such as A cos(ωt) on the whiteboard to simplify the equations into a single time-independent constant expression. This is typically done in physics when analyzing harmonic motion, where the equations become much easier to understand and solve if they are simplified. The derivative of d^2x/dt^2 represents the acceleration of the system, while the cosine term represents the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation. By combining these terms, the instructor can show how the motion can be described by a single constant value, which makes the analysis much simpler.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: He is showing two valid mathematical representations of displacement in SHM that align with the theoretical definition he mentions.\n\nIn the provided time interval, the instructor is discussing simple harmonic motion (SHM). In physics, simple harmonic motion is described by a sinusoidal function where the displacement of a particle from its equilibrium position is proportional to the sine or cosine of the angular frequency multiplied by the time. Therefore, the instructor writes both x = A sin(ωt) and x = A cos(ωt) on the board to show that these two equations represent different forms of displacement in SHM, all equivalent to the same physical phenomenon.",

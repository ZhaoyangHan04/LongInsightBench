    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: By adjusting the three thumbscrews so a slightly curved glass and a flat glass inside the housing make the right contact, then bringing the assembly into the light to reveal the rings.\n\nIn the provided video, the experimenter adjusts the screws on a device to create Newton's Rings. The curvature of the convex lens causes thin films of air to form between the lens and a flat glass plate when light passes through. These thin films reflect different colors, creating the rainbow-like rings that are characteristic of Newton's Rings. When the assembly is brought into the light, these rings become visible.",

    "model_answer": "A: The rings are shown first with white (warm/yellowish) light, then under various colored lights including green, blue, and red, ending in blue; the narrator notes the rings appear smaller with different colors and that in a half white/half laser image the laser-lit rings line up with the white-light rings.\n\nThe narrator describes how the rings appear when illuminated by white light, and then contrasts this with the appearance of the same rings under different colored lasers. They note that the rings appear smaller when illuminated by different colors and that, in a half-white/half-laser image, the laser-lit rings align with the white-light rings. This suggests that the size of the rings is affected by the color of the light they are illuminated by.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: The rings are shown first with white (warm/yellowish) light, then under various colored lights including green, blue, and red, ending in blue; the narrator notes the rings appear smaller with different colors and that in a half white/half laser image the laser-lit rings line up with the white-light rings.",

In the reconfigured setup, the masses of the truck and plane are interchanged, with the truck now being supported by the plane. The strings and pulleys are used to replace the gravitational force between the two objects. Therefore, option A is the correct answer: the masses are now mL = 0.270 kg and mR = 0.465 kg, and the plane is needed to support the truck.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

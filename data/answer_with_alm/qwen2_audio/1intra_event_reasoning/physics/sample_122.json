    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: A 10 kg block is pulled with 20 N vertically upward; the board shows ‘θ = 90°’ and ‘f = 0’.\n\nIn the provided audio clip, the presenter describes a scenario where a box with a mass of 10 kilograms is being pulled by 20 newtons at a 30-degree angle on a surface. The presenter then mentions that they will show how to solve this problem using basic steps. This indicates that the setup involves a force acting vertically upwards on the box, as shown in option D, and the board markings likely involve the angle of force (30 degrees) and the force itself (20 newtons).",

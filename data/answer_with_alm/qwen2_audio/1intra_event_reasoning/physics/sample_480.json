    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Because ΔT is taken from final to initial here, making ΔT negative for a cooling step; the slide also states heat must be removed.\nIn this case, the energy is calculated based on the change in temperature between the initial and final state of the system. Since the temperature decreases during the cooling process, the change in temperature (ΔT) is negative. Therefore, the energy transfer (q) is also negative, indicating that heat is being removed from the system. This is consistent with the principle that heat always flows from hotter bodies to cooler bodies.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Because the specific heat displayed is in J/(mol·K), so the amount must be in moles and the temperature change must be in Kelvin to match the units.\n\nThe presenter converts grams to moles and Celsius to Kelvin because the specific heat capacity value provided is in units of J/(mol·K). This means that when calculating the heat absorbed or released by the system, the mass of the tungsten block needs to be converted to moles, and the temperature change needs to be expressed in Kelvin. The conversion from Celsius to Kelvin is also necessary because the final temperature of the tungsten block is specified in Kelvin.",

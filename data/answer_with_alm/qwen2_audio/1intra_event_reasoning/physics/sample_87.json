    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: He explains that while the driver is reacting (thinking), the car keeps moving at the same speed for a time t, so the distance covered in that interval is speed v times time t.\n\nIn the provided excerpt, the speaker justifies the formula d = v Ã— t by giving an example of how it relates to real-life situations, such as driving. When a driver sees something ahead and needs to brake, their thought process involves processing the information and reacting quickly, which takes some time. During this reaction time, the car continues to move forward at a constant speed, covering a certain distance. Therefore, the distance covered during this reaction time is equal to the car's speed multiplied by the reaction time.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because while describing reacting to a cat and then braking, he uses the graph to show that total stopping distance is the sum of the distance covered during the reaction (thinking) phase and the distance covered while decelerating (braking).\n\nIn the provided excerpt, the presenter is illustrating how friction affects vehicle motion by using an example of driving and encountering a cat. The graph helps visualize the relationship between the car's speed and the time it takes to stop due to frictional forces acting on the wheels. The equation \"STOPPING DISTANCE = Thinking Distance + Braking Distance\" emphasizes that the total stopping distance is the combination of the time taken for the driver to react to the situation ('Thinking Distance') and the distance traveled while decelerating ('Braking Distance'). This helps drivers understand that proper anticipation and timely application of brakes are crucial for safe stopping.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: By first finding Ig from the number of divisions and figure of merit (Ig = nK), then computing R = V/Ig − G, and finally connecting a resistance box in series with the galvanometer to realize the desired range.\n\nThe tutorial explains that to convert the galvanometer into a voltmeter of a desired range, we need to find the equivalent resistance (R) of the galvanometer by calculating R = V/Ig − G, where V is the applied voltage, Ig is the sensitivity of the galvanometer (which can be found from its number of divisions and figure of merit), and G is the internal resistance of the galvanometer. Once we have calculated R, we can connect a resistance box in series with the galvanometer to realize the desired range. This is because the resistance of the resistance box will effectively set the overall resistance seen by the galvanometer, allowing us to measure voltage over a wider range.",

    "model_answer": "The error between the converted voltmeter and a standard voltmeter during verification can be obtained by noting the standard voltmeter and the galvanometer readings, converting the galvanometer’s deflection to a voltmeter reading, and taking their difference. This method involves measuring both the standard voltmeter and the galvanometer's readings under the same conditions and then calculating the difference between them. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

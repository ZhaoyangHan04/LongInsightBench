    "model_answer": "The speaker concludes the initial single-crystal model is insufficient because the theoretical strength is five times higher than the experimental value, as stated in option B. This discrepancy is reinforced by the diagram that shows 'Strength, theoretical 5x more than experimental.'",

    "model_answer": "B: He stresses that imperfections are hugely important for achieving desired properties and mentions a specific type, dislocation, to be explored later; the lattice is annotated with 'crystalline' and 'imperfection' to highlight a defect.\n\nThe narrator introduces 'crystalline imperfection' because it is crucial for understanding the behavior of materials under different conditions. The term 'crystalline' refers to a material's periodic arrangement of atoms in a crystal structure, while 'imperfection' indicates any deviation from this idealized structure. By discussing crystalline imperfections, the narrator sets the stage for explaining the role of dislocations, which are defects in the crystal lattice that play a significant role in material properties such as strength and ductility.",

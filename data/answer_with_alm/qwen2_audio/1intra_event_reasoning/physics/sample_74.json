    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because there are no magnetic monopoles, and as shown by the N-S magnet diagram the field lines leaving the surface are balanced by those entering, giving zero net flux.\n\nIn option B, the statement about electric flux being zero is incorrect because it does not apply to this scenario. In option C, the statement is only partially correct because while the north pole lies inside the surface, the south pole also lies outside the surface, but the contribution from the south pole is canceled out by the north pole due to symmetry. In option D, the statement is incorrect because the magnet does have field lines inside it, and they do cross the surface.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The yellow field lines are shown looping so that entries and exits through the gray circle balance, while the speaker explicitly states the net flux is still zero in this case.\nIn order for the net magnetic flux through a closed surface to be zero, the number of field lines entering and exiting the surface must be equal. In the given scenario, the field lines are looping around the gray surface in such a way that they enter and exit through the surface in equal numbers, ensuring that the net flux remains zero.",

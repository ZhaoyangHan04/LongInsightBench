    "model_answer": "Answer: A: He sets the normal reaction to zero so that mg cosθ equals qB·u, and uses the work–energy theorem noting that only gravity does work along the sliding distance because magnetic force and the normal are perpendicular to the displacement.\n\nThe presenter first finds the frictional force between the particle and the incline using the formula f = μN, where μ is the coefficient of friction and N is the normal reaction force. Since the normal reaction force is set to zero, the frictional force becomes equal to the magnetic force acting on the particle, which is given by qB. The magnitude of the magnetic force is proportional to the charge q and the strength of the magnetic field B, and the direction is perpendicular to both the velocity u and the magnetic field. Therefore, the work done by the magnetic force on the particle is given by qB·u in the direction of motion.\n\nUsing the work-energy theorem, the presenter notes that only the gravitational force does work along the sliding distance, since the magnetic force and the normal are perpendicular to the displacement. This means that the total work done on the particle is zero, and the kinetic energy gained by the particle is equal to the potential energy lost due to the gravitational force. Therefore, the speed at which",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: By switching to a frame moving rightwards so that the transformed electric field cancels gravity (qE = mg), leaving uniform circular motion under the magnetic field.\n\nIn this scenario, the particle starts moving down an incline under the influence of both gravity and a magnetic field. When it reaches the bottom, it continues moving along a horizontal path. To achieve circular motion, we need to change our reference frame so that the vertical component of gravity (mg) is canceled by the electric field (qE). In a frame moving rightward at a speed v, the electric field becomes qEv/m, which cancels the vertical component of gravity when mvr = mg. This results in uniform circular motion in the horizontal plane under the action of only the magnetic force.\n\nOption B is incorrect because increasing the magnetic field does not change the direction of the motion. Option C is incorrect because the component of gravity along the surface remains unchanged when the incline is reoriented. Option D is incorrect because turning off the magnetic field would eliminate the circular motion altogether.",

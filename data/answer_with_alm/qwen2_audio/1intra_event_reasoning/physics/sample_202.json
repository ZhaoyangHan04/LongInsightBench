    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Because the resultant reaction reaches its maximum inclination at impending motion (Fmax = μs N), and she calls it the angle of static friction.\n\nIn the provided excerpt, the presenter explains that when there is no motion (μk = 0), the angle of kinetic friction becomes equal to the angle of static friction (tan φ = μs). This occurs because the maximum force that can be developed in response to an external force is proportional to the coefficient of static friction (μs) and the normal force acting on the surface. When the external force becomes large enough to cause motion, the maximum force that can be developed increases as well, until it reaches the value of μsN, which is the maximum value of the static friction force. At this point, the angle of static friction also becomes maximum, and it is called the angle of static friction.",

    "model_answer": "The conclusion being illustrated is that bringing attractive particles together raises potential energy and increases mass, as supported by the visual representation of two blue spheres labeled \"Potential Energy\" and the equation E=mc^2 mentioned in the narration. This aligns with option C.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: The bound nucleus has a greater mass than the separated nucleons. \n\nThis can be inferred from the fact that the scale is labeled \"Nuclear Scale,\" which implies it is used to compare the masses of atomic nuclei. Additionally, the narration states that the scale shows a bound nucleus on one side and its separated nucleons on the other, and the fact that the bound nucleus tips towards the heavier side indicates that it has a greater mass than the separated nucleons.",

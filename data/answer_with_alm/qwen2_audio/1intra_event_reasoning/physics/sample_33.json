    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Because the narrator argues that to address humanity’s failures we need a new perspective grounded in natural patterns and the picture of spacetime, culminating in asking “What is time?”. The speech transitions from discussing global issues like poverty and climate change to broader philosophical and scientific concepts like evolution, quantum mechanics, and gravity, suggesting a shift in focus from practical solutions to understanding the underlying nature of reality itself.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: The “hologram @NOW” annotation aligns with the speaker’s references to a black hole hologram and the “surrounding coherent now,” indicating present-slice surface encoding of information.\nIn the provided excerpt, the speaker describes the concept of black holes using visual aids such as a cube labeled L^2 with radiating arrows, a red spiral, the “hologram @NOW” marker, the “horizon” arrow with a red wavy boundary, and small cubes labeled Φ, mc^2, and hf. These visual aids help convey complex scientific concepts in a more accessible way. The “hologram @NOW” annotation specifically aligns with the speaker's discussion of black hole holograms and the idea that information about the black hole is encoded on its event horizon in a present-slice surface form. This helps illustrate the concept of holographic entropy and the idea that information cannot be destroyed in a black hole.",

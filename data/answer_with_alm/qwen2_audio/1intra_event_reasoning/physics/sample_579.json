The presenter explains that in the calculation of braking time, the negative sign indicates that the car slows down, so he cancels them and gets 1.5 seconds. However, this is a simplified example, and in real life, there are other factors to consider such as the mass of the car, which affects the duration of braking. Therefore, option D seems like the most appropriate answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

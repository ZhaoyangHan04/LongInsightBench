    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because opening/unlocking the instrument door triggers an alarm state while the door is open.\nIn the provided time frame, the Alarm light illuminates immediately after the green \"Open Door\" button is pressed. This indicates that the activation of the Open Door button causes the Alarm light to turn on. The reason for this could be that the alarm system is designed to remain deactivated until the instrument door is closed, and opening the door activates the alarm. Once the door is closed, the alarm should return to its normal state.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Pressing Start opens the X-ray shutter and the goniometer moves to its starting theta and two-theta positions.\n\nExplanation: In the provided time frame, after the initial button press, the actions that occur in order to initiate a scan are as follows:\n\n1. A new window opens where the user can add a sample ID, select a parameter file, and choose a save location.\n2. Once the user has configured these settings, pressing the Start button initiates the scan by opening the X-ray shutter and moving the goniometer to its starting theta and two-theta positions.\n3. As soon as the X-ray source starts, the busy light turns off to indicate that the scan has begun.\n\nTherefore, option B accurately describes the sequence of events that confirm the initiation of a scan on this instrument.",

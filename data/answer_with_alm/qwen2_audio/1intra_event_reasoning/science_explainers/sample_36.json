    "model_answer": "Answer: A: It visualizes a shared barycenter between two bodies, reinforcing the point that Pluto and Charon orbit a common centerâ€”implying two Jupiter-sized bodies doing the same might also fail the planet criterion.\nThe two-dot diagram in the speech illustrates the concept of a shared barycenter between Pluto and its largest moon Charon. This shared center helps us understand that Pluto and Charon do not qualify as a single, distinct celestial body under the current planetary definition. The speaker uses this example to support his argument that if two large celestial bodies like Pluto and Charon share a common center of mass, they should not be considered separate planets.",

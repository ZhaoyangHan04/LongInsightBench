    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: One side of the object could be darker (Iapetus-like), so its changing orientation alters how bright it appears.\nIn the provided clip, the speaker explains that the brightness variability of the object is not due to its unique shape but rather because one side of the object resembles the moon Iapetus, which has a dark trailing region on its leading side. Therefore, as the object's orientation changes relative to Earth, the side that faces us may appear brighter or darker depending on its position in relation to sunlight.",

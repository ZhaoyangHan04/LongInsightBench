    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because the helicopter visually lags behind the moving truck after takeoff, the presenter argues objects do not keep their carrier’s horizontal motion, so Earth cannot be spinning.\n\nIn the video, the presenter demonstrates an experiment where a small helicopter is launched off the back of a moving truck. After the helicopter takes off, it is observed to lag behind the truck. This observation leads the presenter to conclude that objects do not maintain their carrier's horizontal motion, which implies that Earth cannot be rotating. The other options do not logically follow from the given evidence in the video.",

The diagram provides context on the solar system, and the subsequent display of hammer throw clips could be used to compare the motion of the Earth and hammer around their respective barycenters.",

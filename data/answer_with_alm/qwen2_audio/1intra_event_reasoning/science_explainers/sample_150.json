    "model_answer": "The reason for the narration's jump is likely option B: To draw an analogy that even a small leftover problem (like the 0.1% bacteria) motivates hands-free interaction, foreshadowing BCIs that avoid touching devices. This connection between the cleanliness of surfaces and the need for hands-free technology aligns with the development of brain-computer interface research funded by the Department of Defense, which aims to create more efficient and intuitive human-computer interactions. The mention of Dettol and the visual of a person using a smartphone could be seen as a marketing tactic to promote the product's relevance to the topic without being directly sponsored content.",

    "model_answer": "The segment conveys both how Neuralink reads brain activity and how it is implanted through a combination of visual aids and narration. It starts by explaining that neurons' electrical activity creates fields that can be translated into code using computer software (Option A). This is accompanied by footage of neuron imagery to help illustrate this concept. The segment then moves on to describe the implantation process, stating that many tiny \"hairs\" are inserted into the brain quickly and without major surgery (Option B). This is further reinforced by visualizations of the procedure and comments from Dr. Hawking about the ease of the手术. Therefore, the correct answer would be A: By explaining that neurons’ electrical activity creates fields that can be translated into code while showing neuron imagery, and by stating that many tiny “hairs” are inserted quickly without major surgery as lab and surgical visuals appear.",

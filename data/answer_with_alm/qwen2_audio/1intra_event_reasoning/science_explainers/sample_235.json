    "model_answer": "The sequence implies that engineers observed the kingfisher's unique beak shape and used it as inspiration for designing a more aerodynamic train nose, which would reduce air compression noise in tunnels and potentially lead to improved speed and energy efficiency. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Engineers reshaped the train’s nose based on the kingfisher’s beak to reduce tunnel noise from air compression, which also yielded power savings and higher speed.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: The split-screen of seed pods and Velcro visually reinforces the natural model behind the fastener’s texture.\n\nThe visuals in the clip show seed pods that are similar in shape and texture to Velcro, reinforcing the idea that Velcro's design was inspired by nature. Additionally, the narrator mentions that the inventor of Velcro, George de Mestral, observed spiky plant seeds sticking to his dog's fur during a walk, which inspired him to create a fastener with similar properties.\n\nTherefore, option A is partially correct because the narrator does mention the inspiration behind Velcro's design, but option B provides a clearer picture of how the visuals support the narration. Options C and D are incorrect because they either describe an unrelated aspect of Velcro or suggest a specific application that is not supported by the clip.",

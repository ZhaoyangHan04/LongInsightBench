    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: By striking the bag repeatedly with consistent timing as its arc increases, demonstrating resonance.\n\nIn the provided excerpt, the presenter explains that resonance occurs when a system responds to a driving force in a way that the frequency of the driving force is matched by a natural frequency of the system. In this case, the punching bag's swing grows larger due to the repetitive strikes on the bag at a consistent pace, which causes the bag to resonate. This concept is often demonstrated in physics classes using simple systems like pendulums or springs.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer would be A: The spark gap allows the charged capacitor to release a sudden pulse of energy into the big primary coil.\n\nIn the provided time frame, the speech mentions that after the switch is turned on, there's a brief moment of silence (00:05:43.697 to 00:05:46.807), followed by a sudden energy pulse being delivered to the primary coil (00:05:46.807 to 00:06:11.469). This indicates that a spark gap is used to allow the charged capacitor to release its stored energy as a sudden pulse into the primary coil.",

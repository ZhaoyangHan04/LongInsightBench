    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Because Earth's counterclockwise revolution around the sun causes a daily east-to-west track. \n\nAs Earth rotates on its axis, different parts of it face towards or away from the Sun, causing changes in the direction of light and shadow. The rotation takes about 24 hours to complete, which is why we see the Sun move across the sky from east to west each day. This apparent east-to-west motion of the Sun is caused by the rotation of Earth on its axis.",

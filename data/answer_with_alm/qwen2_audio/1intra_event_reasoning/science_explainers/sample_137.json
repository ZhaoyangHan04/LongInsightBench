    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on earth sciences for help. A combination of evidence such as the narrator's explanation about the glacier sitting in a tectonic trench with a thinner crust and faults that let more heat escape, along with on-screen studies and maps highlighting a high-heat area beneath Thwaites, provides a comprehensive understanding of why a lot of heat is detected beneath the Thwaites Glacier.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer would be A: The narrator cites high concentrations of a specific helium isotope as evidence of active volcanism beneath the ice. This implies that the presence of certain isotopes in the ice can indicate past or current volcanic activity, which contributes to the melting of Pine Island Glacier. The other options either do not specifically mention the contribution of volcanism to the melting of Pine Island Glacier or do not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim.",

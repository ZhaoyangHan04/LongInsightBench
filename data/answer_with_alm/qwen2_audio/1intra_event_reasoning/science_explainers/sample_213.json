    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Because as φ rotates, atoms get too close—shown by yellow/red clash markers and a “Clash!” inset—indicating steric clashes that make those φ values impossible at ψ = 165°.\nThe Phi angle is important in determining the secondary structure of proteins. It describes the local conformation of the backbone amide groups around the alpha-carbon. When Psi is fixed at 165 degrees, it creates a specific hydrogen bonding pattern. However, as φ rotates, the atoms in the protein can get too close to each other, leading to steric clashes which makes certain φ values impossible. This is shown in the yellow-red clash markers in the figure provided in the audio. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "Option A provides the most support for the conclusion that φ = 0° is physically impossible. The speaker directly observed clashes between atoms when setting φ to 0°, and the plot confirms these clashes occur across the entire ψ sweep for φ = 0°. This evidence contradicts the assumption that φ = 0° is common in proteins and implies it is not a feasible conformation.",

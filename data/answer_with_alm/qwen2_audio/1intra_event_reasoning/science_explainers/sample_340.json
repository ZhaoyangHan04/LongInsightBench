    "model_answer": "The mechanism described for creating the pattern on a wafer between 00:04:01.647 and 00:04:41.548 is using a focused optical beam, which directly writes the circuitry without intermediates. This is supported by the man in the light blue shirt describing the process next to equipment in the video. Therefore, the correct answer is D: A focused optical beam directly writes the circuitry without intermediates.",

    "model_answer": "Option A: Itâ€™s roughly the size of a bus and would require three cargo planes to ship, as said while the ASML-branded tool dominates the cleanroom bay.\n\nThe size of the lithography tool mentioned in the audio indicates that it is quite large, almost the size of a bus. This makes it difficult to move using conventional means, such as trucks or trains. Therefore, shipping it would require specialized transportation methods like cargo planes, which can carry large and bulky items. Additionally, since the cleanroom is designed to maintain a high level of purity, any contamination from the outside world must be minimized. Moving such a large and sensitive piece of equipment into and out of the cleanroom without disturbing the environment requires careful planning and execution, making it a complex logistics challenge.",

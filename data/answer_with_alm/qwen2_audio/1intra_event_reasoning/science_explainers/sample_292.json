    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Plants first pull CO2 from the air as they grow; the biomass is then used to make biofuel, and the remaining carbon is captured and stored underground or put into products like concrete.\n\nThis process works because plants absorb CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis as they grow. The biomass produced from these plants can then be used to make biofuels such as ethanol or biodiesel. The carbon stored in the biomass remains sequestered underground or is incorporated into products like concrete, effectively removing it from the atmosphere. This method of producing fuel reduces our reliance on fossil fuels and helps mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on climate change for help. The direct air capture (DAC) technology is presented as expensive when compared to capturing CO2 at power plants ($60 per ton versus $94-$232 per ton). Also, it is noted that DAC is similar to other carbon capture technologies but requires more energy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

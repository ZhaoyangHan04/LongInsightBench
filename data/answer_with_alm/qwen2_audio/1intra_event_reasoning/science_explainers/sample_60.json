    "model_answer": "Answer: C: Because they fail to ignite and remain intact even after attempted lighting.\n\nThe support for this answer comes from the description of the Canadian Fire Cracklers in the video. The speaker states that they are the \"lamest\" firecrackers because they don't ignite and remain intact even after being lit. This indicates that they fail to produce the desired effect of burning and creating a loud bang, which are typical characteristics of successful firecrackers.",

This is highlighted through the use of web page bullets and an animation that contrasts these chemical cocktails with iPSCs created through genetic reprogramming, which involves losing cellular identity. The animation shows the process of reprogramming cells into iPSCs, emphasizing the difference between the two approaches.",

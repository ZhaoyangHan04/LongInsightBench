    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Insulin, IGF-1, and mechanical muscle stimuli are identified as inhibiting autophagy. This is reinforced visually by the screen first listing these factors explicitly and then showing a pathway diagram toward mTOR/p70S6K and muscle protein synthesis, which contrasts with the normal process of autophagy.\n\nInsulin, IGF-1, and mechanical muscle stimuli are known to interfere with the process of autophagy. They can lead to increased levels of mTOR, which hinders the degradation of cellular debris and dysfunctional organelles through self-eating. The visual representation in the video helps to emphasize the role of these factors in inhibiting autophagy by contrasting their effects on the normal pathway of autophagy with the diagram showing mTOR activation and muscle protein synthesis.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. The graph shows that after eating, there's a sharp increase in insulin due to carbohydrates. This increase is then followed by a smaller but consistent rise in insulin due to fat. As a result, insulin levels remain elevated for longer, making the body less likely to engage in autophagy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

The article states that AESA beam deflection has limited the antenna's sensitivity and the advantage is considered gone when the angle reaches around 45 degrees. Therefore, option A is the correct answer as it mentions the same limitation and consequence of beam deflection.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

    "model_answer": "The sequence is likely designed to visually represent the concept of compounds formed from combining atoms, aligning the imagery of a cup and saucer with the liquid sound to represent a solidified compound like coffee, and the liquid sound with the liquid itself. This format helps in making complex scientific concepts more accessible and engaging for the audience. Therefore, the correct answer would be A.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are A, C, and D.\nThe zoom-ins on Li, Be, Na, and Mg show the filling of their respective electron shells, which supports the periodic table's arrangement based on electron configurations. The diagrams also reveal that each period has a similar pattern of electron configurations, indicating a recurring trend in outer-electron arrangements across periods. Additionally, the final side-by-side comparison of Li and Na's electron configurations confirms that they share similar properties due to their similar electron configurations, aligning with sodium's position in the periodic table. Therefore, these visual aids help illustrate why the table is periodic and reinforce the narrator's explanation.",

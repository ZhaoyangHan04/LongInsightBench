    "model_answer": "The correct answer would be A: To visually represent solitons that the speaker says form in nature and may help explain what holds things together.\n\nThe scene in the audio where the person blows smoke rings and the camera lingers on a glowing circular shape is likely meant to demonstrate the concept of solitons. Solitons are stable, localized disturbances in physical systems such as water waves, electrical currents, and gravitational waves. The speaker suggests that these solitary waves could hold the key to understanding the forces that govern the universe. By blowing smoke rings, the speaker may be illustrating how solitons appear visually and capturing the viewer's attention to explore this concept further.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: He is modeling electrostatic attraction between opposite charges using the band to represent the force.\n\nIn the provided excerpt, the man is explaining the concept of electrostatics by tying two marbles with a rubber band and then pulling them apart. This demonstration illustrates that when two objects with opposite charges come close to each other, they are attracted to each other due to the electrostatic force. The rubber band represents the elastic force that opposes the separation of the charged marbles.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: To show the universe expanding into empty space so that flat surfaces curl up into spheres as they grow.\nThe audio clip shows a visual representation of the concept of the universe expanding into empty space, which causes flat surfaces like a green board to curl up into spheres. This is often depicted in cosmology as part of the Big Bang theory. The twisting motion of the board illustrates how the universe's expansion stretches and warps space-time, causing objects to appear distorted.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: He connects a wire to the blue POWER SONIC battery to create the spark, then pulls the wire off and removes the battery to stop it.\n\nExplanation: The sound of crackling and sparks in the audio indicates an electrical discharge. In option A, the person connects a wire to a battery, which creates a spark when the positive and negative terminals touch. After creating the spark, they quickly pull the wire away from the battery to stop the discharge. This stops the crackling and sparks from continuing. Option B involves scraping a wire against metal nuts, which does not produce the same type of electrical discharge as connecting a wire to a battery. Option C involves tapping nuts together, which also does not produce the same type of electrical discharge. Option D involves touching two wires directly without a battery, which will not produce any electrical discharge at all.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: He is checking for a magnetic field with a Gauss meter and nudging the pieces with a pencil during the measurement to see if the device reacts.\n\nThe description in the audio indicates that the presenter is moving a black device around a cluster of nuts and bolts while prodding them with a pencil. This suggests that he is trying to measure something, possibly a magnetic field, using a Gauss meter. The fact that he is moving the device and probing it with the pencil implies that he is actively seeking to detect any changes in the magnetic field strength caused by the interaction between the device and the nuts and bolts.",

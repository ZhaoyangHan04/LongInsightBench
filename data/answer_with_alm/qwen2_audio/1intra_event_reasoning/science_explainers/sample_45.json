    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: To humorously bridge the everyday idea of “feeling big” after eating with the far greater scale of cosmic objects, setting up the question of what the biggest things are.\n\nThe video starts by drawing a parallel between a person's sense of size after eating a family-sized bag of chips or a long subway ride and the size of some of the largest objects in our universe. This creates a humorous and relatable starting point for discussing the topic of the largest objects in the universe. By juxtaposing these two scenarios, the video piques the audience's interest and sets up the following discussion about the relative sizes of humans and the cosmos.",

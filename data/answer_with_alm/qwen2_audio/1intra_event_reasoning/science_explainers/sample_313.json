    "model_answer": "The sequence moves from a meditating figure to a magnetic field diagram, then an iceberg, and finally to a cityscape being shown on a projector screen likely because each element represents a different aspect of our physical and metaphorical environment. The meditating figure symbolizes introspection and connection to the内心 world, the magnetic field diagram represents the unseen forces that shape our world, the iceberg represents the fragility of our planet's natural wonders, and the cityscape represents the impact of human activity on the environment. Together, these elements illustrate how our perception and understanding of reality evolve, starting from a personal and internal perspective and expanding to include the external world around us. Therefore, option A seems like the most appropriate answer as it aligns with the idea of interconnectedness and the progression from individual to collective understanding.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: By using the poo-and-flies example to show that what we look for shapes what we find—echoing Heisenberg’s view that reality is defined by our method of questioning—then segueing to the double-slit as an experiment framed by the questions we ask of nature. \n\nThe speaker starts by illustrating how our perception and understanding of the world are shaped by the tools and methods we use to observe it. This is similar to Heisenberg's famous uncertainty principle, which states that the act of observing a particle changes its properties. The speaker then introduces the double-slit experiment as a demonstration of this concept, where the interference pattern observed depends on the questions asked about the particles passing through the slits. This emphasizes the role of experimental design and methodology in shaping scientific understanding.",

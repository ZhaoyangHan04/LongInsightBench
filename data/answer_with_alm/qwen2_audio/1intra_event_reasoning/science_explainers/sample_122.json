    "model_answer": "The narrator explains that when ACV is mixed with oil, it creates a cloudy substance because the ACV breaks down the oil molecules. This indicates that ACV has some interaction with the oil but doesn't completely remove the oil layer like shampoo does. Therefore, the correct answer would be option B: ACV makes the oil cloudy, indicating partial interaction without fully stripping oils.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because its acidic pH helps tighten/close cuticles that shampoo lifts, reducing roughness and tangling.\n\nACV has an acidic pH that can help to counteract the alkaline pH of shampoo, which can cause dryness and tangling. By using ACV as a post-shampoo finisher, the pH of the hair can be balanced, which can help to reduce roughness and tangling. Additionally, ACV contains natural ingredients that can help to nourish and moisturize the hair, which can further improve the health and appearance of the hair.",

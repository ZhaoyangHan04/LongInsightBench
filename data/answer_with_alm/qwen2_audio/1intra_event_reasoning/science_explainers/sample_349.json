    "model_answer": "The segment describes how ancient Greek philosophers, including Aristotle, believed the Earth was flat. This belief persisted until the 16th century when Copernicus proposed the heliocentric model, which placed the Sun at the center of the solar system. However, it took another 200 years for people like Galileo Galilei to confirm the Copernican model through observation. Therefore, option A best demonstrates both the advancement and limitation of the spherical Earth idea by showing how long it took for humans to accept a scientific truth despite earlier evidence to the contrary.",

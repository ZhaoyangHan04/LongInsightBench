    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The lower wheel acts like a water turbine; flowing water spins it without any initial push.\n\nIn the provided time frame, the lower wheel is placed in hot water, causing the water to boil and create steam. This steam flows through a tube connected to the lower wheel, which then acts as a water turbine. As the steam flows through the turbine, it creates torque that causes the wheel to rotate. There is no mention of the presenter giving the top wheel a push or the use of a heavy large wheel to sustain motion.",

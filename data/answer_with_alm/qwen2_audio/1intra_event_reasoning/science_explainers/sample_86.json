    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: Three Navy jets dropped triangular flares that rotated while falling, creating the shapes.\n\nThe description in the audio indicates that the footage showed flying green triangles, which could be interpreted as being created by something dropping from the sky. The most likely explanation for these triangles is that they were created by Navy jets dropping triangular flares. These flares are often used during training exercises and can create artificial light patterns in the sky. They rotate while falling, which would create the appearance of flying triangles.",

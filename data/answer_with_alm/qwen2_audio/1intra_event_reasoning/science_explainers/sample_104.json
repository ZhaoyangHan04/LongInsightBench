    "model_answer": "The direct cause of the visible fizzing is the release of carbon dioxide gas as carbonic acid decomposes, as shown by the equation forming CO2. This process is indicated by the on-screen chemical equation updating and the visual representation of bubbles forming. The other options, such as evaporation of water, air bubbles escaping, or formation of hydrogen gas, may occur simultaneously but are not the direct cause of the fizzing observed.",

    "model_answer": "The correct statement is A: It is near-neutral salt water (around pH 6-7) that can help with dandruff and clarify oily buildup. The narration indicates that after the bubbling subsides, a pH strip is dipped, and a hair pH \"safe zone\" graphic is shown, implying that the solution has a neutral pH around 6-7, which can help with dandruff and clarify oily buildup.",

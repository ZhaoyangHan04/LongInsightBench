    "model_answer": "The speaker argues that popping baking soda right before your ride isn’t a no-brainer because there is high individual variability in response, with effects lower in trained athletes. Additionally, combining sodium bicarbonate with other supplements like caffeine or beta-alanine does not add benefits and may blunt its effect. Furthermore, it consistently decreases performance in cyclists across studies. Lastly, gastrointestinal distress can be severe, and some positive results only appear after excluding participants with GI issues.",

The speaker questions the effectiveness of the transdermal sodium bicarbonate lotion because it is unclear if the observed improvements in heart rate, perceived exertion, and lactate levels translate to actual enhanced cycling performance. Moreover, the study’s methodology might be flawed since it only measured swimming performance without assessing other factors critical for cycling, such as power output, speed, and endurance.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

    "model_answer": "The clip likely places the Enuma Elish tablets and a diagram showing a “12th Planet” with a 3,600-year orbit alongside a Caltech webpage about evidence for a distant “Planet Nine” to argue that the Enuma Elish tablets were actually describing Neptune rather than a new distant planet (Option C). This is because the clip suggests that ancient knowledge about the solar system may have been preserved in the Enuma Elish tablets and that this knowledge aligns with modern scientific theories about the existence of a distant planet called Planet Nine. By placing these two elements side by side, the clip may be implying that the Enuma Elish tablets provide evidence for the existence of Planet Nine, which was only recently discovered based on its gravitational influence on other planets in the outer solar system.",

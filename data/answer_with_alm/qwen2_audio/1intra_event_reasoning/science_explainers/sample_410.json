    "model_answer": "The purpose of showing a close-up of 'U.S. Code ยง 6426' along with the on-screen text 'cost parity = cost the same' is likely to emphasize that the reduction in costs has played a crucial role in making biofuels competitive with traditional fuels like diesel. This legal citation could be referencing specific regulations or incentives provided by the government that have helped make biofuels more affordable. The subtitle also highlights the concept of cost parity, indicating that biofuels have achieved a level where their costs align with those of traditional fuels.",

    "model_answer": "The conclusion that is supported between 00:02:31.630 and 00:03:08.077 is that gas stations rely on in-store retail rather than fuel sales for profits, which is reinforced by the final shot of a well-stocked convenience store after scenes of busy pumps. This visual shows that the majority of the store's products are non-fuel items, implying that the gas station makes more money from selling convenience items than from fuel sales.",

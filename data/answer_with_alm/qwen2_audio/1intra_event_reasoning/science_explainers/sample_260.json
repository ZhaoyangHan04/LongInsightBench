    "model_answer": "The segment displays visuals like “ESTIMATE” and “MIRACLE” after the on-screen note about flight logs to emphasize that for approximately five hours, the plane's position is only marked as an estimate, after which the log suddenly re-establishes in near real-time close to the destination. This suggests that during that period, the tracking data may have been interrupted or not available. Therefore, the correct answer would be A.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on geography for help. The segment justifies relying on public flight-tracking sites for real-time global coverage by stating that these websites tap into the Global Positioning System (GPS) which is a military system with public access levels. The segment also mentions that there are several companies that sell location data to these websites.\n\nThe DoD seal in this context visually implies that the GPS system has military origins, but it does not confirm whether the sites rely on GPS or not. Therefore, we cannot select option A as the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

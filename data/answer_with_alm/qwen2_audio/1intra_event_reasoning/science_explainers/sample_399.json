    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Because increasing the number of slices makes the top and bottom edges smoother and closer to straight segments whose combined lengths approach C/2, even though a close-up still reveals bumpy edges.\nThe statement describes how, as the circle is cut into more and more slices, it resembles a rectangle. This occurs because each additional slice makes the sides of the rectangle smoother and more closely resembles a straight line. However, despite this, when viewed closely, there will still be some small bumps on the edges due to the finite size of the slices.",

The epsilon-delta definition of limits was introduced by Cauchy around 1820, giving mathematical analysis a solid foundation. This led to the rigorous development of calculus. We see visual reinforcement of this connection through the use of modern imagery towards the end of the clip, such as a network of global connections and a medical ultrasound, which symbolize the far-reaching implications of calculus.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

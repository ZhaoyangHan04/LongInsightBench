    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: The hook switch rapidly turns the battery on and off to encode the voice into the line current.\nIn the modern microphone described, the electrical current that is sent to the line circuit and battery is modulated through the use of a hook switch. This switch rapidly turns the battery on and off, which encodes the voice signal into the electrical current before it is transmitted. The other options do not play a role in this modulation process.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Transformers at each end couple the microphone and receiver so both people can speak and hear over a single connection. This allows for efficient two-way speech by eliminating the need for multiple connections or wires. The transformers also manage the types of currents on the line by blocking the steady battery current and allowing the fluctuating 'speech current' to pass through.",

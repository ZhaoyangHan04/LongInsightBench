    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: To choose the correct startup disk (e.g., Macintosh HD) because the Mac may be booting from the wrong drive; the screen shows the flashing folder, then a disk icon with a loading bar indicating drive selection.\nExplanation: In the provided audio segment, the speaker instructs restarting the computer by holding down the Option key. This is typically done when the computer fails to boot correctly or when the user wants to select a specific startup disk other than the default one. The reason for this instruction is that the screen will display a flashing folder with a question mark, which indicates that the startup disk is no longer available. After selecting the correct disk using the Option key, the screen should show a disk icon with a loading bar, indicating that the computer is now attempting to boot from the chosen disk.",

    "model_answer": "The answer should include at least steps A, B, and D. The presenter's process would typically involve preparing the external drive as a new bootable target for a fresh installation of macOS. This includes physically connecting the drive to the computer, ensuring it is recognized by the system, and then using Disk Utility to format the drive. The format step involves selecting the appropriate partition scheme, such as GUID Partition Map, and choosing the desired file system, such as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). It is also important to erase the contents of the drive using Disk Utility's Erase feature to ensure a clean slate for the new installation. Restoring a Time Machine backup may be an optional step depending on the user's needs, but it is not necessarily part of the initial preparation process.",

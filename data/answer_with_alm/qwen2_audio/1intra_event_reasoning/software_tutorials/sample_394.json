    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Because the generator is charging the system and raises the indicated oil pressure without oil movement.\nWhen the generator is operating, it produces electrical power which is then used to charge the aircraft's systems, including the oil pressure indicator. This causes the oil pressure gauge to show a higher reading even if the engine is not turning because there is no actual oil flow through the system. The oil pressure will return to normal once the engine starts and begins producing its own oil pressure.",

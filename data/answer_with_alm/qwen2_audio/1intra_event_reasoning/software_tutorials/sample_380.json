    "model_answer": "The user should rename Kodi.exe to portable_kodi.exe before creating the shortcut to ensure that the installation runs in portable mode from the USB drive. This is because the name 'Kodi' may be interpreted differently by different systems, leading to compatibility issues. Renaming it to 'portable_kodi.exe' avoids this issue and ensures that the installation runs correctly in portable mode.",

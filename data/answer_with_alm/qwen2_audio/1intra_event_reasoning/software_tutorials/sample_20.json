    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: It uses the flat fifth—often called a blues note—within the pentatonic to color the lick.\nIn the provided excerpt, Christopher Dall describes how they will be looking at some Kirk Hammett-inspired licks and trying to come up with their own stuff. Specifically, he mentions that during 00:06:18.031-00:07:35.665, when \"lick 2\" appears on screen, the lick takes on a bluesy color. This suggests that the lick employs techniques or notes that are commonly associated with blues music, such as the use of the flat fifth (also known as a blues note) within the pentatonic scale. To apply this lick, Christopher Dall recommends mixing the pattern's rhythms and applying it across wider arpeggios or scale patterns.",

In this case, the sequence D--U--D--U--U--U--U represents a 16-beat strumming pattern where the first, fourth, seventh, and so on beats are emphasized. The numbers 1 through 7 are placed underneath the sequence to indicate which beats should be strummed more strongly than others.",

However, he does add accents on specific counts (1 and 4 initially, then also on 7, and later on 10, 12, 14, and 16) while discussing the dynamics of the pattern on the guitar. This indicates that he shapes the groove by accentuating certain beats, which could make the pattern more interesting and dynamic.",

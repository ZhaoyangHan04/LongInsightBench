    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: The existing material is deleted and a procedural texture is linked directly to the Principled BSDF before baking.\nIn the provided video, the speaker mentions that after importing the 3D data into Blender, they want to show how to clean up the mesh, materials, and textures to make it more useful in projects. In this process, the first issue encountered is that the 3D data comes in as lots of little tiles, which would be easier to work with if it were one object. To address this, the speaker goes over to select the objects and delete the existing material. Then, a procedural texture is linked directly to the Principled BSDF before baking. This ensures that the baked image will have consistent appearance across all parts of the model.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: To keep the line work above while adding shadows underneath, so the shadows fall below the outlines.\n\nExplanation: In Adobe Illustrator, duplicating a layer and locking the top copy allows the user to add shadows underneath without affecting the original line work. This technique is commonly used when creating illustrations where the lines are the primary element and the background or shading is added later. By locking the top layer, the user ensures that any changes made to the shadow layer will not affect the line work. Additionally, by placing the shadows underneath the line work, they create a sense of depth and dimensionality in the illustration.",

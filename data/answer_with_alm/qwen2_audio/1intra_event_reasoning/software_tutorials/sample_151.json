    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Add a Chroma Key filter in OBS keyed to the chosen background color to remove it. \n\nThe presenter mentions using a solid key color as the background of the LiveSplit layout and then adding a chroma key filter in OBS to remove the background. This allows for a transparent-looking timer on the stream. The other options mentioned either do not relate to achieving a transparent timer or are not specific enough to the given time frame.",

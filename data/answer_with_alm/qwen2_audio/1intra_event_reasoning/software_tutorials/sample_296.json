    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Click the specific sitemap row to view detailed errors and consult the Search Console Help Centerâ€™s list of errors.\nAccording to the interface feedback, if the submitted sitemap doesn't show a \"Success\" status, the user should click on the specific sitemap row to view detailed errors. The narrator's guidance also confirms that users should click on the specific sitemap row to view detailed errors and consult the Search Console Help Center's list of errors.\nOption B is incorrect because deleting the entire Search Console property and setting it up again from scratch is not a recommended solution for this issue.\nOption C is incorrect because ignoring the issue may result in the user missing important information about the error and potentially losing time and effort in resolving it.\nOption D is incorrect because submitting a reconsideration request under Manual Actions does not necessarily guarantee that the error will be lifted. It depends on the nature and severity of the error.",

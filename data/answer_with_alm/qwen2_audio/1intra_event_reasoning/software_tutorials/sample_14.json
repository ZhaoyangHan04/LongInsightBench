    "model_answer": "The presenter demonstrates and describes how to manually select DRAM Frequency values and adjust timings for overclocking memory. They mention that these adjustments should be done through the BIOS and not within Windows Task Manager after boot. The expected behavior is that the motherboard may power-cycle several times and prompt you if it can’t boot with the new settings. Therefore, the correct answer would be B: Manually selecting DRAM Frequency values (e.g., 2400–3200 MHz) and adjusting timings.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: To illustrate raycasting: a single ray is cast from the camera through each pixel to find the closest intersection and its color.\n\nThe white line drawn across the two spheres in the time interval from 00:03:40.911 to 00:04:06.032 serves as a visual aid to demonstrate how raycasting works. Raycasting involves casting a single ray from the virtual camera through each pixel of the image to determine which objects it intersects with and what colors they should appear. This technique is commonly used in computer graphics to create realistic images and animations.",

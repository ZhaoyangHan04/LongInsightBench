This action is then demonstrated on a smartphone. Therefore, the reason for the change in the on-screen \"Subscribe\" button to \"SUBSCRIBED\" with a bell icon during this segment is because the speaker is showing how to subscribe to their channel by performing these actions on a phone.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: Because the system requires uploading a new profile picture before a name change can be saved, making a Page conversion simpler.\n\nThe speaker mentions that after logging into Facebook, they were unable to change their account name because the system required them to upload a new profile picture first. This implies that the process of changing the account name would be easier and quicker if they created a Facebook Page instead. Additionally, the speaker advises creating a Page even if the current account name represents a business or public figure, as per Facebook's guidelines, which supports the idea that a Page would be a better option in this case.",

    "model_answer": "The transitions from sunset to night sky and the on-screen brightness controls suggest that Bubble Clouds uses separate daytime and nighttime brightness settings (including ambient brightness) that automatically switch at sunrise and sunset. This is indicated by the change in the color scheme of the screen and the adjustment of the brightness levels as the sun sets and rises. The ambient brightness feature is also likely used to adjust the screen brightness according to the surrounding light conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is A: It uses separate daytime and nighttime brightness settings (including ambient brightness) that automatically switch at sunrise and sunset.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on computer history for help. In 2009, when OpenBSD was still relatively new, it was possible to install it on a single-board computer like the BeagleBone Black, which had a small form factor and could be used as a media center device. The narrator mentions standing on a stool to brush his teeth, implying that the BeagleBone was placed on a table or shelf where it could be reached easily. This setup could have been used to run OpenBSD as a media center device, supporting the option A.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

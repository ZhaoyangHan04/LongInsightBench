    "model_answer": "The narrator talks about \"post-holing\" while showing a title card about testing snow depth and a person using a probe likely because they want to demonstrate how important it is to test the snow depth before行走 in deep, soft snow to avoid getting stuck or \"post-holed\". Therefore, the correct answer would be A: To connect the demonstration of probing snow depth with the goal of avoiding post-holing in deep, soft snow.",

    "model_answer": "The most reliable evidence for the gold content of the ring is option B: An on-screen text identifies it as a 14K yellow gold ring with white gold crosses. This is because it is a specific and detailed description provided by someone with expertise in jewelry, and it matches the description given by the speaker later in the video.

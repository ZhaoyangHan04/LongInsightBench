    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because there are countless wet stretches and ongoing beaver activity creates new flooded spots, making dry boots unrealistic even aside from stream crossings.\n\nThe narrator mentions that even on the NPT (National Park Trail), which is typically considered relatively dry, it's difficult to keep boots dry due to the numerous wet stretches and ongoing beaver activity creating new flooded spots. This means that throughout the hike, hikers will likely encounter areas where their boots will become wet, making it impossible to maintain dry feet the entire time.",

However, it does describe the scene where the hiker reaches the summit of his first Munro and takes a moment to appreciate the view from the summit cairn. This is confirmed by the visual cue of the camera showing him at the cairn. Options A, C, and D do not provide sufficient evidence to confirm that the hiker has reached the summit.",

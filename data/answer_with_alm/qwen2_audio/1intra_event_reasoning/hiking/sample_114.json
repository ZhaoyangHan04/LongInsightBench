    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Because the cloudy conditions reduce visibility, so shorter swings help him see the coil better.\nThe speaker mentions using short little blasts as he starts to grid the spot in the grassy field under cloudy skies. This suggests that the visibility is reduced due to the clouds, making it harder to see the grid clearly. By using shorter swings, the speaker can better navigate around any obstacles in the field while still covering a larger area quickly. This technique allows him to effectively grid the area without wasting time or missing any spots.",

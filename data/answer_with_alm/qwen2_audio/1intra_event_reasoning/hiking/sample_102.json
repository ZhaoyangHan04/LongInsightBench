    "model_answer": "The strong \"booming 30\" reading corresponds to option C: A blue toy car that he calls “better than a quarter.”\n\nThe context clues suggest that the speaker is referring to something valuable or noteworthy that he finds better than a quarter. The description of the sound as 'booming' implies it's a loud, impressive noise, which could be associated with a valuable or large object.

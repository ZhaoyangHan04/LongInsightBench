    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Because water levels are low enough to reach deeper crevices, but the water becomes silty and dirty when disturbed.\n\nThe speaker mentioned that during summer sniping, they have to wade through the riverbed, which can become muddy and dirty due to low water levels. This makes it challenging to spot gold, but also provides an opportunity to access areas that might otherwise be inaccessible.",

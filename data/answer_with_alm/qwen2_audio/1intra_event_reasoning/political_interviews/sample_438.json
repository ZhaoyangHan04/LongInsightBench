    "model_answer": "The answer is A: It’s described as enabling people to build equity when wages rise while rent stays the same; a male voice speaks while footage shows Kim Coco Iwamoto on screen. This description aligns with the concept of rent control being a tool for individuals to save money and build wealth over time, especially during periods when wages are increasing but housing costs remain stable. The mention of a male voice speaking over footage also indicates that this is likely a narration rather than a direct statement from the on-screen individual, Kim Coco Iwamoto.",

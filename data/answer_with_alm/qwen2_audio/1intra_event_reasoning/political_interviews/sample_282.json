    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are B and C. The patriotic graphics labeled OREGON and ELECTION 2020 at the start of the segment, along with the dramatic orchestral music playing in the background, both suggest that this is the official introduction to a voter guide rather than a candidate advertisement. The mention of the League of Women Voters and a partnership with Metro East Community Media also supports this interpretation.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: The host verbally thanks viewers and reminds them about the primary election and voting, after which the screen switches to a blue information screen with stars, voter information websites, a “Don’t forget to cast your ballot!” message, and sponsor acknowledgments as orchestral music plays.\n\nThis can be inferred from the description provided in the question and the options given. At 00:08:36.591, the video shows the host thanking the guest for her thoughts. After this, there is no mention of the guest until 00:09:19.949, which suggests that the conversation has ended and the focus has shifted to the closing voter information segment. \n\nAt 00:09:19.949, the screen transitions to a blue information screen with voter information websites, a reminder to vote, and sponsor acknowledgments. This is accompanied by the playing of motivational orchestral music. These elements suggest that the video is now transitioning into the closing voter information segment.",

    "model_answer": "The combination of clues A, B, and D suggest that the voters' guide segment is concluding during 00:08:03.010-00:09:06.551 (event_id: 10). An announcer stating that this is the end of the voters' guide and reminding viewers about the upcoming primary election indicates the segment's conclusion. The visuals shifting from the interview to blue star-field screens listing the Video Voters' Guide and voter information websites also suggest the end of the segment as it moves away from the current topic. Additionally, the participants waving goodbye while confetti falls on screen could be a part of the closing ceremony, further indicating the conclusion of the voters' guide segment. Therefore, the correct answer would be all three options A, B, and D.",

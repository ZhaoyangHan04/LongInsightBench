The speaker advises paying particular attention to titles and abstracts because they are often the first things reviewers will see, and if they are clear and concise, it can help the paper move swiftly through peer review. Additionally, the speaker mentions that clear titles and abstracts can also help increase the paper's impact after publication by making it easier for others to understand and cite the research. However, the speaker does not suggest that adding more figures will guarantee acceptance without further review or skipping submission guidelines will speed up handling and review.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: She notes signals are expected to drift in time and frequency due to differential acceleration between an exoplanet and Earth, and the sequence from telescopes under the Milky Way to the frequency chart visually contextualizes this search for drifting narrowband signals.\n\nIn the audio, the speaker mentions that the search is focused on narrowband, drifting signals, and provides visual aids such as a radio-frequency chart and a static star field to support this focus. She also notes that the signals are expected to drift due to the differential acceleration between an exoplanet and Earth. This information helps to explain why the search is focused on narrowband, drifting signals, and how the visual aids support this search by providing context about the expected characteristics of the signals being sought.",

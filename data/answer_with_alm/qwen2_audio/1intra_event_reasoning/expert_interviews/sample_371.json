    "model_answer": "The balance scale shifting to include a tombstone opposite a microscope, with a syringe drawn pointing toward the tombstone, suggests that the speaker is illustrating the gravity and consequences of the situation regarding COVID-19. The tombstone symbolically represents the inevitability of death, while the microscope indicates the ongoing study and understanding of the virus. This image implies that although we may not fully understand the disease and its long-term effects, we must consider the potential risks associated with not taking action, such as increased mortality rates. Therefore, the message conveyed is that scientists need more time to fully understand the virus before society can safely resume normal activities, implying that accepting deaths is not acceptable at this stage. Option A correctly interprets the meaning of the image.",

The video seems to imply that there may be a discrepancy between the official statistics on COVID-19 cases and the actual number of people infected, particularly among children who may be less likely to show symptoms or get tested. This could be due to various factors such as underreporting, lack of testing capacity, or differences in how the virus affects different age groups.",

    "model_answer": "B: He was sent a copy of the show, immersed himself in it for a week, did one rehearsal, and then went to the Dubai Jazz Festival; the inset shows live concert performances that align with his touring story.\n\nThe audio mentions that the interviewee stepped into a project on very short notice and had to prepare quickly. This is supported by the visual element showing him watching a show and immersing himself in it for a week before the event. Additionally, the mention of going to the Dubai Jazz Festival indicates that he was ready to perform immediately after preparing. The live concert performances in the inset also align with this context.",

    "model_answer": "The most likely answer is A: He’s referring to the same touring bass that the airline damaged, and he kept using it by gaffer taping the cracked body until repairs in Germany. This is the only option that makes sense in the context of the speech, as it explains why the bass player would be showing a poster of himself with a crack in it and why he would have been using a repaired bass during the tour. The other options don’t fit the context as well as option A.",

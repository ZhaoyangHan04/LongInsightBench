By referencing specific examples such as autism theories and radio-wave claims associated with these Nobel laureates, the presenter argues that winning a Nobel Prize does not necessarily indicate exceptional judgment or reliability in other areas of expertise.",

The speaker seems to be making an argument that just because someone has a high IQ does not mean they will make good judgments all the time. He uses the example of the 'intelligence' charts to show how people with higher IQs may still have biases, thus the IQ boost may not necessarily lead to better reasoning outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: She explicitly discusses the Museum of Gulag’s online project offering the Balanda soup recipe and calls the humor “rather dark,” while a large screen behind her displays English recipe-like text (e.g., about rotten vegetables).\n\nIn this clip, the speaker talks about the Museum of Gulag's online project that includes a recipe for Balanda soup. She specifically mentions that the recipe contains rotten vegetables, which is a dark joke related to the history of the Soviet Union's concentration camps. The fact that she explicitly discusses the darkness of the humor indicates that it is intended to be taken seriously and not just as a casual remark. Additionally, the display of the English recipe-like text on the screen further emphasizes the theme of the project and reinforces the connection between the humor and the historical context.",

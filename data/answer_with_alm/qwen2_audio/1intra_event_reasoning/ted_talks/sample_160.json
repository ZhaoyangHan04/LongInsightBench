    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Because microsatellites are forced to rideshare on larger rockets—“like sharing your house with ten other families”──while the slide shows current capacity under 300 satellites per year versus a desired capacity over 1000.\n\nThe presenter characterizes existing launch options as \"dismal\" because they are unable to meet the growing demand for satellite launches, particularly for small and medium-sized satellites known as microsatellites. The speaker mentions that microsatellites are often forced to ride-share on larger rockets, which limits their access to space and increases costs. This situation is further exacerbated by the fact that microsatellites tend to be heavier and more expensive to develop than traditional satellites. Additionally, the speaker notes that there has been a decrease in the total number of satellites launched from 2015 to 2020, which could indicate a lack of investment in new launch capabilities. However, none of these factors directly address the issue of ridesharing and capacity constraints faced by microsatellites.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: He argues for franchising production near customers, and a slide pairs “Franchise Rocket Manufacturing” with a McDonald’s image to illustrate the model.\nThe presenter justifies a franchised, high-throughput rocket manufacturing approach by stating that it would be more efficient and cost-effective to produce rockets near the customer, similar to how McDonald's franchises its restaurants to increase speed of service and reduce costs. The slide featuring a McDonald's image reinforces this argument by showing the scalability and standardization of the franchise model.",

    "model_answer": "A: Because the narrator explains that dissent purposefully challenges the status quo and invites questioning, so the sign visually reinforces that call.\n\nThe bold \"DISRUPT\" sign in the clip appears during a moment where the narrator is discussing the importance of dissent and challenging the status quo. This suggests that the sign is meant to emphasize the urgency and importance of taking action and disrupting the normative narrative in order to bring about change. The fact that it appears immediately after visual cues like \"Fight injustice,\" \"Protest!\" and \"Raise your voice\" further supports this interpretation, as these phrases are all calling for action and disruption.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The referee raises the fighter’s hand while he holds a championship belt, and an announcer proclaims him the “Undisputed Welterweight Champion of the World.”\n\nThis is because the reference to the fighter holding a championship belt and being proclaimed the champion indicates that he has won the welterweight title. The other options either describe a different scenario (B: Two fighters grapple, C: A man drinking and tense music, D: An analyst discussing statistics), do not mention the outcome of the event, or are too ambiguous to be considered conclusive evidence of victory.",

    "model_answer": "Option B best explains the clip's dual emphasis as it features a man wearing a red \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN\" cap and championship belt, which represents overt patriotism, along with the sound of him saying \"I'm bringing this to the White House,\" suggesting a connection to politics. Additionally, the inclusion of sailors raising the American flag reinforces the patriotic theme. The visual also aligns with the audio by showing a fighter in a similar red color and a background of a UFC event, indicating that the fighting style being discussed is related to the sport.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The backlight adds a rim highlight that makes him pop from the background.\n\nIn lighting, a rim highlight is created when a light source is placed behind the subject, casting a shadow on their hair or clothing while illuminating their face. This creates a sense of depth and dimensionality. In this scenario, the fill light and the backlight work together to create this effect, with the fill light reducing facial shadows and the backlight adding a rim highlight around the seated man's face.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: The muslin diffuses the underlight for softness, and the top light is used intentionally to cast unflattering shadows that heighten drama.\nIn the scene described, the use of white bleached muslin as a diffuser for the bottom light helps to soften any harsh shadows that might be created, making the character appear more natural and less threatening. Later in the scene, when a top light is turned on above the character, it is used to create unflattering shadows that add depth and drama to the scene. This lighting setup helps to enhance the mood and emotional impact of the scene.",

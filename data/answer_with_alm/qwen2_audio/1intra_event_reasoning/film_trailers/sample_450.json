    "model_answer": "The visuals do not directly reinforce the male speaker's goal of telling young, contemporary African stories. The clip jumps between unrelated scenes such as a motorcycle wheelie, a live fashion runway, and generic cityscape shots, without a clear narrative that aligns with the theme of contemporary African culture. Therefore, I cannot select option A or B. Option C is also unlikely, as it does not account for the dynamic nature of the content shown. Option D seems like a plausible choice if the final shot was meant to emphasize reflection rather than energy, but without additional context, it is unclear whether this is the case.",

This is supported by the statement where the speaker mentions that despite the large number of people seen in the background, the core team was only about 25 people.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: He switches back to normal speed to capture the toss into the bin in real time so it can be cleanly combined with the earlier shot in post.\n\nThe creator likely starts with a normal-speed shot of eating the banana to set the scene and context for the video. However, when he gets to the trash can, he realizes that he needs to capture the toss into the bin in real time to create a seamless transition between the two shots. By switching back to normal speed, he can capture the toss quickly and then seamlessly blend it with the previous shot using editing software in post-production. This technique helps to keep the video cohesive and engaging for the viewer.",

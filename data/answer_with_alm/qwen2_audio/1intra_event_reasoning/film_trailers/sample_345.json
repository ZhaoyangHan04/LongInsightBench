    "model_answer": "The best explanation would be A: They limited gear to one camera and mainly one lens (plus one wider lens) and used existing/practical lighting and sunlight, which matches the naturalistic interiors and daylight exteriors seen. This approach aligns with the description of the production keeping the schedule to 25 days by being efficient and resourceful, as well as the use of practical locations and lighting. The other options either do not align with the provided information or are less likely to have been used in such a production setup.",

    "model_answer": "The speaker suggests using a telephoto adapter mid-take as a way to get close-ups and wide shots while shooting a whole project with one lens. This is supported by the on-screen anamorphic lens text that indicates the use of a single lens/camera combo, which may require creative adjustments like using accessories like telephoto adapters to achieve different shot types.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Because there was strong backlighting creating separation, and the shooter used a quick two-light setup with one light behind the camera and a hard light behind the drums.\n\nIn the provided excerpt, the shooter mentions that due to the strong backlight, the guitarist's silhouette stood out against the rest of the scene. To achieve this effect, the shooter used a simple two-light setup. One light was positioned behind the camera to provide a soft, even background, while the other light was placed behind the drummer to create a harder, more dramatic shadow on the guitarist's silhouette. This setup allowed the guitarist's outline to pop and stand out from the rest of the scene.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: He’s framed as a friendly personification of danger, which is echoed by lighthearted imagery (vacation attire, bathtub bubbles) that keeps the tone approachable rather than frightening.\n\nThis statement is supported by the audio where it mentions that the character's tone is meant to be friendly and approachable while still conveying the idea of danger. This is achieved through the use of playful and non-threatening visuals such as the character wearing a Hawaiian shirt and relaxing in a bubble bath. These visuals help to create a contrast between the character's friendly persona and the potentially frightening nature of their role as a security expert.",

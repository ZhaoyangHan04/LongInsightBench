Therefore, the answer is unknown.\n\nHowever, the presenter concludes that the status of SID and EMAIL in that scenario remains unchanged, implying that they continue to serve as the primary key and alternate key, respectively. Option B is the closest match to this conclusion, but without additional context, we cannot definitively select any option.",

Option B supports this by stating that the example provided in the slide is of a compound key that includes at least one foreign key attribute.\n\nTogether, these two options correctly identify that the combination of 'REG_ID' and 'BRANCH_CODE' is considered a compound key because it consists of more than one attribute and includes at least one foreign key attribute.",

    "model_answer": "The shift from a crossed-out armed standoff to a handshake illustrates a move from violent conflict to negotiation. This transition often occurs when both parties recognize the futility of violence and seek to resolve their differences through peaceful means. The fact that they are able to shake hands suggests that they have reached some sort of agreement or understanding.\n\nAs for each side's bargaining power, it ultimately depends on a variety of factors such as their resources, capabilities, and interests. In this situation, the parties may also be influenced by broader social, political, and economic factors that shape the terms of their negotiation. For example, consumer preferences or societal norms may play a role in shaping the outcome of the negotiations. Ultimately, the bargaining power of each side will depend on their ability to influence these factors and achieve their desired outcomes.",

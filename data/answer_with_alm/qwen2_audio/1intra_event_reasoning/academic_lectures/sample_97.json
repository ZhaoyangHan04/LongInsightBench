    "model_answer": "Answer: A: To visually support the narrator’s discussion of the Acropolis rebuild under Pericles and the classical ideal of sculpture—balancing realism with idealized proportions—by showing the temple and then the proportional canon on the body.\nThe artist first draws a classical temple to establish a reference point for the discussion of classical architecture and its principles. By overlaying red proportion guides on the male statue drawing, the artist emphasizes the idea of balancing realism with idealized proportions, which is a key aspect of classical sculpture. This visual aid helps the audience understand the concept being explained by the narrator.",

This suggests that the scene is depicting the restoration process of Trajan's Column, which is a famous ancient monument in Rome. The use of a film clapperboard could indicate that the restoration work is being documented, possibly for educational or promotional purposes.",

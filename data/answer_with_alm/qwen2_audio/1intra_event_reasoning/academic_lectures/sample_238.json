    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: To expose all instrument surfaces to the autoclave's hot air for effective sterilization.\n\nInstruments such as forceps, retractors, and clamps need to be thoroughly cleaned and sterilized before use in surgical procedures. Autoclaves are used to kill bacteria and other microorganisms by subjecting them to high temperatures and pressures. The instructor keeps the instrument hinges and the speculum open during arrangement of the set to ensure that all surfaces of the instruments are exposed to the hot air inside the autoclave. This helps in achieving effective sterilization and reducing the risk of infection.\n\nOption B is incorrect because keeping the instrument hinges and the speculum open does not prevent the metal from warping during transport to the autoclave. Option C is incorrect because the set being arranged has nothing to do with making it appear more comprehensive for the demonstration. Option D is incorrect because keeping the instrument hinges and the speculum open does not allow for more instruments to be placed on the drape.",

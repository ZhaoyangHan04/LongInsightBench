    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: They publish a report with recommendations that the government is expected to respond to (typically within about 60 days).\n\nSelect committees in Parliament are responsible for scrutinizing the work of government departments and agencies. They typically conduct inquiries into specific policy areas, such as health care, education, or international aid. As part of their work, select committees may call expert witnesses and members of the public to give evidence that informs their inquiry. They may also hold hearings where they question witnesses and receive evidence in person.\n\nAfter completing their inquiry, select committees publish a report that summarizes their findings and makes recommendations for changes or improvements to government policy. The government is then expected to respond to the report within a specified period of time, usually around 60 days. This process helps to ensure that the work of government is transparent and accountable to Parliament and the public.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Both Houses must agree to the bill and the monarch must give formal approval, shown by a yellow seal with a crown on the document.\n\nThe process of making a bill into law in the UK Parliament involves several steps. After a bill is introduced in either the House of Commons or the House of Lords, it goes through various stages of consideration and amendment. Eventually, if it passes both houses, it is sent to the monarch for royal assent, which gives it the force of law. This process typically involves the signing of the bill by the monarch, although they may also choose to grant assent subject to reservations or conditions.\n\nIn the audio clip, the passage of time from 00:04:42.263 to 00:05:12.472 represents the progression of a bill through the parliamentary process, ultimately leading to its royal assent and becoming law.",

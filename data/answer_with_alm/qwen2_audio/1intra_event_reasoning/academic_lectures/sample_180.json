The comparative method has its limitations, such as only working over short time spans and meaning changes erasing similarities, which is signaled by the clock icon appearing alongside vocabulary comparisons.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

    "model_answer": "The speaker says only “a little bit but not a lot” can be known about Proto-World because the timescales involved are immense, which limits the amount of information that can be reconstructed. This idea is visually anchored through the use of a timeline that shows humans in Africa around 100,000 years before present and a 7-million-year split from chimpanzees. Additionally, there is a human-chimpanzee-bonobo divergence diagram and maps with question marks that further emphasize the limitations of reconstructing Proto-World due to the vastness of time. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Because the timescales involved are immense—humans in Africa around 100,000 years before present and a 7-million-year split from chimpanzees—so reconstruction is limited; this is anchored visually by the 100,000 YBP timeline, the human–chimp–bonobo divergence diagram, and maps with question marks.",

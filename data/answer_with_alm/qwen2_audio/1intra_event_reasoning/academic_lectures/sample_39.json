    "model_answer": "The timer showing 0:00 signifies the start of a 15-minute undisturbed wait after thorough mixing. The next instructed action would be to begin the spectrophotometer reading, which should be done immediately after the 15-minute wait. Therefore, the correct answer is A: It marks the start of a 15-minute undisturbed wait after thorough mixing.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The hemoglobin is approximately 14.8 g/dL, read off directly where the OD intersects the plotted standard curve.\nExplanation: In order to determine the hemoglobin level from the absorbance reading, we need to first plot the absorbance values against the known hemoglobin concentrations. Once this standard curve is created, we can read off the hemoglobin concentration at the point where the absorbance of our sample (0.32) intersects the curve. This method assumes that the calibration curve is accurate and that the Beer-Lambert law applies to the system being used.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: By connecting the batteryâ€™s positive and negative terminals to the bulb with wires and closing the switch to complete the circuit, as shown with the lit bulb in the diagram.\n\nIn the provided excerpt, the speaker explains that to make a simple circuit with a bulb, one should connect the positive terminal of the battery to the bulb's base (option A) and also connect the negative terminal of the battery to the other side of the switch (option A). The speaker then closes the switch, completing the circuit, which causes the bulb to light up (option A).\n\nOption B is incorrect because there is no mention of touching a danger sign to the wire. Option C is incorrect because it suggests that the bulb might glow even without a battery or a switch, which is not the case. Option D is incorrect because it implies that symbols represent physical connections, but in this context, symbols are used to show what components are connected, not their physical location.",

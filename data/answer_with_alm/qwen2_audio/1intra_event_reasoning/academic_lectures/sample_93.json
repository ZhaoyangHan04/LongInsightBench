    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: It is the magnetic bearing, calculated by adding magnetic declination to the true bearing and verified with a calculator.\n\nIn this context, the instructor is measuring the angle between two points on the map using a protractor. The true bearing is the angular measurement relative to North, referenced from the magnetic north. To obtain the magnetic bearing, the instructor adds the magnetic declination to the true bearing. Magnetic declination is the angle between the Earth's magnetic field and true north, which varies at different locations on the planet. Finally, the instructor verifies the magnetic bearing using a calculator.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because it’s a magnetic bearing, which is recorded without a direction letter; it was obtained by adding the true bearing (94°) to the magnetic declination (23° 01').\nIn this context, the speaker mentions that magnetic bearings don't include the direction. This implies that when adding the true bearing and magnetic declination to get the magnetic bearing, the resulting angle doesn't indicate the direction of the bearing. Therefore, the direction letter is typically omitted from magnetic bearings.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: To illustrate how large-scale order can arise without centralized control, exemplifying self-organization and the emergence of global patterns. The video likely uses the visual aids of flocks of birds and connected hexagonal patterns to demonstrate how complex systems can organize themselves into patterns without the need for a central controlling entity. This aligns with the concept of emergence, where emergent properties arise from the interactions of individual components within a system, leading to patterns that cannot be predicted by examining each component in isolation.",

    "model_answer": "The video appears to be illustrating the concept of complexity theory, which deals with understanding how complex systems behave through the use of theoretical frameworks. The balance labeled \"Equilibrium\" and \"NonEquilibrium\" likely represents the distinction between stable and unstable states of a system. The depiction of people in motion with circular arrows suggests that these systems are dynamic and constantly changing. The final image of a person labeled \"Linear Thinking\" hammering a box labeled \"Complex System\" seems to suggest that attempting to understand complex systems using linear, simplistic approaches may not be effective.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be A: That far-from-equilibrium change is governed by feedback loops, so applying linear, hammer-like methods to complex systems is inappropriate. This conclusion emphasizes the importance of considering feedback loops and nonlinear dynamics when studying complex systems.",

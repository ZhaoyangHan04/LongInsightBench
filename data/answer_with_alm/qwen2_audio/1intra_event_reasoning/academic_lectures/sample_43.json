    "model_answer": "The speaker seems to be implying that during the time period mentioned (AD 1058-1111), there was a peak in the advancement of mathematics in certain parts of the world, particularly in Baghdad. The portrait of Imam Hamid al-Ghazali, who lived during this time, may suggest his influence on intellectual developments of the era. However, it's important to note that the speaker does not explicitly state the connection between al-Ghazali's influence and the decline of mathematics later on. Therefore, the answer cannot be definitively chosen based on the provided information.",

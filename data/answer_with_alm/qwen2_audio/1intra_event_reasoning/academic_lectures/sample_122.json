    "model_answer": "The speaker who explains that competition actually accelerates collaboration in genomics is John Sulston. The specific quote from him is 'By making personal breakthroughs that are immediately shared, thereby ratcheting each other up,' which emphasizes the idea that competition pushes scientists to improve their work and share it quickly with others, thereby fostering collaboration.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Because early sequencing lacked automation and would be painstakingly slow; the change is signaled by a motor starting sound and visuals of a robotic arm dispensing into a microplate with “ Harness the Data.”\n\nThe audio clip compares the Human Genome Project to monks copying a book, implying that it was a labor-intensive and time-consuming endeavor. This is supported by the description of early sequencing methods being manual and requiring a lot of effort. The audio also includes a visual cue of a motor starting and a robotic arm dispensing material into a microplate, which symbolizes the introduction of automation into the process, making it faster and more efficient. This transition from manual labor to automated processes is highlighted by the phrase \"Harvest the Data,\" suggesting that the project has evolved to a point where data can be easily collected and analyzed.",

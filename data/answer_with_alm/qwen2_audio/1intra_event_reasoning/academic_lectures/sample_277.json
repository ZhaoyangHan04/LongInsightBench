    "model_answer": "Answer: A: To better localize findings seen on the frontal film and assess costophrenic angles/diaphragms; the images switch to side-on projections labeled with an \"L.\"\n\nThe reason for switching from a frontal to a lateral chest X-ray is to better visualize certain structures in the chest, such as the costophrenic angles and diaphragm. The \"L\" marking on the screen indicates that the current view is a laterality, which helps confirm the selection of the appropriate projection for examination.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: They are active Cascade volcanoes fed by subduction of an oceanic plate beneath North America.\nExplanation: The arrows in the map indicate the location of two prominent volcanoes in California, Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak. These mountains are part of the Cascades volcanic range, which is formed by the subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate beneath the North American Plate. This subduction process brings hot, molten rock from the mantle up to the surface, forming volcanoes like Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: The eruption was large enough to disperse ash broadly across the western U.S., consistent with a caldera-forming event.\nThe map shows widespread distribution of Bishop ash, which suggests a significant eruption that could have dispersed ash over a wide area. Additionally, the narration mentions that Long Valley Caldera is one of the largest calderas in the world, which further supports the idea of a large eruption that created the caldera. This type of eruption is consistent with the formation of a caldera, as it involves the collapse of the volcano's cone after a massive eruption.",

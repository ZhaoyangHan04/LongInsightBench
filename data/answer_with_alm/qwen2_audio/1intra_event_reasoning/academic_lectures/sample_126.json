    "model_answer": "Based on the sequence described, it is likely that option B is the correct answer. The sequence contrasts a \"SECURITY\" robot with an apple labeled \"IN PRIVACY Terms,\" suggesting a theme related to privacy versus security. This is followed by a classical building, which could represent the grandeur and stability of traditional institutions. However, the fact that the FBI was unable to access encrypted devices despite public backlash implies that there was no court decision in favor of either privacy or security. Instead, the situation seems to have ended in a standoff between Apple and the FBI, with both sides claiming victory but without a clear resolution. Therefore, the absence of a court ruling suggests that the FBI did not succeed in its efforts to access encrypted data, and this could be seen as a setback for privacy.",

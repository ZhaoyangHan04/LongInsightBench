    "model_answer": "The most likely answer is A: They have just welcomed a baby boy there, and mother and baby are doing well. This is a common occurrence when a new baby is born in a hospital, and both parents may be seen walking down the hospital steps with their newborn in a baby carrier, accompanied by hospital staff and possibly family members. The presence of police officers could indicate a security detail or other official function related to the hospital, but it is not necessarily directly connected to the birth of a baby.",

The mention of a midwife-led birth service and the reference to costs associated with private healthcare also support this option.",

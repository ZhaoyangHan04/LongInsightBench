    "model_answer": "D: The advice stresses passion and not giving up other life aspects too early, while the visuals reinforce the chess context by showing the young man at the board.\n\nThe speech portion of the audio mentions that the advice comes from someone who has achieved success in chess, specifically winning the women's world championship at a young age and holding the title four times. This suggests that the person giving the advice has experience and knowledge in the game.\n\nThe visual representation of the advice is through a shot of a young man sitting at a chessboard, deep in concentration. This image reinforces the idea of chess as the primary focus of the advice and emphasizes the dedication required to become a successful player.\n\nTherefore, option D best fits the context by summarizing the content of the speech and the visual representation of the advice.",

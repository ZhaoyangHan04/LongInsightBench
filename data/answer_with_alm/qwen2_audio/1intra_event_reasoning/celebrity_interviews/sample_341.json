    "model_answer": "The most likely answer is A: They are delivering donations to charities and foster homes, as described by the narrator about X giving over $100,000 in goods and cash. The mention of unloading boxes and items from a van in a parking lot suggests that they are involved in some kind of charitable activity, and the context implies that the donations are being delivered to various organizations. The other options (setting up equipment for a radio interview, moving into a new residence, preparing merchandise for sale) don't seem to be supported by the information provided in the audio clip.",

    "model_answer": "The answer should be based on the context clues provided in the speech. The mention of 'radio station' suggests option B, as that is a common setting for interviews. Also, since there's no mention of an audience, it rules out options A and D. Option C seems less likely because a closed classroom would typically have a smaller audience than a radio station. Therefore, the most probable answer is B: Inside a radio station studio during a quiet interview.",

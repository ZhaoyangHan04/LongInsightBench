    "model_answer": "The reason for the scene showing a studio-like room with paints and brushes is likely option D: because the video crew set up a temporary craft space solely for this shoot. This would explain the presence of art supplies and a workbench in a place that is not necessarily meant for such purposes in the homeowner's house.",

    "model_answer": "The visuals and audio suggest that the kitchen is used by the homeowner as a functional space for cooking, rather than just a showpiece or storage area. The sound of pots and pans being moved around implies that food preparation takes place there, and the overall aesthetic of the kitchen indicates that it is a lived-in space rather than solely a display area. Therefore, option B, \"It is the most used room where the homeowner cooks daily with friends,\" seems like the most likely answer based on the available evidence.",

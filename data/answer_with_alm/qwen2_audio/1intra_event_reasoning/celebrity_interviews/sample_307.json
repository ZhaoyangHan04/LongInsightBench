    "model_answer": "The reason for Meghan Markle choosing a black dress between 00:03:47.963 and 00:04:06.440 is uncertain from the provided subtitles alone. However, option A seems like the most likely explanation, as it aligns with the context of the event and the commentary from a stylist about dressing to complement the bride and groom without stealing the spotlight. The footage also seems to support this interpretation by showing other guests in brighter colors that would attract more attention, while Meghan's dress appears to be more understated in comparison.",

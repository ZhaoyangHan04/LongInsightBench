    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on film and television for help. There is no mention of Ryan Gosling in the provided excerpt, so option B is unlikely. Option C is also less likely because it does not explain the timing of the cutaway. Option A is plausible as it could be a scene where the speaker is acknowledging her husband in the audience. However, without additional context, we cannot confirm this. Therefore, the most likely answer is D: The next presenter is being introduced from his seat.\n\nAnswer: D: The next presenter is being introduced from his seat.",

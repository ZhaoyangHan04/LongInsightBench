    "model_answer": "Answer: A: On-screen text shows “OLGA KURylenko” and “3RD JUNE 2013,” while the host audibly introduces her and mentions the second season of Magic City starting on Stars.\nExplanation: The combination of on-screen text with Olga Kurylenko's name and the mention of the premiere date and show name on the relevant network (Stars) indicates that she is the guest being promoted. The host's verbal introduction further confirms this. Options B, C, and D do not provide sufficient visual or auditory cues to identify the guest or promote an event.",

    "model_answer": "Option A: On-screen text reads “The End Outro Coming…” as the host leans in to kiss the guest on the cheek, and the audio abruptly shifts from their exchange to an energetic ad line followed by a garage rock song that continues through the rest of the clip.\nThis indicates that the interview is coming to an end and the show is transitioning into the outro. The on-screen text and the change in music style suggest that the final segment of the show is beginning. Additionally, the fact that the audio abruptly shifts to the ad line and garage rock song implies that the transition is seamless and dramatic.",

    "model_answer": "The interviewer concludes that sound matters more than looks because despite the guitar looking visually unappealing, it sounds amazing and is his main '63 Stratocaster. This is evident from the conversation where the focus is on the guitar's sound quality rather than its appearance. The fact that the guitarist values the sound over the look suggests that he believes the value of an instrument lies in its ability to produce good music, not just its visual appeal.",

    "model_answer": "Based on the segment, option A best supports the conclusion that the upcoming show will be guided by feeling rather than a fixed plan. The speaker explicitly states their intention to play what they feel today and not play the same way, which implies an emphasis on spontaneity and personal expression over following a pre-determined setlist. Additionally, the visual of a live stage with lights and smoke suggests an anticipation of a dynamic and possibly improvised performance.",

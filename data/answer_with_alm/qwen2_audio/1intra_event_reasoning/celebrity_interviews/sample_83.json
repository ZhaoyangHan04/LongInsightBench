This caution could stem from a variety of reasons, such as personal preference, dietary restrictions, or concerns about hygiene. The other participant's response, advising on cleaning football gloves, appears to be a practical suggestion related to maintaining hygiene, which may have been prompted by the conversation about food and drinks.",

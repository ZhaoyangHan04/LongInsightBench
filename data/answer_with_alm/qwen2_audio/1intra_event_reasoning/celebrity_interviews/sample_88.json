    "model_answer": "Option A seems like the most likely answer. The text \"MOVING ON BTS (BANGTAN BOYS)\" is displayed during a segment discussing the members' living situations, which is relevant to the news about RM and Jimin's purchase of apartments. This could suggest a thematic connection between the group's music and their personal lives, as well as a nod to their recent success and growth. Additionally, the casual setting with the members in cozy clothing might be meant to emphasize that, despite their fame and wealth, they still maintain a relatable and down-to-earth image.",

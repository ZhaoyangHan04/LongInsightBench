    "model_answer": "Option B seems like the most likely answer based on the provided excerpt. The clip mentions that the Duchess of Sussex has been busy with work during the pandemic, which suggests that she may have put off having another baby. However, it also states that she and Prince Harry have been bonding over the pandemic, which could indicate that they are considering starting a family again. The mention of the lab equipment and health officer's briefing could be additional details related to the pandemic, but they do not seem central to the connection between the discussion of trying for a second baby and the pandemic context. Option D, a formal royal ceremony, is unrelated to the topic of trying for a second baby.",

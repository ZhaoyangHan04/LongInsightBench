    "model_answer": "Answer: A: By applying the handbrake, chocking the wheels, lowering the jockey wheel, and winding down the four corner support legsâ€”demonstrated as he uses the yellow jack to stabilize.\n\nThe presenter demonstrates how to achieve on-site stability and leveling of the trailer using the following steps:\n\n1. Applying the handbrake: This helps to stop the movement of the trailer, ensuring that it remains stationary while adjustments are made.\n2. Choking the wheels: This involves engaging the parking brake on each wheel, which prevents them from rolling while the trailer is being moved or adjusted.\n3. Lowering the jockey wheel: The jockey wheel is a small wheel at the front of the trailer that allows it to be lowered or raised. In this case, the jockey wheel is lowered to help stabilize the trailer.\n4. Winding down the four corner support legs: These are the legs at the corners of the trailer that provide additional support and stability. By winding these legs down, the trailer becomes more stable and level.\n\nThese steps, when performed correctly, should help to stabilize and level the trailer on-site.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Unlatching the boat loader rack and using winches attached to anchor points to move sections. This is because the description mentions that the trailer sections are raised and lowered using winches attached to anchor points, which implies that the first step would be to unlatch the boat loader rack. The other options do not match the described process.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: To prevent accidental filling of the black tank—which could back up into the toilet if the black tank lever isn’t pulled—while the video shows him detaching the green hose from the caution-labeled fitting.\nIn the provided excerpt, the demonstrator is completing the process of emptying the black tank by flushing it. After the flush, he removes the green hose from the caution-labeled fitting to prevent any accidental filling of the black tank while he is working on other parts of the system. This action is necessary because if the black tank lever isn't pulled, the black tank can fill up with waste, potentially causing a backup in the toilet. The video shows him repeatedly attaching and removing this same hose at the flush fitting throughout the demonstration.",

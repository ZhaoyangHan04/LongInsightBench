    "model_answer": "Answer: C: Because their fresh water ran out and only the truck can transport water to refill the tank.\nThe speaker mentions that they have to work and this was not a planned situation, indicating that they likely did not anticipate running out of fresh water. Since they cannot use the campsite's facilities, they need to find another place to stay and obtain water before returning to the campsite. The fact that they are using a truck to transport water implies that they have a limited option for obtaining it, making option (C) the most likely answer.",

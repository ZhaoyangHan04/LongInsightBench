To achieve this, the individuals laid a thick spruce-bough \"bath mat\" made from old logs under the tent floor. This would help insulate the floor and keep it warmer. Additionally, the use of an orange axe suggests that they may have been cutting wood, which could be part of constructing the bath mat or other insulation materials.",

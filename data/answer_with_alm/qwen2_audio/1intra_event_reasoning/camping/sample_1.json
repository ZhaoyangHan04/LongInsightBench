    "model_answer": "Based on the audio, the driver seems to have had a mixed experience at the campground. While he enjoyed the quietness and the beauty of the place, he also found it crowded and was bothered by the noise from the nearby drone. Therefore, option B, which states that he enjoyed parts of the stay but found it too crowded and isn’t sure he’d return, is the most likely conclusion.",

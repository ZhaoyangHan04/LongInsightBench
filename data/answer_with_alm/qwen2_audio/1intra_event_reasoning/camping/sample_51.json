This indicates that he has secured the shelter properly to create a tight setup despite having limited stakes. The other options may help in creating a shelter but are not directly supported by the provided scene description.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are A and D. He runs a loop and creates a loop jam through the center tie-out loop, using a toggle before tightening. This method helps in establishing and tensioning the ridgeline for the A-frame setup. Additionally, he stakes the four corners first before setting any ridgeline, which serves as a visual cue that he is preparing the tarp.",

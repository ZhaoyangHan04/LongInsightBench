The video also shows a post labeled \"19\" at a lakeside site with a fire pit, which confirms that this is the campsite they stayed at. Additionally, a campground map is shown highlighting site 19, further confirming their choice. The presence of a reservation receipt on camera also supports the fact that they had reserved site 19.",

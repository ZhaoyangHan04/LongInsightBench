    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: To form a dome on top rather than a sagging \"dish,\" establishing the frame before the side poles go in.\nExplanation: Sliding the roof poles through the tunnels in a crisscross pattern creates a sturdy framework for the tent before adding the side poles. This method helps ensure that the structure is square and stable, which is essential for maintaining a dome shape rather than a flat, sagging \"dish.\" Additionally, this technique allows for quicker and easier installation of the side poles since they are being placed into pre-existing channels created by the roof poles.",

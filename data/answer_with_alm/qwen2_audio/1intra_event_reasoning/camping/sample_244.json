    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Because the area is mostly bedrock with a drainage point nearby, and flood debris shows high water washed material down into that hole.\nThe speaker mentions that the gold is usually found in crevices and along drainages, indicating that the area near the drainage point is likely a good spot to look for gold because it receives a lot of water and therefore carries sediments and potential gold deposits. The presence of bedrock also suggests that the soil in this area is less likely to impede the flow of water and gold particles.",

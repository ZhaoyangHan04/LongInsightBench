    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: He says he won’t publicly broadcast the location and provides an email for directions, while the video shows his small white dog walking a leaf-covered trail as footsteps crunch.\n\nThis combination of audio-visual cues indicates that the speaker is trying to keep the location private while going for a walk with his dog. The fact that he mentions providing directions via email instead of sharing the location publicly suggests that he wants to maintain its privacy. Additionally, the visual of his small white dog walking a leaf-covered trail as footsteps crunch reinforces this idea, as it creates a sense of intimacy and seclusion.",

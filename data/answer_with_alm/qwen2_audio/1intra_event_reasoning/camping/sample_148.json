    "model_answer": "Based on the visual of rice boiling over a fire and the spoken words 'we have curry starting to bubble,' it can be concluded that option A, rice and curry prepared for two people, is the most likely answer. The phrase 'starting to bubble' implies that the dish is in the early stages of cooking, which typically involves boiling water for rice and preparing spices like curry. Additionally, the use of the word 'we' suggests that the meal is intended for more than one person. However, without additional context, it's impossible to determine the exact amount of food being cooked.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: He wants to avoid doing it in the morning, and he is shown opening a hatch, handling ropes, and exerting himself (“heave”) while organizing gear on deck despite the wind.\n\nThe audio indicates that the speaker prefers to work on the sail at night because it is cooler and less crowded. This preference is conveyed through his statement, \"I prefer to work on the sail at night when it's cooler and less crowded.\" To support this preference, the audio shows the speaker opening a hatch, handling ropes, and exerting himself while organizing gear on deck despite the wind. These actions suggest that he is actively preparing for sailing, even though it is dark and less convenient. Therefore, option A best explains the speaker's decision to work on the sail at night and the actions showing this preparation.",

While digging, they accidentally dug themselves into the sand up to their necks. They then decided to take a break and head back to the boat. Therefore, the correct answer is C: On a cloudy beach, the group—including a woman and two children—dug together, were shown buried up to their necks, and then decided to head back to the boat.",

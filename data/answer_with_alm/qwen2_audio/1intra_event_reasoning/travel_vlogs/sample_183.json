    "model_answer": "The presenters demonstrate the correct way to pay and prepare for boarding the Gautrain by using the ticket machine to select a destination and payment method, insert a card (with the screen showing a fare and a transaction sound), then proceed past the turnstiles toward the escalator while explaining to 'tap it in, tap it out' which is supported visually by the on-screen instructions and the sound of the card being inserted and the fare being displayed.

There's no mention of paying cash, generating a mobile barcode, or buying paper tickets in the provided audio and visual content.",

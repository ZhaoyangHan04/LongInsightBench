    "model_answer": "The close-up of the small window labeled “Escape hatch” along with the speaker's explanation indicates that it is designed to remain sealed during normal conditions and be broken in an emergency rather than opened. This means that in case of an emergency, passengers or crew members would need to break this hatch open to escape, implying it is not meant for regular access or as a ventilation port. Therefore, option A correctly describes the function of the hatch.",

    "model_answer": "The most likely answer is D: Because the compartment is actually for lifejackets, and the boots were mistakenly stored there, causing confusion. This would explain why the speaker is unsure which shoes are his when stepping on board, as the usual存放 location for shoes would be different from where they were found.",

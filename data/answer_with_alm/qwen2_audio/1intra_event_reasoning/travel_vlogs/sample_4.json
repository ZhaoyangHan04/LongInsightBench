    "model_answer": "Based on the audio description provided, the most likely answer is A: They notice the “TX Peach Berry Smash” cocktail sign and react with approving sounds, then chat about Cheez-Its as “best friend cheeset buddies” while in a dim hotel room with food visible. This option aligns with the mention of seeing a cocktail sign, discussing food and drinks like Cheez-Its, and being in a quiet hotel room. The other options either don't mention the hotel setting or describe actions that don't fit the context provided in the audio.",

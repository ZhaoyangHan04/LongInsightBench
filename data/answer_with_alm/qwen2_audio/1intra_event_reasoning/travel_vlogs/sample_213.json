    "model_answer": "A: He says it’s a “loud place to ride a bike,” and the visuals show a bustling street and an active construction site with workers and equipment.\n\nAnswer: The speaker refers to New York City as a 'loud place to ride a bike' due to the heavy traffic, chaos, and noise that are typical of this city. The audio includes sounds such as bicycle chains moving and close-ups of a bike-share keypad, which also contribute to the bustling environment.",

    "model_answer": "The observations that support the claim are A and B. The speaker mentions that the waterfront was designed for both recreation and resilience by using environmentally friendly design to prepare for rising sea levels, and there is a mention of a \"little greenway\" created for safe access to the Queensboro Bridge. The visuals also show a winding path by the river and the bridge in the skyline, which could be used for recreational activities. Option C does not directly relate to the design of the waterfront, and option D only mentions seeing someone with a surfboard, which does not necessarily indicate that the area is designed for recreation.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: To provide supplemental oxygen for the rider at extreme altitude during the planned world-record stunt show.\n\nExplanation: In the provided excerpt, the rider can be heard explaining his plan, and specifically mentions the need for an oxygen tank. This indicates that the tank is necessary for the rider to breathe properly at high altitudes, which could be required for the planned world-record stunt.

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Because after years in a cold country he appreciates sunshine, which is reinforced by cuts from rainy and snowy street scenes to sunlit ocean and balcony shots with him standing arms outstretched.\nThe audio mentions that the speaker moved to a sunny country because he missed it after living in a cold country for many years. This is evident from the contrast between the cold, rainy, and snowy scenes in the beginning of the clip and the warm, sunny scenes later on. The cuts also show the speaker enjoying the warmth of the sun on a balcony and by the ocean, further emphasizing his appreciation for sunshine. Therefore, option A is the most likely correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "The most appropriate answer would be A: She crouches to check the rear tire with a tool while explaining essential systems like the spare tire, propane/LP, electrical hookup, and the wastewater dump tank. This action indicates that she is actively preparing the van for travel readiness by ensuring all necessary components are functioning properly. The other options describe actions related to either fixing a flat tire (option B) or transporting a pet (option C), which are not necessarily indicative of active preparation for travel. Option D does not seem relevant to the topic of preparing a van for travel.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: She says sheâ€™s meeting Chris and G in a parking lot in Tucson, and the visuals show her outside beside her Roadtrek 170 with other vehicles visible.\n\nThis statement directly confirms that the location of the introduction is indeed a parking lot in Tucson, where Julie is meeting Chris and G. Additionally, the visual elements of the video further support this conclusion by showing Julie standing outside the Roadtrek 170, surrounded by other vehicles. Options B, C, and D either do not specify the location or do not provide sufficient context to confirm the parking-lot setting.",

    "model_answer": "Based on the conversation between Zidane and Zack, we can infer that Zidane initially wants to buy the Minions-themed binder for Zack but then decides against it because he doesn't want to spend too much money. Zidane also mentions that he doesn't really like Minions anymore, which suggests that he may have reconsidered his purchase.

    "model_answer": "The on-screen “14,259 FEET (4346 M)” refers to the elevation gain that the riders need to climb during their bike ride. They joke about this by saying they have '30 more donuts' left to reach the top, which implies that they are close to completing their journey but still have some physical challenge ahead.",

This is indicated by him saying out loud what the prompt should be, and the screen showing the new prompt. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

    "model_answer": "The user doesn't directly ask the AI for suggestions on how to achieve a concise yet satisfying orchestral chord progression. Instead, the user provides context by mentioning that they have been experimenting with AI and are looking for ways to use it creatively. The AI responds with a long explanation, which the user then divides into shorter segments and asks for more details on each segment. This process continues until the user is satisfied with the resulting chord progression suggestions. Therefore, the correct answer would be A: By repeatedly asking the AI to shorten its explanation and then requesting a tiny bit more detail, which matches his spoken instructions and the progressively briefer on-screen replies.",

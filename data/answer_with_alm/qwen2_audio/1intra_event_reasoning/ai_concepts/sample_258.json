    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Mobile and digital customers increased, agent contact rate declined, and e-statement penetration rose—indicating customers are using more digital self-service channels.\nThe narration mentions that mobile and digital customers increased, which aligns with the first graph showing a rise in these categories. The second graph indicates a decline in agent contact rate, which supports the notion that customers are choosing self-service channels over interacting with agents. Additionally, the third graph shows an increase in e-statement penetration, suggesting that customers are opting for digital statements instead of paper statements. Therefore, all three graphs support the conclusion that digital adoption at Citibank led to an increase in mobile and digital customers, a decrease in agent contact rate, and a rise in e-statement penetration.",

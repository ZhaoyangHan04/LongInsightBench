This showcases GPT-4's ability to integrate various knowledge domains, such as mathematics and literature, and present them in a coherent and engaging manner.",

    "model_answer": "The segment invites the viewer to conclude that GPT-4's abilities are extraordinary and challenging our ideas about learning, cognition, and the nature of intelligence. This conclusion is supported by the narrator's statement that GPT-4's capabilities are surpassing expectations and by the on-screen visuals of GPT-4 passing cognitive tests that young children typically perform well in. The visual also challenges our ideas about what constitutes intelligence. Therefore, the correct answer would be D: There is a striking paradox: despite being a next-word predictor, GPT-4 can pass psychological tests that young children pass, raising questions about how such abilities emerge.",

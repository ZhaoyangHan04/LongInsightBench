In the first diagram, the MRN is used to synthesize a binary classifier, which means it needs to map input data into just two classes. Therefore, it's implemented as an MLP (multi-layer perceptron). However, in the second diagram, the MRN is used to classify images into multiple categories, so it needs to be able to distinguish between more than two classes. Therefore, it's implemented as a six-layer FCN (fully convolutional network).\n\nThe training objective shown on the following slide is likely related to minimizing the difference between the real classifier parameters and the ones generated by the MRN. This is done using the L_reg loss function, which measures the Euclidean distance between the two sets of parameters. The goal is to find the set of parameters that results in the lowest possible L_reg value, which indicates that the",

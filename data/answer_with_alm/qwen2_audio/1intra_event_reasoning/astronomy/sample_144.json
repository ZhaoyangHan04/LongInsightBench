    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: It shows the corona in extreme ultraviolet above the photosphere, revealing loops and patterns not visible in the photospheric (yellow) view.\nThe reason for this difference is that the Sun's atmosphere can be observed at different wavelengths to reveal different features. The yellow view is likely from a photosphere, which is the visible surface of the Sun, while the brown/orange view is probably from the corona, which is the outer atmosphere of the Sun. The corona is much hotter than the photosphere and can emit light at longer wavelengths such as extreme ultraviolet (EUV). This allows us to see details that are not visible in the photosphere, such as loops and patterns in the magnetic field.",

    "model_answer": "Based on the provided excerpt, we cannot definitively conclude the nature of the dark area labeled 'AR 12573' and its relation to the nearby sunspots. We only know that it is highlighted within a sunspot analysis tool, along with other features like sunspots themselves. Therefore, the correct answer would be either C (the on-screen label is merely a user-added marker) or D (in visible light, sunspots indicate strong magnetic fields).",

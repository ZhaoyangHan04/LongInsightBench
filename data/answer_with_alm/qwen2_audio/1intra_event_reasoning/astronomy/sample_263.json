    "model_answer": "The most likely answer is C: By using a Personal Solar Telescope (PST), a 40 mm refractor, with a solar filter to show the Sun as a red disk. This type of telescope is designed specifically for observing the Sun and comes with specialized filters to protect the viewer's eyes from the intense brightness of the Sun. Using a standard telescope without a filter would be dangerous, as it could cause permanent damage to the eyes. Filming the Sun with a regular camera and tinting the video red would also not accurately reflect the appearance of the Sun in the sky. Aligning a red laser on the telescope to simulate the Sunâ€™s position would not provide a clear view of the Sun itself.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Penzias and Wilson accidentally discovered the cosmic background radiation with a horn antenna, and COBE measured a spectrum matching a 2.73 K blackbody.\nThe audio describes how Penzias and Wilson observed a residual noise in the horn antenna's signal, which they initially thought was due to errors in their equipment. However, upon further investigation, they realized that this noise was a均匀 and isotropic background radiation filling the universe. This discovery led them to propose the existence of the cosmic background radiation, which was later confirmed by other experiments, including COBE.\nThe COBE mission, launched in 1989, aimed to measure the cosmic background radiation's spectrum and its temperature, which was found to be approximately 2.73 K, consistent with the prediction made by Penzias and Wilson. Therefore, the combination of the audio's narration and the visual aids provided in the segment support the conclusion that the cosmic background radiation was discovered by Penzias and Wilson with the horn antenna and later confirmed by COBE.",

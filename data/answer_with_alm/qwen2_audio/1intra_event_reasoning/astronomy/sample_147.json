    "model_answer": "Answer: A, B, D\n\nThe audio describes that dark energy causes galaxies to move away from each other, making up about seventy percent of the universe, and it also emphasizes that its nature is still mysterious. The on-screen visuals likely reinforce these points by showing visual representations of the expansion of the universe and the amount of dark energy involved. Option C, stating that dark energy is well-understood, is not supported by either the narration or the visuals.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because space itself is expanding, so the farther a galaxy is, the faster it recedes — this relationship is known as Hubble’s Law. \n\nAccording to the audio, Hubble's Law states that light from distant galaxies appears to be redshifted, indicating that these galaxies are moving away from us at increasing speeds. This speed increase is due to the expansion of the universe, which causes galaxies to move further away from us over time. The greater the distance between a galaxy and Earth, the stronger the redshift will be, indicating that the galaxy is moving away at a faster rate.",

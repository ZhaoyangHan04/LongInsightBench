    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Because atmospheric noise is random and lower at the South Pole, reducing interference; the clear outdoor sky and focus on the station contextualize the favorable observing environment seen before the control-room cut.\nThe statement implies that the quality of the spectrum in the control room improved due to several factors. Firstly, the low levels of atmospheric noise at the South Pole reduce interference, which usually degrades the clarity of astronomical observations. Secondly, the clear outdoor sky provides an ideal backdrop for the station, enhancing visibility and allowing for better focusing. Lastly, the context of the control room suggests that the improvements are directly related to the favorable conditions outside, likely leading to clearer and more precise readings through the telescope.",

    "model_answer": "The explosion in the clip represents option C: a supernova of an isolated massive star, not tied to ring buildup around the galactic center. The sequence leading up to the explosion involves the accumulation of material around a massive star, which eventually leads to its collapse and explosion as a supernova. This process is separate from the formation of a gas ring around the galactic center, which is described in option A.",

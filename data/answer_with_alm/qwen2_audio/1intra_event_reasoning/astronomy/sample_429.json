    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The slideâ€™s caption and credits visually indicate interacting/distant galaxies with NASA/ESA/Hubble Heritage listed, while the speaker explicitly says the two spiral galaxies are colliding/merging and that Hubble took the picture.\n\nThe speaker mentions that the two spiral galaxies are colliding or merging, which is supported by the visual evidence provided in the slide's caption and credits. Additionally, the fact that the images were taken by the Hubble Space Telescope are also clearly indicated. Therefore, option A provides the most accurate and complete information to support the presenter's claim. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the presence of the earlier book cover does not necessarily mean that all the images in the slide are from the Hubble Space Telescope. Option C is incorrect because the statement about light taking hundreds of millions of years to reach us does not directly relate to the fact that the images in the slide show interacting spiral galaxies. Option D is incorrect because there is no mention of a live telescope feed in the audio or the slide.",

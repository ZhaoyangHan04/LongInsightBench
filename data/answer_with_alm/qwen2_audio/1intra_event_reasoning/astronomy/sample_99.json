    "model_answer": "The shifts in the diagrams of stellar spectra between 00:02:52.705 and 00:03:38.412 indicate that the stars are moving toward and away from us (blue/red shifts). The speaker explained that this method cannot detect tangential motion, meaning that the stars' sideways speeds cannot be measured. Therefore, the correct answer is B: They indicate changes in the starsâ€™ sideways speeds, so the shifts measure tangential motion while radial motion cannot be measured.",

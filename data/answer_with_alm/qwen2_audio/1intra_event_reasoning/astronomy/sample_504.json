    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: To fine-tune camera focus on an unnamed bright star.\n\nExplanation: In the audio, the speaker mentions that before any planetary session, they columnate the telescope, especially when working at high focal lengths. The purpose of this practice is to ensure accurate alignment and focusing of the camera on the target celestial object. In this specific scenario, the speaker intends to use a bright star, which is most likely Alpha Centauri, as a reference point to check the collimation of their telescope. By making the star appear as a 'donut' on the laptop screen, they can visually inspect the circular shape of the image and adjust the camera settings accordingly to achieve proper focus.",

It emphasizes that this discovery is significant because it allows us to observe and study cosmic events that were previously undetectable through traditional means. This includes events like the collision of black holes, which cannot be observed directly.",

    "model_answer": "The segment substantiates its claim by providing a variety of visual examples from our solar system that showcase the diverse and intricate features found within it. These include details about Jupiter's bands and storms, Pluto's icy landscapes, Neptune's specific stats, Saturn's ice rings, and Mars' towering Olympus Mons. This presentation helps to illustrate the idea that the solar system is a small-scale representation of the larger, cosmic wonders that exist beyond our own planetary system. Therefore, option A best supports this argument.",

    "model_answer": "The most likely reason is option A: because follow-up observations confirmed the initially suspected worlds and revealed additional planets, expanding the count from three to seven. This would be a common occurrence in astronomy, where initial discoveries are followed by further observations that reveal more details about the system.",

    "model_answer": "The space telescope image appears between 00:06:22.977 and 00:06:28.137, which means it falls within the time frame mentioned in the question (00:05:50.137 to 00:06:37.285). Therefore, option B, which states that the colorful, geothermal-looking landscape shown next is an actual image captured by this telescope, seems like the most likely answer. This would support the speaker's point about the TRAPPIST-1 planets being studied by the James Webb Space Telescope.",

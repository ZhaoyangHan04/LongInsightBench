    "model_answer": "The answer is A: By adaptive optics that use pistons behind the mirror to correct for atmospheric blurring.\nAdaptive optics is a technology used by telescopes to correct for the distortions caused by the Earth's atmosphere. It works by using a system of mirrors and lenses behind the main mirror of the telescope to adjust the position of the image on the detector (usually a CCD) in real-time. This allows the telescope to maintain a clear and sharp image despite the constantly changing conditions in the atmosphere.\nIn the case of the Very Large Telescope in Chile, the adaptive optics system uses a set of 128 small mirrors called deformable mirrors located behind the main mirror. These mirrors can move independently to compensate for the effects of the atmosphere on the incoming light, resulting in a much clearer and sharper image of the object being observed.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Early stars often formed in sudden, intense episodes rather than through a smooth, steady process.\nThe visuals in the segment show a rapid change from mapped star systems and colorful nebulae to a rocky orange-lit landscape and a blue ringed planet, which suggests that the formation of these celestial bodies was not a gradual process but occurred in sudden, intense episodes. Additionally, the narration mentions the use of supercomputers to model galaxy formation and the discovery of \"bursty star formation,\" which challenges established ideas about how stars form. This further supports the idea that early star formation was likely characterized by bursts of activity rather than a continuous, slow process.",

    "model_answer": "The key inference supported by the segment is option A: Ancient galaxies produced fewer heavy elements than models predicted, indicating a break in the expected relation between star formation, mass, and chemistry. This implies that there was a deviation from the standard model of how galaxies form and evolve, leading to differences in the chemical composition of these early systems compared to what we observe today.",

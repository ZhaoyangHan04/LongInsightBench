    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because interstellar dust obscures the star, so space-based imaging is needed to reveal it even though itâ€™s intrinsically very bright.\n\nIn the provided segment, the narrator mentions that the Pistol Star would be a fourth-magnitude object to the naked eye if not for the dust. This implies that the star is faint in visible light due to the presence of interstellar dust. Since space-based telescopes are not affected by dust, they can capture images of this star more clearly than ground-based telescopes. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Pistol Star is not a planet but a normal star. Option C is incorrect because the Earth's rotation does not affect the visibility of the Pistol Star. Option D is incorrect because the sequence is not a real observational data but rather a conceptual illustration.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: To connect Galileoâ€™s Pisa-associated gravity experiment and his conclusion that objects fall at the same speed with a modern space-mission context shown on the screen.\nThe Leaning Tower of Pisa is often associated with Galileo Galilei's experiments on free fall, which he conducted in the tower in the early 17th century. The image of the tower alongside a large screen with mission-control captions likely serves to illustrate the connection between Galileo's work and contemporary space exploration missions, highlighting how scientific discoveries from the past continue to influence modern technology and research.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on radio astronomy for help. The spike is most likely caused by a fast radio burst (FRB), which are intense bursts of radio waves that last only milliseconds and originate from galaxies far beyond our Milky Way. These bursts are not related to terrestrial interference.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

    "model_answer": "The answer should be supported by evidence from the audio. In this case, we refer to the description in the audio where the speaker mentions 'the diagonal' on the graph and its relation to the arrival times of different frequency radio waves. This supports option A as it describes the physical phenomenon of dispersion in radio waves while traveling through plasma, which causes lower-frequency waves to arrive later than higher-frequency ones. Option B, C, and D are not directly related to the graph's diagonal feature and its implications for the burst's origin.",

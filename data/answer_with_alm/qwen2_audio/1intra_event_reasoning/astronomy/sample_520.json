    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Because the Sun’s and the Galaxy’s gravity only capture it temporarily, after a few laps—or even part of one—the Sun slingsshots it back into interstellar space with added energy.\nThe passage states that the interstellar object is captured by the Sun's gravity and enters into a orbit around the Sun. However, due to the gravitational forces between the Sun and the Milky Way, the object will eventually be sling-shotted back out into interstellar space with increased velocity. This means that the object cannot settle into a permanent orbit around the Sun.",

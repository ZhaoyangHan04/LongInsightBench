    "model_answer": "A: Because the combined gravitational pulls of Earth and the Sun shape its looping path, reinforced by shots of an object orbiting a cratered body, Earth with its Moon, and Earth shown near the Sun.\nThe speaker describes Kamo'oalewa's path as a \"corkscrew-like trajectory\" due to the gravitational pull between the Earth and the Sun influencing its orbit. The visual aids provided in the form of images of objects orbiting a cratered body, Earth with its Moon, and Earth near the Sun help to reinforce this explanation by showing how these celestial bodies' orbits are shaped by their mutual gravitational attraction.",

    "model_answer": "The segment invites the conclusion that Kamo'oalewa could be a fragment of the Moon, as suggested by the discussion of lunar silicates and reinforced by multiple Moon- and Earth-Moon shots. This conclusion is supported by the imagery showing the presence of similar materials on Kamo'oalewa and the Moon. The other options, such as Kamo'oalewa being caused by Earth's ocean tides or orbiting Jupiter, are not supported by the provided information in the audio and visual content.",

    "model_answer": "The video alternates between views labeled “Infrared” and “Visible” of the same nebula to show that Hubble can peer through thick dust in star-forming regions using infrared while visible light reveals the illuminated pillars and surrounding stars, giving a fuller picture of stellar birth. This contrast highlights the unique capabilities of Hubble in observing different wavelengths of light to gain insights into the universe's mysteries. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

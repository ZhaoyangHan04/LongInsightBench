This is supported by a visual display showing a black hole with a glowing accretion disk and polar beams, which illustrates the intense gravitational forces at work in such systems. The other answer choices do not accurately reflect the significance of a pulsar-black hole binary for testing relativity.",

The speaker was influenced by Elizabeth Jennings's poem \"Delay\", which led her to start collecting astronomy-themed poetry. A blue sphere visual aids in emphasizing the concept of time delay in astronomy during the segment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

    "model_answer": "The purpose of the build is to expand the existing EISCAT UHF system by adding more and larger mechanically steered dishes so the beam can be widened without changing the measurement principle. The limitation aimed to overcome is the current radars' limited field-of-view described as a “long beam pencil” into the ionosphere. Option B correctly identifies the purpose and the limitation of the build.",

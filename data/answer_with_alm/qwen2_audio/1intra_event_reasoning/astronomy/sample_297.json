    "model_answer": "The correct statement explaining why the mechanism is mounted outdoors and how the stopping mechanism works is option B: A half-meter piece mounted with angled aluminum on the roof trips a sensor to stop overruns, and the close-up shows a saw blade/cog component that drives the motion. This option accurately describes the mechanism's outdoor installation and its stopping mechanism, which relies on a sensor and a saw blade/cog component to prevent overruns. The other options either do not address the outdoor installation or describe incorrect components or mechanisms.",

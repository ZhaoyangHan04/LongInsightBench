    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because iron’s extremely stable nucleus yields no usable energy, so the core can’t extract energy and starts losing it.\nIn stars, nuclear fusion reactions occur in which hydrogen nuclei combine to form helium nuclei, releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the process. However, when a star's hydrogen fuel supply runs out, it can no longer sustain these fusion reactions, and its core begins to collapse under its own gravity. As the core collapses, it becomes increasingly hot and dense, eventually reaching temperatures and pressures high enough to initiate nuclear fusion reactions involving heavier elements like iron.\nHowever, unlike hydrogen, which can undergo fusion at relatively low temperatures and pressures, iron cannot undergo fusion without extreme conditions. Iron's nucleus is so stable that it requires an enormous amount of energy input to overcome its electrostatic repulsion and initiate a fusion reaction. This makes it extremely difficult for a star to convert iron into energy through fusion, leading to the end of its life as it expands and cools, ultimately becoming a red giant or white dwarf.",

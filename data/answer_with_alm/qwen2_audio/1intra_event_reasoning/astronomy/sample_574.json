    "model_answer": "Option A supports the conclusion that astronauts were traveling much faster relative to the Sun than to the Earth-Moon system. The video mentions that in three days, the Earth-Moon system moves about 4.8-5 million miles around the Sun, which is significantly greater than the distance traveled by the spacecraft during the Apollo missions. This implies that the astronauts were traveling much faster relative to the Sun than to the Earth-Moon system.",

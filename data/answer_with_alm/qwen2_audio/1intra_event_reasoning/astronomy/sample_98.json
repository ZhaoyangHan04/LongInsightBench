    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: He says our own eye optics (retina/eyelashes) create the spikes; he shows a close-up of his eye and then uses a phone flashlight/the Sun to make spikes appear.\n\nThe speaker explains that the spikes we see in drawings and paintings are actually created by our own eye optics, specifically the retina and eyelashes. He supports this by showing a close-up of his eye and demonstrating the spikes that appear when he shines a phone flashlight or the Sun into it. This indicates that the visual effect is not due to the telescope itself but rather the interaction between light and our eyes.",

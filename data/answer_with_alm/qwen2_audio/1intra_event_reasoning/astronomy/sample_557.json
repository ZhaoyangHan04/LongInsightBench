    "model_answer": "Answer: A: They are interstellar dust blocking light—the building blocks of new stars—and the later cut to an observatory dome underscores the observational/photographic context.\nThe dark streaks in the Milky Way band appear due to the presence of interstellar dust, which blocks the light from distant stars passing through it. This is discussed in relation to actual observed imagery when the scene cuts to an observatory dome, indicating that the visual effects shown are based on real-world observations.",

    "model_answer": "D: The video overlays show timestamps such as “1.3Myr” through “4.1Myr,” indicating the simulation spans millions of years.\n\nThe video provides time overlays showing the duration of the simulation, which helps us understand the timescale of the events being modelled. Therefore, option D is correct.",

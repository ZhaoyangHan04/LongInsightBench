    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: It visually foreshadows the “ancient rivers” mentioned by the narrator, implying flowing water once sculpted the Martian surface textures seen afterward.\nThe sequence starts with turbulent water, suggesting movement and fluidity, which transitions to images of Martian terrain. This juxtaposition implies that the water was once present on Mars and played a role in shaping its surface features, which aligns with the idea of ancient rivers on the planet. The subsequent display of the terrain could serve to emphasize the geologic changes caused by these rivers over time.",

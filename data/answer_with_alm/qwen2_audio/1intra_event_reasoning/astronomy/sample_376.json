This is likely due to the fact that Australia will experience a partial eclipse during this time, which means that people in certain parts of the country will be able to witness the moon passing in front of the sun. The narrator is also joking about how even kangaroos might enjoy the eclipse since they are native to Australia and would be able to see it happening in their own backyard.",

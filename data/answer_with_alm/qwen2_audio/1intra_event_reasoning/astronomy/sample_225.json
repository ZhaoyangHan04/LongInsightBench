The pictures of Johannes Kepler and the book “Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica” are shown because they represent the foundation of modern astronomy, which helped shaped our understanding of the solar system's behavior over time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

    "model_answer": "The presenter highlights that Jupiter's early inward excursion helps explain several outcomes, including:\n\nA: Mars's relatively low mass.\nB: The asteroid belt's limited total mass.\nC: Earth and Saturn switching places.\n\nJupiter's inward excursion led to the gravitational scattering of smaller bodies like asteroids and comets, which in turn reduced the size of the asteroid belt and allowed Mars to accrete most of its mass. This also led to the formation of the terrestrial planets, including Earth, by capturing material from the surrounding disk. Additionally, the inward movement of Jupiter caused it to swap positions with Saturn, which then moved outward, explaining the current arrangement of the outer planets in the solar system. However, the presenter does not mention that the inner Solar System remained static as an outcome of Jupiter's early inward excursion.",

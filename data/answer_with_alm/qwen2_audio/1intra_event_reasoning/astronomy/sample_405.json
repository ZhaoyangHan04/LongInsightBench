    "model_answer": "The purpose of the M1-M2 diagram with arrows F1 and F2 and the equation shown is to introduce the concept of Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation, which states that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This law sets up the framework for comparing gravitational acceleration across different planets. The subsequent lineup of planets labeled with G and a likely refers to the use of these symbols to denote the gravitational acceleration of each planet relative to Earth, using standard units of measurement (m/s^2). Therefore, the correct option would be A: It introduces Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation—showing that two masses exert equal forces on each other—which sets up the forthcoming comparison of gravitational acceleration across different planets.",

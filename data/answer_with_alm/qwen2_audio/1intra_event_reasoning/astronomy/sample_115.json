    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: To illustrate how a lens-like object bends light and distorts images by varying amounts with distanceâ€”an analogy for weak gravitational lensing that the survey analyzes.\n\nIn the provided excerpt, the presenter is likely using the wine glass as a visual aid to help explain a complex scientific concept related to the Dark Energy Survey. By holding up the glass and demonstrating how it distorts light, the presenter can convey how similar effects occur in the universe when light travels through space and interacts with massive objects like galaxies. This helps make the concept more accessible and easier to understand for viewers who may not have a background in astronomy or physics.",

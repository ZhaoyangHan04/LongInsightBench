    "model_answer": "Based on the provided subtitles, option A seems to be the most likely answer. The speaker mentions that the on-screen images represent \"self-annihilation signals,\" which suggests they are related to the concept of dark matter self-annihilation. However, the speaker also states \"no\" before these images, which could indicate that despite the simulations showing where gamma radiation from dark matter self-annihilation should be strongest, no such signals have been confirmed observationally. This aligns with option A's statement that the signals are not confirmed.",

The speaker also notes that this is a significant visual change, although not necessarily a dramatic one.",

    "model_answer": "The mechanism causing the Moon's rotation to match its orbital period is through gravitational forces between the Earth and Moon. As the Moon orbits around the Earth, it experiences tidal forces that cause a bulge to appear on the side facing us (the nearside) and another bulge on the far side. The Moon's rotation is gradually slowed down by these tidal forces until it matches its orbital period, which takes about 29.5 days. This process is also responsible for making the tides on Earth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A): Earth’s gravity raised a tidal bulge on the Moon that, when pulled back, slowed its rotation until locked; Earth’s rotation is slowing and could become tidally locked to the Moon in about 50 billion years.",

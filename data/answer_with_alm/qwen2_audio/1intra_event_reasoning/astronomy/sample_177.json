The presenter multiplies the angle difference by 71, which gives him approximately 20 degrees, and then rounds this value to 600 AD. Finally, he subtracts the present era from this value to arrive at about 580 AD. This shows that the presenter has used both historical knowledge and mathematical calculations to arrive at his conclusion.",

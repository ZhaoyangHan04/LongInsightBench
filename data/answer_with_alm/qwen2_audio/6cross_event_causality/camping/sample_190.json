    "model_answer": "The most direct condition leading to the camper deciding to leave early in event 7 was event 1: He saw a red “DANGER MOD RANGE” sign on a fence and therefore decides the area is unsafe, so he plans to leave early. This event made the camper realize the potential danger and urgency of the situation, leading him to make the decision to leave early. The other events may have contributed to the decision, but they were not the direct cause.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible factor causing the camper to secure the tent in event 3 is option A: Events 0, 1, and 2 together. The audio mentions that the wind is blowing and may shift, making the tent unstable. Later, the camper finds himself on exposed hills near sunset, which increases the risk of the tent being blown away. Finally, when unexpected rain arrives, the camper realizes the need for a solid, well-pegged pitch to prevent the tent from collapsing. Therefore, the combination of these events led the camper to secure the tent tightly.",

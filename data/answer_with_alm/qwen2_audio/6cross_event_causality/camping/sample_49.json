    "model_answer": "The factors most likely leading to the hiker's choice of this secluded camp location are A and C. The mention of searching for a place to set up camp and finding a spot with sweeping views suggests that the hiker was actively seeking a suitable location. Additionally, the fact that the hiker avoided the area in summer due to the presence of rattlesnakes and noted that they are currently underground indicates that he had knowledge of the area and chose a location accordingly. Option B only mentions the hiker heading off into the woods to set up camp, without any specific details about the location. Option D does not seem relevant to the selection of the camp location.",

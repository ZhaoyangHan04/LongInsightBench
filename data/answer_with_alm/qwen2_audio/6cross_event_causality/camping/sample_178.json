Option B does not mention the usage of heaters, and option D only mentions the location of the speaker and does not reference any previous events regarding heating arrangements.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible causes of her preference to cook outside the tent are events A (poor indoor ventilation due to cold, lack of windows, and need to keep things warm) and B (propane stove and kitchen appliances pose hazards when used indoors). Option C (functional outdoor kitchen area) seems less likely because it only mentions setting up a hand-washing station and does not specifically address cooking arrangements. Option D (campsite lighting) is also less likely because it only mentions the general setup of lights in the forest without any reference to cooking preferences.",

    "model_answer": "The hosts included the ceramic heater link because they experienced problems with keeping warm while camping, particularly after using a noisy generator as recommended in Event 8. They learned about the ceramic heater from a viewer who left a comment, which led them to mention its cost and durability in their later video. This event seems to have prompted them to share information about a product that could improve the comfort of their own and potentially their viewersâ€™ camping experiences. Therefore, the answer is A: Event 8.",

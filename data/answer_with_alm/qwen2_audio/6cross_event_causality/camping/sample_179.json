    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Events 2, 3, and 4: preparing and modifying the hardware (nuts/bolts/unistrut) and drilling (E2), sliding small bolts into the back-plate tracks and setting angle brackets (E3), then measuring, aligning, and fastening brackets to the Rhino Backbone rack so the plate bolts line up (E4).\n\nThese events directly enable the mounting of the shower room by ensuring that the necessary hardware is prepared, installed, and aligned properly. Drilling (E2) creates holes in the Rhino Backbone rack for the screws used to attach the brackets, while the subsequent events involve sliding bolts into tracks and setting angle brackets, followed by measuring, aligning, and fastening the brackets using nuts and bolts. This process ensures that the shower room is securely attached to the rack and can be mounted on the side of the Jeep as described in the video.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Events 1, 7, and 8: realizing its privacy value from a solo trip (E1), then seeing how easily it deploys (unzips, swings out bars) in operation (E7) and how simply it folds and zips back up to be ready to go (E8). These events helped the presenter understand the practicality and usefulness of the car-side shower room, leading to the decision to add it to their Jeep.",

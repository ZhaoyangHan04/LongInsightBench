    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: screwing the white gas adapter onto the canister and pressing down for about 30 seconds to transfer fuel, accompanied by an audible hiss. This action allowed the gas to flow from the canister into the stove's fuel compartment, which was necessary for the stove to ignite. The other events listed may have contributed indirectly to the success of the ignition, but they were not the direct actions that caused the flame to appear.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 3 â€” Chilled the receiving canister for at least 10 minutes and fitted the brass adapter into the nozzle to prepare for efficient liquid transfer. This step was necessary to ensure that the canister could accept liquid fuel efficiently, which would lead to the current fill level of 3.63 lb. \n\nOption B (Pressing the adapter nipple down) occurred during the process of filling the canister, but it did not directly lead to the current fill level. Option C (Ensuring the nipple was seated correctly) also occurred during the filling process, but it did not directly affect the fill level either. Option D (Identifying the donor butane brand and discussing prices) does not seem to be related to the process of refilling the gas canister.",

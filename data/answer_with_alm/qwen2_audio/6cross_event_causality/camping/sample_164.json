    "model_answer": "The events that most directly caused the speaker's decision to go camping are B: Event 4 and D: Event 5. The mention of finding no road to the destination and the directive from the Lord to travel the road to its end suggest a sense of destiny or calling towards the forest area. Additionally, the decision to set up a base camp and inspect forest property for possible purchase in Event 7 may have been influenced by the previous events, but it is not the direct cause of the camping decision. As for Event 2, while it does relate to the speaker's interest in exploring new places, it does not play a significant role in the decision to go camping.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 8: Interior camper visuals show the battery/inverter setup while the speaker explains a 35-watt charger for a 100-amp battery and says “More power,” indicating limited electrical capacity. This suggests that the speaker has limited access to electricity, which will make the trip low-tech.",

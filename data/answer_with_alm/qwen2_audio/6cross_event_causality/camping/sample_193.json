    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: He first selected and cloth-filtered moving creek water, then fired a paint-can hobo cooker with self-lighting charcoal until the coals turned white and put the water on to boil, after which he mixed coffee with an egg and crushed shell, brought it to a rolling boil and let it settle (events 1, 2, 4, 5).\n\nThis sequence directly enabled the man to make coffee using natural resources available in the wilderness. By selecting clean moving creek water, he ensured a good starting point for his coffee-making process. Using a hobo stove to heat the water and cook the eggs provided a convenient and efficient way to heat the mixture. Finally, letting the coffee settle allowed him to control the strength and texture of the final product.\n\nOption B does not mention any action related to making coffee, option C describes a different cooking activity, and option D involves leaving the area, none of which are directly relevant to making coffee.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: He established a hot hobo stove/oven with charcoal and sticks (events 1â€“2) and then hollowed an orange, filled it with batter, and placed it on the hobo oven (event 6), leading to a cooked muffin whose rind prevents burning (event 8). This sequence directly led to the man being able to check that the muffin was just about done and taking a bite without the muffin burning. The other events listed may have indirectly contributed to the final outcome, but they were not the direct cause of the muffin being cooked and ready to eat.",

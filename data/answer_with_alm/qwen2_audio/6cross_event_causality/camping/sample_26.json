    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Being at Phoenix Raceway Gate 3 at night while discussing the event (event 4).\n\nExplanation: The video shows a nighttime race where a crash occurs, and the on-screen text reads “And the Winner is Daniel Hemric.” This implies that the person who won the race was at the Phoenix Raceway during the time of the race. The only option that mentions being at Phoenix Raceway is option C, which states that the speaker was at Phoenix Raceway Gate 3 at night while discussing the event. This indicates that the speaker was likely present at the race when it occurred, which allowed them to capture the championship finish on camera. Options A, B, and D do not mention Phoenix Raceway or indicate that the speaker was present during the race.",

    "model_answer": "The most likely answer is B: Driving toward the parking area on the highway (event 1), clearing the ticket checkpoint and entering the grounds (event 2), and settling into the RV community shown earlier (event 3). This sequence sets the stage for a nighttime gathering at the campsite, as well as the subsequent appearance of the host at the gate. The other events either occur after the initial arrival at the venue or do not involve the specific actions leading up to the nighttime gathering at the gate.",

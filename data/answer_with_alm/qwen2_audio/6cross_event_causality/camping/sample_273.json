    "model_answer": "The most direct cause of the tender result is likely option B: seasoning the ribs, adding onions and garlic, placing them into a foil-lined Dutch oven, and planning to cook them on the fire for a couple of hours. This preparation helps to ensure that the ribs are flavorful and cooked through properly. The other events may have contributed indirectly to the final result, but they are not as directly linked to achieving tender, falling-out bones.",

    "model_answer": "The preceding sub-events that most directly led to the outcome of relaxing by the fire at night, feeling stuffed, and enjoying more rum were:\n\nA) Event 9: Pulling the ribs off the fire, unwrapping them, and confirming they’re done and ready to serve.\nB) Event 10: Eating ribs and rice at night (headlamp on), saying the food is “pretty damn good,” noting they can’t finish all the portions, and giving the dog her cut.\nC) Event 11: Picking bones for the dog and explicitly deciding to build the fire back up so they can hang out.\n\nThese events established the foundation for a relaxing evening around the campfire. Event 9 provided sustenance and the satisfaction of a successful meal, while Event 10 indicated that they had enjoyed their food and were in a casual, comfortable state. Event 11 added a sense of communal activity and preparation for the evening ahead, which contributed to the overall relaxed atmosphere.",

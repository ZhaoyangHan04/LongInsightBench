    "model_answer": "The most plausible option is C: Event 4: Upon arriving at the flat clearing, he notes thereâ€™s a water source nearby for his dogs while surveying the site. This event indicates that the speaker had already located the water source before his dogs reached it, which is necessary for them to be able to get it. The other events do not provide sufficient context or timing to support the dogs reaching the water source.",

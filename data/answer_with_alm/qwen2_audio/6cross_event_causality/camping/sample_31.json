    "model_answer": "The most direct actions that led to the official bestowal were likely C: The boy reciting a pledge about taking care of plants and animals and treating everyone with respect, and D: At the campsite, a male voice notes that Liam has finished his Junior Ranger program and that they'll be going to see the ceremony shortly. These events suggest that Liam had completed the necessary requirements for the Junior Ranger program, which included learning about environmental stewardship and demonstrating those values through actions and words. The other events, such as the children's research activity and the family's canoe outing, may have been related to the broader experience of spending time outdoors, but they do not seem to be specifically connected to the awarding of the Junior Ranger title.",

    "model_answer": "The direct actions that most enabled the sausages to be cooked on the grill at the campsite were C: earlier grilling and wood preparation, including cooking bacon on the grill and chopping wood. These actions likely provided the necessary heat source and materials for grilling the sausages. Option A mentions setting up by the lake with a picnic table and chairs, but it does not specifically mention grilling or preparing wood. Option B focuses on building and maintaining the campfire, which may have been used for other activities but not necessarily grilling sausages. Option D mentions spending time at the playground, but again, it does not specifically mention grilling or preparing wood.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: E2 deciding to test the thin climate-quilt quilts, E7 experiencing a colder-than-expected low (43°F) and feeling chilly, and E10 reflecting on the clear, windless night conditions.\nThe camper's conclusion about the climate-shield quilt not trusting it below the mid-50s was likely influenced by his personal experience of using it in cold weather. The reference to E2 testing the quilt, E7 feeling chilly despite the lower temperature, and E10 reflecting on the conditions suggest that these experiences were critical in forming the camper's opinion of the quilt's performance in cold temperatures.",

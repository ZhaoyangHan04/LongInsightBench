    "model_answer": "The most direct step that led to the tent being fully upright was likely option C: Building from the top down by sliding roof poles through crisscross tunnels and using the ring-and-pin method to stand the side poles. This is because building from the top down allows for a more stable and secure starting point, and the use of the ring-and-pin method helps to quickly establish the structure of the tent.",

    "model_answer": "The most direct action that led to the secured and aligned rainfly outcome was likely option B: walking the rainfly over the top and using Velcro on the underside to wrap around the frame so it won't blow away and stays aligned. This step is crucial for properly securing the rainfly to the tent structure and ensuring it remains taut and stable during wind conditions.",

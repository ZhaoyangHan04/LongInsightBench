    "model_answer": "The preceding events that most directly led to the boil-over outcome were:\n\nA: Keeping the lid on while bringing the water to a rolling boil in the cup (event 1)\nB: Using the Pathfinder nesting cup with lid/pouring holes that heats quickly and shows steam when boiling (event 3)\n\nExplanation:\nOption A is correct because keeping the lid on helps to contain the steam and pressure within the cup as the water continues to heat and boil. This reduces the risk of the steam escaping and causing a boil-over. Option B is also correct because using a nesting cup with a lid and pour-holes that show steam helps to indicate when the water has come to a boil, which allows the user to carefully control the heat and prevent a boil-over from occurring. Options C and D do not seem to be directly related to the boil-over outcome.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are B/C. The speaker mentions needing to use a folded-up shim to handle the pot because the nesting cup heats quickly and shows steam through the lid holes when boiling (event 3), and also noting that the wood is hot while feeding small twigs to keep the stove burning to boil water (event 5). These events demonstrate the importance of handling hot objects safely to avoid burns.",

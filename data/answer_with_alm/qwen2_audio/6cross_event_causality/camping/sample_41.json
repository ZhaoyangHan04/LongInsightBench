    "model_answer": "The most plausible contributing factors to the morning freeze being observed at Kevin's campsite are events C: The overnight temperature drop to -5C (event 6, on-screen text/visual) and D: Having his first coffee of the day (event 7, audio). These events suggest that the temperature dropped significantly overnight, allowing the lake to freeze over, and that Kevin was present at the campsite early enough to observe the frozen condition of the lake. Option A (choosing and announcing a lakeside spot for the night, with a nice view of the lake) does not directly relate to the morning freeze, while option B (setting up camp and spending the night at the site) only mentions activities that occurred after the lake had already frozen.",

    "model_answer": "The preceding sub-events that most directly led to seeing the flow and the water clearing out were B: Event 1: Before removing the cap, the speaker confirms the black/gray valve handles are shut and identifies/installs the sewer connection with a clear elbow so they can watch the flow, and C: Event 3: The speaker pulls the black-tank lever and turns on the water to fill/flush until it runs clear. These events allowed the speaker to monitor the flow of water and ensure it was going into the sewer connection correctly.",

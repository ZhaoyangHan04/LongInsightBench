    "model_answer": "Option B: Event 1: Describing it as a secret camping spot he’s never camped at before (it’s usually taken), while the visuals show a quiet, secluded forest drive and glimpses of the lake with no people.\nThis option best fits the context because it describes the initial discovery of the spot being unoccupied and secluded, which aligns with the narrator's perception of having the entire lake to himself later in the day. The other events do not convey the same level of exclusivity or peacefulness of the location.",

    "model_answer": "The most relevant earlier sub-event would be option D: Event 3: Saying he doesn’t like the look of the road and deciding to take one road and walk to the rest, indicating he’ll physically check multiple sites. This is because the narrator mentions identifying specific campsites and giving them numbers, which suggests that he has been exploring the area and choosing locations. Option A only references finding a fire ring and does not mention campsite numbering. Option B talks about a tour of a secret spot but does not mention site numbering. Option C mentions weighing whether to take a spot and worrying about it being claimed, but it does not mention site numbering either.",

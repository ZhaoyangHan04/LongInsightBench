    "model_answer": "The most direct step that enabled the result in event 9 was event 8, where the demonstrator laid out poles and canvas, inserted ridge and upright poles, added spreader poles, covered with canvas, secured with elastic hooks, and tied down the annex. This provided the basic structure necessary for the annex to be set up and ready for use. The other events were necessary but did not directly contribute to the final setup of the Stirling GT annex.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible option is C: Event 3 â€” Organize and identify poles by type (upright, ridge, spreader, window stays) for the trailer setup (audio) while the presenter demonstrates and points out pole features outdoors (visual). This step involves organizing and identifying the different types of poles used in setting up the trailer, which includes uprights, ridge poles, spreader bars, and window stays. These poles are essential components of the trailer setup and are likely used to create the basic form of the setup described in the audio. The subsequent events, such as mechanical prep around the trailer, pre-entry tent steps, post-setup tips, etc., may have contributed to the final setup, but they are not directly related to organizing and identifying the poles.",

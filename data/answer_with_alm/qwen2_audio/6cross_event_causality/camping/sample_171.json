    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Deploying an off-center-fed dipole about 65 feet up with a long coax run at high altitude (event 4).\n\nThis setup choice allowed for clear communication over longer distances due to the high altitude and the use of an off-center-fed dipole which provides better signal reception. The long coax run also helps to reduce signal loss. This setup was crucial for making a clean QSO from the off-grid campsite.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Setting up in an area with a clear, unobstructed sky—seen in the open-sky shots outside—which matches the stated requirement for a clear southern view (events 4 and referenced in 5).\n\nThis condition was necessary because the satellite XM receiver requires a clear southern view to receive signals. The open-sky shots in the video indicate that the campsite has a clear southern view, which allowed for successful satellite radio reception.",

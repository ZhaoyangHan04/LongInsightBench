    "model_answer": "The answer must have occurred before the point where the speaker mentioned having a regular pup tent style tent that they could get inside of. Of the above events, only event C directly relates to setting up a tent: creating an adjustable loop with a trucker's hitch for the next corner after making a loop jam. This step would be necessary to set up a tent properly. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Setting up the A-frame by running the line through the center tie-out with a toggle and tying a truckerâ€™s hitch on the other end.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are B/C. The prior actions of creating an adjustable loop by tying a trucker's hitch after making a loop jam to tension a corner and securing corners and adding tensioning loops as the tarp is pulled over and set directly allowed the flying tarp configuration to be achieved. These actions helped in adjusting the tarp's shape and ensuring it was secure before flying it off the ground.",

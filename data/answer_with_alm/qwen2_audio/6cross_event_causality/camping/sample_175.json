This implies that they did not catch any fish during their previous activity, which led them to have steaks and bacon instead. Option A is unlikely because the speaker has not yet started ice fishing. Option C does not make sense as it only mentions what the speaker had for breakfast and does not relate to the events leading up to having steaks and bacon. Option D is also unlikely because the speaker only mentions that the Russian Bear tent is back in stock and does not mention any fishing activity.",

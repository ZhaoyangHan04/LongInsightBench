    "model_answer": "The most direct leading events to the appearance of the Camping Checklist graphic were likely A: Event 2 and C: Event 4, as these events specifically mention packing and organizing camping supplies, which would be essential for creating a checklist. Option B (Event 3) involves packing individual items into a bin but does not necessarily focus on creating a comprehensive checklist, and Option D (Event 7) deals with emergency supplies and does not seem to be directly related to creating a checklist for camping.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible preceding events are B: Event 1: The female speaker reflects on realizing she left items at home and her thoughts outpacing her actions when packing, and C: Event 3: They load essentials into a bin with on-screen text Extra Lanterns & Flashlights, and the audio lists what to include. These events suggest that the conversation about packing for camping led to a discussion about emergency preparedness, which eventually led to demonstrating the contents of the emergency kit.",

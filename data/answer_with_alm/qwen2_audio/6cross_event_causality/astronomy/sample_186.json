    "model_answer": "The events leading to the conclusion that we can see 59% of the Moon's surface from Earth are A and C. \n\nOption A is correct because it explains how the changing viewing angle due to Earth's rotation and observer latitude allows us to see more of the Moon's surface than if we could only observe from a single point. This effect, known as diurnal libration, contributes to us being able to see about 59% of the Moon's surface at any given time.\n\nOption C is also correct because it explains how the Moon's rotation on its axis causes it to always show the same face to us (the near side), which means that we cannot see the other side without the help of spacecraft. This is why the first images of the Moon's far side were taken by spacecraft like Luna 3.",

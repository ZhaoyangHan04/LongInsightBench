    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Event 6 â€” After PEC training, he improves guiding to about 0.6 while carefully adjusting the rig outside. \n\nThis event directly enabled the later result because it improved his ability to guide the camera accurately, which is necessary for obtaining clear images of the comet. The other events may have indirectly contributed to the final outcome, but they were not the direct cause.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are A, B, C, D. \n\nOption A is correct because the speaker mentions using his new CEM 26 mount and camera setup to capture images of the green comet. This implies that he had planned and prepared for this event by selecting the appropriate equipment.\n\nOption B is also correct because the speaker mentions inputting the comet's coordinates into NINA to frame the target. This indicates that he had researched and prepared for the location and orientation of the comet.\n\nOption C is correct because the speaker confirms that the comet is tracking nicely and that he is capturing 90-second subs he will stack. This implies that he has been observing the comet and taking images over time.\n\nOption D is correct because the speaker mentions finding polar alignment awkward and noting that the mount shifts when tightening locks. This suggests that he had to adjust his equipment and technique to properly align and capture images of the comet.",

    "model_answer": "The answer must include the steps taken before imaging Saturn. The direct lead-up to fully collimating the telescope was achieved by using a Bahtinov mask to center the focus pattern (option A), followed by demonstrating and employing the three front collimation screws with Bob’s Knobs on the OTA (option B). Additionally, defocusing on a bright star (option C) helped identify the collimation issue, which was then corrected by turning the corresponding Bob’s Knob (option D). Therefore, the correct answer is (A/B/C/D).",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Announcing that it’s the night of Saturn’s opposition and planning to collimate (event 1). \n\nThe audio indicates that the speaker is preparing for imaging Saturn on a clear opposition night. They mention putting their Celestron OTA back on and planning to perform a collimation exercise. This preparation is necessary for obtaining clear images of Saturn's rings. The other events mentioned may be related to the imaging process but are not directly instrumental in enabling the final result of seeing bright rings.",

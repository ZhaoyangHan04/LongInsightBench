    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 2: The solar system diagram lists the planets while Pluto’s orbit is marked with a red X; the audio notes Pluto’s reclassification.\n\nThis event led to a revision in the scientific understanding of what constitutes a planet. Prior to the discovery of Pluto in the late 19th century, the term 'planet' was broadly defined to include any celestial body that orbited the sun and was large enough to be rounded by its own gravity. However, with the discovery of Pluto and other objects like Ceres and Eris in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune's orbit, it became clear that the traditional definition did not account for all the objects in the solar system. As a result, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined the term 'planet' to exclude Pluto and other objects in the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud, and instead defined a planet as a celestial body that orbits the sun, is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, and has cleared its orbit of other debris. This change directly led to the inclusion of Pluto in the new definition of a planet, which emphasizes the dominant feature of a planet's orbit over its size or composition.",

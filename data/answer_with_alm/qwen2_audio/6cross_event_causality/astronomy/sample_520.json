    "model_answer": "Based on the provided information, it is most plausible that the conclusion about the presence of many more interstellar objects was reached through events 10 and 14-15, specifically due to the discussion of 'Oumuamua and comet 2I/Borisov passing through on interstellar trajectories, which led to the prediction of many more such objects by Penarrubia. This information was presented in conjunction with the visual aid of a solar system diagram, further supporting the idea that the narrator is discussing the topic of interstellar objects in relation to our solar system. Therefore, the answer is C: Event 10.",

    "model_answer": "The events that most directly motivate and lead to the strategy of identifying distinct populations using the orbits of many objects are events 5-7, where the capture-and-release gravitational slingshot explanation is presented, which implies a mix of interstellar debris near the Solar System that needs to be distinguished from native bodies. This event lays the foundation for understanding the composition and origin of objects in our Solar System and how they might differ from those found elsewhere.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Preprocessing the best Jupiter/Saturn movie in PIPP by dragging it in and clicking “optimize options for planetary” so the planet is auto-centered (event 6).\n\nThis step was crucial as it allowed the speaker to obtain a high-quality movie of Jupiter and Saturn, which were then processed further using other software tools like AutoStakkert and RegiStax. Without this initial preprocessing step, the subsequent steps would not have been possible or effective.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Using the Canon DSLR’s special crop mode to capture a short, sharp planetary clip after framing in normal video mode (event 3). This action allowed the user to select and focus on the planets, which was necessary for PIPP processing to begin. Option B mentions recording on a shaky deck, but it does not specify how that relates to starting PIPP processing. Option C involves transferring a movie to a computer, which comes later in the process. Option D discusses camera preferences, but does not mention any specific actions related to starting PIPP processing.",

    "model_answer": "The combination of factors is likely the main cause, but without knowing the exact timing and sequence of events, it's challenging to pinpoint the direct cause. However, based on the given information, we can infer that:\n\nA: The lower image quality from earlier sequences due to low ISO, small aperture, and short shutter speed may have contributed to the difficulty in discerning the moon's surface detail during the umbra.\n\nB: The use of a smaller sensor and limited control over aperture by the Raspberry Pi camera would have reduced the camera's ability to capture details under low light conditions.\n\nC: The improvised adapter and flange setup may have introduced additional optical errors or distortions, reducing the camera's overall performance.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is D: A plane crossing the moon forced the telescope to be rotated, which may have temporarily blocked the view of the moon's surface.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Connecting the camera module to a zoom lens (event 0) and mounting itâ€”shown visually as a lens with a circuit board attached and described in the narration. This step changed the focal length of the setup from the native focal length of the Raspberry Pi camera to a longer focal length, allowing it to capture images with a larger field of view. The use of the smaller sensor (option B) and setting the correct flange focal distance with a 20 mm spacer (option C) were also important, but they did not directly affect the maximum focal length of the setup. The mechanical clearance of a cheap tripod (option D) was necessary for stability during image capture but did not contribute to the maximum focal length.",

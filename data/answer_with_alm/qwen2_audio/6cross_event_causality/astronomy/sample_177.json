    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Event 4 — Introduction to nakshatras as divisions of the lunar orbit and methods to identify junction stars by brightness and position, establishing how stellar reference points are defined.\n\nThis event provides the foundational knowledge necessary to understand the concepts used in calculating the latitude data for Surya Siddhanta. By discussing nakshatras as divisions of the lunar orbit and the identification of junction stars, it sets the stage for understanding how celestial references were used in ancient astronomical calculations. This knowledge is crucial for interpreting the data displayed in events 14 and 15, which involve analyzing celestial positions and their movements over time.",

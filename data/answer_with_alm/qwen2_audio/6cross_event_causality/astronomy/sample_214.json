    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Configuring the C11 image train at 2800 mm with an off-axis guider and explicitly choosing no filter to capture the galaxy in full broadband (event 4). This step was crucial for capturing the galaxy in its full detail and quality. The other steps, such as calibrating with flats and darks, sorting frames, and the intro segment, were important but did not directly lead to the sharp final result.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Setting up the C11 at 2800 mm, explaining the off-axis guider/camera chip arrangement, and choosing no filter (full broadband) during capture (event 4). This setup allowed for the capture of high-quality images with detailed features like the dust lanes in Centaurus A, which were not visible in other galaxies due to their high detail and quality. The other events mentioned may have contributed to the overall success of the image capture, but they were not the direct cause of the detailed image of Centaurus A.",

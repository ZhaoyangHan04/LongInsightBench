    "model_answer": "I would select events A, B, and C as they directly explain why visibility of C/2023 P1 may end around September 12th. \n\nEvent A explains the comet's closest approach to Earth on September 12th, which makes it more visible. Perihelion, occurring five days later, also increases the likelihood of the comet being visible. Additionally, the description of the comet's motion towards the Sun (\"the Sun's direction\") suggests that it will move into alignment with the Sun, making it less visible as it rises higher in the sky.\n\nEvent B describes the comet's predicted path across the sky, highlighting its potential location relative to the Sun and the observer's location. As the comet moves closer to the Sun and becomes lower in the sky, it will become increasingly difficult to view.\n\nEvent C provides practical advice for viewing the comet, such as setting early alarms, using binoculars or telescopes, and finding dark skies. This information is relevant to understanding the conditions under which the comet will be visible.\n\nEvent D, while interesting, does not directly relate to the visibility of C/2023 P1 around September 12th.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A, Event 11 (earlier in the same segment) â€“ It passes very close to the Sun in early Oct 2024 and briefly vanishes, setting up a post-encounter reappearance and nightly brightening once it moves away from the Sun's glare.\nExplanation: The passage states that comet C/2023 A3 will reappear in the northern hemisphere after Oct 11-12, 2024, brightening each night. This is directly related to event 11, which mentions that the comet will pass very close to the Sun in early October 2024 and briefly disappear before reappearing. This sets up the conditions for the comet to be visible again and brighten at night. Options B, C, and D do not directly relate to the comet's reappearance and brightening.",

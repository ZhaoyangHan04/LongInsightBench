    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Event 4: The narrator details the evolution of telescope optics and materials since Galileo, noting ESO mirrors made from Zero-dur; another speaker describes ESO challenging industry with bigger pieces. The history timeline and telescope interiors visually demonstrate the engineering path to larger apertures.\n\nThis event provides the context for understanding the technological advancements that led to the development of the ELT's capabilities. The discussion on telescope optics and materials starting from Galileo highlights the importance of research and development in advancing astronomical instrumentation. The reference to ESO's challenges in building bigger telescopes showcases the efforts towards achieving larger apertures, which is crucial for collecting more light and enabling new types of observations. This event sets the stage for the technological advancements that enabled the ELT to collect 15 times more light than the largest optical telescope today.",

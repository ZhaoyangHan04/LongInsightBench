    "model_answer": "The answer is likely to include both events 14 and 15 as they build the conceptual foundation for understanding white dwarfs as dead stars. Event 14 provides context on main-sequence stars and lifetimes, which is relevant to discussing white dwarfs. Event 15 introduces the H-R diagram and its relationship to temperatures and luminosities, which is crucial for classifying stars like Sirius A and its companion. Therefore, the correct answer would be A and C.",

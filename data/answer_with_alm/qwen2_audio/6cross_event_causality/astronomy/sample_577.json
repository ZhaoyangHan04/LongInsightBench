    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are A, B, C, D.\nEvent 7 provides a detailed explanation of how Makar Sankranti is celebrated, but it does not mention any specific sub-events leading up to the conclusion about the date of the festival. Therefore, we cannot select option A.\nOption B provides important context about the time of the Sun's entry into Capricornus, which is relevant to understanding the significance of Makar Sankranti. Option C also helps us understand the cultural practices associated with the festival, which further supports the connection between the Sun's position in the sky and the celebration of Makar Sankranti.\nOption D provides background information about the Earth's orbit and axial tilt, which are essential for understanding the astronomical reasons behind the timing of Makar Sankranti. This information helps us appreciate the scientific basis for the festival's celebration.\nTherefore, the correct answer(s) are A, B, C, D.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is (A) and (B). In event 4, the speaker explains that in ancient times, when the Sun entered Capricorn, it was aligned with the winter solstice, and Makar Sankranti marked the beginning of winter. This indicates that the ancient connection between Makar Sankranti and the winter solstice is the primary evidence used to support the argument about the forward shift of the festival's date. Event 6 provides additional evidence by showing specific tables with the exact times when the Sun entered Capricorn during the years 2001-2008, which supports the idea that the festival has shifted to occur after sunset on January 14th.",

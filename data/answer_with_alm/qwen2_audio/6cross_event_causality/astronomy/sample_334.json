    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are A, B, and C. The COBE space measurements and CMB maps showing an overall smooth universe with small temperature inconsistencies (event 9) helped establish the large-scale structure of the universe and the existence of dark matter. The discussion of alternative expansion models (coasting vs accelerating) and mention of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, connecting to an accelerating universe (event 6), provided further evidence for an expanding universe that is accelerating. The presentation of a beautiful image of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae and the E-ELT construction images (event 4) was unrelated to the composition of the universe.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are B/C.\nEvent 8 describes Penzias and Wilson's discovery of the cosmic background radiation and COBE's precise blackbody fit at 2.73 K, which led to the development of the inflationary model. Event 9 explains how COBE and subsequent satellites observed the CMB's overall smoothness with small temperature inconsistencies, providing further evidence for the inflationary model.\nOption A does not seem to be directly related to the comparison of the Inflationary model with the Standard model in Figure 29.25. Option D mentions using a balloon analogy for redshift but does not provide context for the comparison between the two models.",

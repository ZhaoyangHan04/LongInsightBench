    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are A, B, C, D.\nEvent 7 provided background on infrared astronomy, which helped map the galaxy's scale and dust content. Event 5 discussed the challenges in observing the Milky Way from within and the importance of comparing observations over time. Event 6 explained how the galaxy's structure, including its stars, spiral arms, and dark matter, was estimated based on these observations. Finally, Event 3 highlighted the Milky Way's size and its role as a recipient of dwarf galaxies, providing additional context for understanding the galaxy's overall composition and characteristics. These events collectively enabled the precise placement of the solar system relative to the Milky Way mentioned in the audio clip.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: B/C\nEvent 7 explained how infrared astronomy helped map the structure of our galaxy, which provided crucial data for understanding the Sun's orbit. Event 9 gave us a clear measurement of the distance between the Sun and the Galactic Center, which is necessary for calculating the Sun's orbit. Option A does not mention the Sun's orbit, and while it discusses the presence of dark matter, it is not directly related to the measurements needed to determine the Sun's orbit. Option D provides information about the Milky Way's size and history, but it does not specifically mention the Sun's orbit or the measurements used to calculate it.",

    "model_answer": "The segment that most directly sets up the end-of-episode call-to-action is Event 10: The “cosmic calendar” slide that audibly compresses the universe’s history into a single year, culminating with humans appearing in the final hours, signaling a thematic wrap-up. This slide provides a concise summary of the episode's content and sets the stage for the call-to-action by highlighting the importance of the channel's work and encouraging viewers to engage further.",

    "model_answer": "The prior point most plausibly laid the groundwork for this instrument-and-wavelength-focused segment is B: Event 6: The spiral galaxy (NGC 1073) slide with narration about blue/white star-forming regions and dark dust lanes—i.e., gas and dust as the ingredients for new stars. This slide likely introduced the concept of using telescopes to observe different types of celestial objects and their properties, which is relevant to the discussion of the ALMA radio telescope array and its ability to observe nearby galaxies in millimeter/21-cm radiation.",

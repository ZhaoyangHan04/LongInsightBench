    "model_answer": "The most plausible answer is B: Event 3: The narrator speaks of “cataclysmic events” and the “scars etched upon its surface” as visuals show stark, eroded rocky landscapes, suggesting abundant loose material and a harsh climate. This suggests that the planet's surface has been shaped by significant geological events, which could lead to the formation of dust storms. Additionally, the mention of \"intense dust storms\" in Event 5 also contributes to this answer as it indicates that the planet is capable of experiencing intense weather events.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible earlier sub-event would be option D: Event 1: A poetic narration on the cosmos and the birth of Mars with Earth-Mars-Sun vistas, emphasizing origins rather than practical conditions for present-day habitats or plant research. This event sets the stage for exploring the idea of life beyond Earth and lays the groundwork for scientific inquiries into habitability on other celestial bodies like Mars. The subsequent events could build upon this foundation by presenting visualizations of potential Martian landscapes, discussions of atmospheric conditions, and studies of microorganisms that might thrive in such environments.",

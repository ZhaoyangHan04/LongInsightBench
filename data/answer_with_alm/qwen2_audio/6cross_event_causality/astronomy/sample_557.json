    "model_answer": "Answer: C: Event 12 – Statement that intense radiation from bright stars blows away gas and limits star formation, observable with telescopes.\nThe discussion in event 12 about intense radiation from massive stars blowing away gas and limiting star formation is what directly motivated adding the disruptive processes of jets and radiation to the simulation in event 13. This idea is supported by observations of massive stars interacting with their surroundings and driving out gas, which can limit star formation in the region.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Event 9 – Explanation that a cloud shrank to a spinning disc with the sun in the middle and planets in the outer parts, with additional outflows complicating the scene.\n\nThis event describes the process by which giant molecular clouds collapse under gravity, leading to the formation of stars. As the cloud collapses, it forms a spinning disk, with the central part of the cloud becoming the sun and material from the surrounding cloud forming planets, comets, and asteroids. This process is supported by various other events throughout the presentation, such as the discussion of gravitational pull-in and the formation of clumps, as well as the observation of massive stars and their impact on the surrounding environment.",

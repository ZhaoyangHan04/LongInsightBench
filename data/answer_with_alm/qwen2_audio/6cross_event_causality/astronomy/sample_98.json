    "model_answer": "The preceding events that most directly enabled the reversal were:\n\nA: Event 8 – Setting up a no-budget diffraction-spike experiment: cutting and preparing wooden sticks as a DIY add-on (audio: determined to prove a point about spikes).\nB: Event 9 – Building and testing the homemade “JWST”: taping the sticks onto the CELESTRON telescope and trying it on clusters, discovering interference from the moon and kitchen light (audio: test issues/results).\n\nThese two events allowed the narrator to experiment with different methods of creating diffraction spikes and observe their effects under various conditions. This experimentation led him to conclude that the spikes were caused by the gaps in the JWST's mirror and other telescopes' struts, and that stars are actually round, unlike the spikes. This realization ultimately led to the positive reception of his image.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 4 – Explanation that JWST’s mirror gaps and other telescopes’ struts cause diffraction spikes; stars are round and the spikes are artifacts (visual diagrams and labels).\n\nThis event explains how the design of the Giant Magellan Telescope, including its mirror gaps and struts, can lead to diffraction spikes. This knowledge is relevant to the current discussion on reducing diffraction spikes in the telescope's design.",

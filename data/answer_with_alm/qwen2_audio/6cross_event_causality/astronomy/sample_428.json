    "model_answer": "I would select option C, Event 9 - The narrator discusses the standard model and references the El Gordo galaxy cluster while detailing JWST findings about young galaxies' dynamics, linking them to model tensions.\n\nThis passage directly sets up the classification of the ultra-early collision between massive galaxy clusters as a major challenge because it mentions that the narrator is discussing the standard model and referencing specific observational findings from the JWST, which include the detection of a massive early collision. This indicates that the narrator is comparing these observed events to theoretical models and highlighting discrepancies or challenges that arise from this comparison.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 10. In event 10, the narrator mentions that the James Webb Space Telescope has found that ancient galaxies produced far fewer heavy elements than predicted, which contradicts current models. This discrepancy is highlighted as a significant challenge for astronomers trying to understand the formation of the universe.",

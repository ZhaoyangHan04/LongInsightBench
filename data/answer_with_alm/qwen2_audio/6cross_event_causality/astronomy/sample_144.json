    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 5: Explaining the difference between the visible photosphere and the EUV corona, with visuals switching between the yellow sun and the coronal view.\n\nEvent 5 provides the foundation for understanding the differences between the visible photosphere and the EUV corona, which are crucial for distinguishing coronal holes from sunspots. The narrator likely explains how the EUV corona appears differently than the photosphere, leading to a better appreciation of the characteristics that define coronal holes, such as their dark appearance in the corona compared to the photosphere. This knowledge is essential for recognizing and analyzing sunspots, which also appear dark in the corona but have distinct magnetic structures that differentiate them from coronal holes.",

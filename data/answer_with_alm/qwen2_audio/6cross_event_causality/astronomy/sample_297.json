The remote opening of the roof was made possible by using an external motor (option B) which allowed for the installation of the roof in an outdoor location (event 2-3 explanation and outdoor visuals). Additionally, the use of the handheld button (option C) to trigger the roller door to open and close also played a crucial role in the functionality of the remote opening system.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are A, B, C, D. These choices allowed the presenter to safely park and shut the roof of the telescope during heavy rain. The angled aluminum strip (option A) helped prevent the roof from overflowing when it was raining heavily. The manual key release (option B) allowed the presenter to disengage the motor, making it easier to push the roof manually. The outdoor installation (option C) was necessary because indoor mounting was not feasible, which enabled the presenter to operate the telescope in bad weather conditions. Finally, the use of an iPhone camera and TeamViewer (option D) allowed the presenter to visually verify that the scope was properly parked before closing the roof.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 12 â€” The narrator explains a carbon detonation supernova in a white dwarf that gains mass (visuals: text \"Carbon Detonation Supernova\" and the dwarf pointing at \"Mass\").\n\nThis event directly sets up why the outcome would be classified as Type I because it involves a white dwarf gaining mass through a carbon detonation, which is a specific type of supernova explosion that occurs in low-mass stars like those found in white dwarfs. This explosion releases a large amount of energy and mass into space, which is characteristic of a Type I supernova.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are A, B, C, D. All four events contribute to the concept of \"stellar recycling\" in some way. Event 14 explains that nebulae are formed from the remnants of exploded stars, which are the same remnants that form new stars through the process of nuclear fusion described in event 16. Event 15 describes the process of nucleosynthesis, which creates heavy elements within stars, including the elements used to build planets like Earth. Event 9 provides a visual representation of the immense size of a supernova explosion, which can also have a significant impact on the formation of new stars and the distribution of heavy elements in the universe.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is: A/B/C/D\nEvent 6 explains how the solar system was unstable and had planet migration, which led to the formation of the solar system as we know it today. This lays the groundwork for understanding the architecture of other planetary systems.\nEvent 7 describes how Jupiter's movement affected the solar system, which also helps us understand other planetary systems.\nEvent 0 asks if the solar system has a history and if it is unchanging, which implies that we should study its history to understand it better.\nEvent 8 explains how Neptune's migration affected the outer solar system, which also helps us understand other planetary systems.\nTherefore, all four events directly or indirectly caused or laid the groundwork for the conclusion about understanding the architecture of other planetary systems.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is D: Event 4: The presentation on the formation of the solar system, which includes visual aids such as a protoplanetary disk and formation diagram, likely led to the presenter's discussion of the history of the solar system. This event emphasizes the short formation timescale around young stars, which contrasts with the notion of an unchanging solar system and supports the idea that history is important for understanding the solar system's development.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is (B). The observation of a narrow millisecond spike arriving earlier at higher frequencies and later at lower frequencies, contrasted against terrestrial interference that would be simultaneous across frequencies, was crucial in helping the presenter identify the bursts as coming from an extragalactic source. This allowed them to make the connection to dispersion and the bursts being part of a larger phenomenon, rather than just random interference.",

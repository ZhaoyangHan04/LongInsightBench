This sets the stage for understanding the relative positions of Io, Europa, and the Sun as seen from Earth.\n\nC: Event 4: While the orbital visualization is shown, the narrator explicitly says “the transit of Io begins,” and describes Io’s shadow moving into quadrant three along with other moons’ positions. This provides the specific timing and location of the transit event.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) and (C).",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 3 â€” Visual text and narration stating the Earth-Moon system orbits the Sun at about 66,620 MPH. This event provides the necessary background information about the velocity of the Earth-Moon system in relation to the Sun. Subsequently, the narrator uses this information to draw conclusions about the relative speeds of Apollo astronauts compared to the Sun and the Earth-Moon system.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are B and C. The Moon's orbit around the Earth can be explained by the gravitational force between the two bodies, which is a result of the mass of both the Earth and the Moon. Event 2 describes the Moon being in a stable orbit due to gravity, while Event 9 provides specific numbers regarding the relative sizes and masses of the Earth and Moon, which help to reinforce the concept of gravitational forces and orbits.",

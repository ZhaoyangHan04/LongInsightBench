    "model_answer": "The events that most directly caused the speaker's concluding excitement and expectation of better understanding were likely B: Event 3 – Contrast between a past large radio telescope and the upcoming Square Kilometer Array, with the speaker saying we will be able to see much, much more. This implies that the speaker is excited about the capabilities of the Square Kilometer Array to observe pulsars and other celestial objects that are currently beyond our reach. Additionally, the mention of the Square Kilometer Array's ability to detect smaller signals and its greater sensitivity may also contribute to the speaker's excitement.",

This segment highlighted the lack of diversity in the field of physics, which is a critical issue that contributes to the speaker's belief that not involving parents in encouraging teenagers towards physics/astronomy was a bad mistake.",

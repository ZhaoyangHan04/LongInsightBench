    "model_answer": "The answer is B: Event 7 — Against visuals of volcanic outcrops and annotated cliff sections, the narrator explains that a single flood doesn’t produce separate layers and contrasts graded bedding with real rock sequences, motivating a different, more realistic layering method.\n\nThis sub-event directly caused the layered outcome by challenging the commonly held belief that a global flood could produce distinct rock-like layers. The narrator's explanation using geological evidence from volcanic outcrops and cliff sections demonstrated that graded bedding is more characteristic of real rock sequences, not just a result of a single flood event. This led to a change in the layering method used in the Hovind Theory jar experiment, resulting in distinct layers of different materials.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Event 7 — The discussion at volcanic and cliff exposures that a single flood does not produce separate layers, contrasting graded bedding with real successions (including mention of limestone topped by chalk), setting up the idea that different materials form at different rates. This event emphasizes the observation that different geological processes occur at different speeds, which supports the idea that chalk was formed through slow accumulation over time, not during a single global flood.",

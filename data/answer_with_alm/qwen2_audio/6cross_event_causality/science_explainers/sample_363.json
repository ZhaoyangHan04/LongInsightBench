These examples help establish the concept of a hyper-torus, which is a flat universe with finite volume and no edge. Additionally, the speaker asks about gluing a hexagon, which suggests the possibility of creating a toroidal surface with a specific pattern. This setup and discussion laid the foundation for the subsequent conclusion and visual representation of the hyper-torus in Event 11.",

    "model_answer": "The discussion in Event 10 introduced non-orientable constructs such as the Möbius strip and Klein bottle, which led to the concept of non-orientable universes. The method of edge-gluing was also discussed, which is related to the creation of non-orientable spaces. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Event 10.",

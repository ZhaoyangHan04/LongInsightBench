    "model_answer": "The preceding events/sub-events that most plausibly served as the direct cause or primary contributing factors leading to the quieter, more efficient train performance were:\n\nC: Event 6 (within-event sub-event): The narrator explains engineers modeled the train’s nose on a kingfisher’s beak to reduce tunnel air-compression noise, which also saved power and added speed, as visuals cut between the kingfisher and the high-speed train.\n\nThis event directly addresses the improvement in the train's performance, specifically the reduction of noise and increase in speed and power savings. The use of a kingfisher's beak as inspiration for the train's nose is a clear example of biomimicry, which has been applied to various fields, including engineering. This application likely led to the development of a more efficient design for the train's nose.",

    "model_answer": "I selected option C: Event 7 because it is the most recent event and directly relates to the topic of cooling strategies in architecture. The other events may have inspired or influenced the concept of biomimicry, but they do not seem to be as directly connected to the specific development of termite-inspired ventilation in buildings.",

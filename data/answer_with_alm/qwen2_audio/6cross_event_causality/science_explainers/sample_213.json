    "model_answer": "The answer is B: Event 7: With psi fixed at 165Â°, the rotating phi scan shows yellow/red clash markers and a \"Clash!\" inset, while the narrator explains that many phi angles would be impossible because atoms get too close. This event directly led to the presenter concluding that it is physically impossible to achieve certain phi angles due to steric clashes between atoms.",

    "model_answer": "Option B: Event 8: The Ramachandran plot is introduced; the narrator highlights clusters corresponding to alpha helices and beta strands, and the visuals show where these regions lie on the phi/psi axes.\nThis event provides the foundational knowledge of the Ramachandran plot and its use in identifying protein secondary structure elements like alpha helices and beta strands. This understanding is crucial for determining the allowed psi regions based on the no-clash criteria described in events 6 and 9.",

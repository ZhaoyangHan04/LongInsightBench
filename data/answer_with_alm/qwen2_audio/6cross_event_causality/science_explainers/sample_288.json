    "model_answer": "The events that most directly enabled the determination of the ground elevation were likely A: Event 7, where the formula for calculating distance was derived using the pulse travel time and the speed of light, and B: Event 11, where the process of emitting a pulse, measuring its return time, and converting it into distance was explained. These events provided the mathematical framework for determining distance, which is necessary for calculating ground elevation. C: Event 4 introduced the use of GPS and IMU for altitude and orientation measurements, and D: Event 1 listed the different methods of collecting lidar data, but these events did not specifically relate to the calculation of ground elevation.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: The “Types of Light” segment explaining lidar uses green or near-infrared light because those wavelengths reflect strongly off vegetation.\n\nThis event explains the reason why multiple returns are obtained and interpreted in lidar systems. Lidar sends out laser pulses, and when these pulses hit objects like trees or buildings, they bounce back as echoes. The returning signals are detected by the lidar system and used to create detailed maps of the environment. In this case, using green or near-infrared light allows the system to better distinguish between different types of surfaces and objects, such as trees and buildings, which helps to improve the accuracy and detail of the resulting maps.",

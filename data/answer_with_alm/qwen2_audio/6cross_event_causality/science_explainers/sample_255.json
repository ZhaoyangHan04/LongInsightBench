The table comparing tactics used by evolution denialists and germ theory denialists is likely inspired by events related to the history and controversies surrounding these theories. \n\nEvent 6 discusses Bill Maher's quotes and how they may be perceived as attacks on the credibility of scientists like Louis Pasteur. This could have prompted the narrator to consider tactics that involve questioning the credibility of those who support established scientific theories.\n\nEvent 9 discusses the concept of \"soft\" forms of germ-theory denialism, which may involve shifting blame away from pathogens and onto the individual's state of health. This could also be seen as a tactic used by proponents of alternative medicine, which often seeks to downplay the role of pathogens in causing illness.\n\nFinally, Event 2 discusses the historical debate between Louis Pasteur and Pierre BÃ©champ over the nature of microorganisms, which could have led the narrator to consider the ways in which proponents of different scientific theories may use tactics such as cherry-picking evidence or misinterpreting data to support their positions.",

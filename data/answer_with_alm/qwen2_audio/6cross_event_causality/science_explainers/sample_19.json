This eventually leads to the decision to create a 'remedial classroom' skit.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is: C: The earlier correction about rockets and announcement of today's focus, setting an instructional tone (event_id 2).\n\nThis event seems to be the most likely trigger for the subsequent formula-based explanation, as it sets the context for discussing scientific concepts like horizon distance, gravity, and buoyancy. Additionally, the mention of correcting previous statements about rockets and establishing the day's topic aligns well with the content of the later sub-events described in the question.",

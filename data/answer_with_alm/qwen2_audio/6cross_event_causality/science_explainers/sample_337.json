The detailed description in event 1 audio about the patient playing Mario Kart and hitting Donkey Kong with a green shell showcases the capabilities enabled by Neuralink. Finally, the demonstration time explanation in event 2 audio highlights how Neuralink allows for faster and more precise movements, which is necessary for playing games like Mario Kart. These events collectively lead up to the live demonstration of Neuralink's gaming capabilities in event 2.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A/B/C/D\n\nThe flight log suddenly reestablishing real-time GPS and showing the plane almost at its destination could have been caused by several preceding events/sub-events including:\n\nA) Event 12 — The described “compromise” where GPS is disabled for certain flights and later reactivated to conceal portions of the route.\nB) Event 8 — The pattern that flights are dropped off GPS over ocean but are perfectly tracked again when over land.\nC) Event 5 — The observation that when watching coastlines, planes seem to vanish over oceans because “GPS makes it disappear.”\n\nAll these events are related to the use and manipulation of GPS technology, which could potentially cause discrepancies in flight tracking data.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible prior events/sub-events leading to the statement in event 11 are:\n\nA: Event 8 - The discussion about how flights are tracked differently over land and sea raises questions about why they are not tracked consistently over the entire journey, including over the Southern Ocean.\nB: Event 9 - The Vanishing Plane Act in the South Atlantic highlights the possibility of flights disappearing without a trace, which could be used to hide information or manipulate data.\nC: Event 10 - The reflection on the limitations of tracking flights only over certain regions prompts a consideration of whether there are other factors at play that could affect the accuracy or reliability of GPS data over the Southern Ocean.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer(s) are A, B, and C.",

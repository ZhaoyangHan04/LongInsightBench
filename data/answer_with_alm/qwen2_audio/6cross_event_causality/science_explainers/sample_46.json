    "model_answer": "The relevant segment is D: Event 10, where it is explained that high-frequency fighter radars often require analog beam-forming, with TR modules grouped and controlled via DAC/ADC. This requires components that may not be available at higher frequencies, setting a limitation on the speed and capabilities of these radars.",

    "model_answer": "The direct motivation for the evaluation of the 'worth it' aspect in event 14 is likely influenced by the challenges associated with GaAs/GaN technology as discussed in event 4, including their complexity and cost, along with the need for liquid cooling due to the high power density of active components. These factors would have implications on the feasibility and practicality of using AESA technology in certain applications. Therefore, option A seems like the most likely answer.",

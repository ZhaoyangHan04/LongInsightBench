    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are B/C.\n\nOption B describes the HRNet-style, multi-scale enhancement network with rendering-aware de-normalization (RAD) which replaces batch norm, leading to improved stability and reduced artifacts. Option C mentions decreasing the discriminator's field of view to reduce content mismatch, also contributing to increased stability.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Training the enhancement approach on real-world imagery from Cityscapes to achieve semantic and geometric consistency when modifying GTA V.\nExplanation: The passage states that the enhancement method was trained on real-world imagery from Cityscapes to achieve semantic and geometric consistency. This means that the model learned to recognize and preserve real-world objects and their relationships in images, which directly contributed to the improved color realism and clarity observed in event 9. Options A, B, and D do not mention the use of real-world imagery or the training process used for the enhancement method.",

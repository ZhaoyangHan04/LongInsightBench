    "model_answer": "The answer is B: Event 4. In event 4, the narrator describes her personal experience using a pH-stabilizing spritz and how she uses it between washes to break up built-up scalp oil. This directly provides the rationale for the presentation of the pH-4 spritz in event 7. Additionally, the demonstration of spraying and massaging the spritz into hair also helps to illustrate how it can be used as a hair care product.",

    "model_answer": "The most direct event leading to the conclusion about diluting ACV for hair was Event 2: The explanation (with molecular model and scalp/bacteria visuals) that ACV’s acetic acid cleans without disturbing the scalp’s natural acidic environment and kills bacteria. This event provided scientific evidence that supports using ACV on the hair, which led to the recommendation to dilute it in a safe acidic range.",

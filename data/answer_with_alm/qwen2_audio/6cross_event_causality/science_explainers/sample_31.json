    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 2’s proposal of a solar sail to explain the odd, non-gravitational velocity change, paired with visuals of the Expected vs. Observed trajectory and a large reflective sheet in space. This proposal introduced the concept of a solar sail as a possible explanation for the observed motion of the object, which led to the speaker's contemplation of whether such an object could naturally form in the galaxy. The other events mentioned may have contributed to the discussion, but they were not the direct cause of the speaker's thoughts on solar sails.",

    "model_answer": "The earlier sub-event that most directly built the rationale for the speaker's conclusion in event 11 is option D: Event 7 - Video: Percival Lowell in 1914 adjusting a telescope. Percival Lowell was an astronomer who became interested in the existence of Planet X, which he believed would explain the unusual movements of Uranus and Neptune. He spent many years searching for this planet using his telescope, and although he did not find it, his work contributed to the scientific interest in the topic of extra-solar planets and the search for exoplanets.",

    "model_answer": "The preceding sub-event most likely prompting the speaker's skeptical, open-ended stance is option D: Event 2 â€” Audio: Sumerian descriptions of a failing planet with a burning moon causing chaos; Video: diagram showing a hypothetical Nibiru orbit in red, far beyond Pluto. This event introduces the concept of a lost planet called Nibiru, which has been described in ancient texts and has led to various interpretations and theories about its existence and location. The speaker's remarks suggest that these earlier assumptions were based on inaccurate or incomplete information and highlight the limitations of our current knowledge.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: Event 5: Discussion of Sagittarius A* and the M87 black hole with corresponding galaxy and black-hole visuals, highlighting massive objects at galactic centers.\n\nThis event discusses two massive objects in our universe, which are large in size when compared to other objects in the universe. This helps establish the scale of the largest structures in the universe. Additionally, it mentions that these objects are found at the centers of galaxies, which provides an observational basis for the discussion of the largest structures.\n\nFurthermore, the event introduces the concept of the cosmological principle, which is a theoretical framework that attempts to explain the observed large-scale structure of the universe. The cosmological principle suggests that the universe has a certain uniformity and is expanding in all directions, but it does not provide a complete explanation for the formation of the largest structures. This creates a theoretical tension that is discussed in the video.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most relevant to the question as it directly addresses the scale, observational basis, and theoretical tension of the largest structures in the universe.",

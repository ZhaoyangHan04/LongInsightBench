    "model_answer": "The preceding events that most directly caused or motivated the site selection decisions were likely A) Event 7: Experts agree underground geological disposal is the best option for high-level waste and spent nuclear fuel, B) Event 5: The hazards and longevity of radioactive waste from nuclear power generation are emphasized, and D) Event 2: Explanation of radioactive decay and half-lives and the six classes of waste. These events provided information about the dangers and management needs of radioactive waste, which likely influenced the decision to select an underground geological disposal facility. The visuals of tunnels, engineering models, and an empty industrial room may have also been influential, but they are not direct causes or motivations for the site selection process.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A, B, C, D\nAll four preceding events contributed to the need for coordinated international assistance on waste management. Event 1 highlighted the generation of radioactive waste from nuclear technologies, emphasizing the importance of safety and security from the start. Event 3 focused on waste handling and disposal within facilities, ensuring proper controls and procedures. Event 4 discussed centralized processing and disposal methods, including volume reduction and encapsulation, as well as near-surface disposal practices. Event 12 emphasized the increasing use of nuclear technologies and the resulting increase in radioactive waste, highlighting the urgency of finding solutions for safe management. Together, these events demonstrated the complex and pressing nature of the issue, making international cooperation essential.",

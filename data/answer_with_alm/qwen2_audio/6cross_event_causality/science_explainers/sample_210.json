    "model_answer": "The direct cause of the narrator's conclusion is likely due to events B and C. Event 5 explains that mineralized fossils lack original carbon, making radiocarbon dating unreliable for such specimens. This means that any carbon found in the fossil may be due to contamination rather than the fossil itself. Event 3 mentions stories about snails and a \"1300-year-old seal\" that were used to challenge carbon dating, indicating that there are examples of people using similar tactics to contest the validity of carbon dating. These events suggest that creationists may use similar tactics to dispute the findings of scientific studies, including carbon dating. Therefore, the narrator's conclusion may have been influenced by these previous events and their implications for the reliability of carbon dating.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A, B, and C. These events directly led to the speaker's conclusion about the limitations of carbon dating and its suitability for different carbon sources. In event 3, the narrator highlighted the problems with carbon dating marine organisms due to the reservoir effect. In event 1, the presentation explained how fictitious results could occur when using mollusk shells as samples. And in event 2, the discussion on carbon filtering and dissolution in plants and rocks explained how these processes could affect the accuracy of carbon dating.",

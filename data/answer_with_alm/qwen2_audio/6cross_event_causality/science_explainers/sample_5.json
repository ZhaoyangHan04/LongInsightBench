    "model_answer": "The prior sub-event that most strongly justifies proposing a shutdown scenario is A: Event 6. The audio warns that a large solar storm could cause power and internet outages for several months or even years, which would have highly destructive effects on humans and the earth indirectly. This event emphasizes the potential for widespread disruption of essential services, including power and internet, which are crucial for modern society. The other events do not provide the same level of urgency or direct relevance to the need for shutting down global electricity.",

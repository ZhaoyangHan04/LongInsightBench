    "model_answer": "The events leading up to the speaker's conclusion about the lack of non-stop flights between Southern Hemisphere city pairs were likely (A) and (B), as these events involved observing the distances and routing of flights between different cities. This information could have led the speaker to notice the long distances and complex itineraries required to travel between certain Southern Hemisphere destinations, supporting their argument about the difficulty in finding non-stop flights. Option (C) does not seem directly related to the topic of flight routes, while option (D) is simply a mention of resources available to the speaker, which does not provide any context for their conclusion.",

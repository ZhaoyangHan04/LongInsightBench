    "model_answer": "The answer must have occurred before the host signing off, as the buzzing and popping sound are heard immediately afterwards. Of the above events, only Event 7 involves the charged capacitor being dumped into a primary coil, which could potentially generate the necessary voltage for a spark. This event occurs before the host signs off, making it the most likely candidate for setting up the conditions for the audible buzz/pop. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Event 7.",

    "model_answer": "I would select events B and C as they both illustrate the process of replacing less accurate models with more accurate ones over time. The Eratosthenes measurement and the subsequent corrections to the shape of the Earth show how observations can lead to improvements in scientific understanding. Similarly, the development of more precise instruments like the Vanguard 1 satellite allowed for even more accurate measurements, leading to further refinements in models. These events demonstrate the iterative process of science, where initial theories are refined and improved upon as new evidence emerges.",

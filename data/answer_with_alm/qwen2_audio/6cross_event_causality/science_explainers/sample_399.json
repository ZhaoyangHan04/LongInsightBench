    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on mathematics for help. The video starts with a description of Archimedes' method of exhaustion, which was used to calculate the area under a curve. This method was presented as a solution to the problem of finding the area of a circle, which had puzzled mathematicians for centuries. Therefore, option C, the conversation about circles, rectangles, and early mathematicians' challenges, is the most relevant event that prompted the discussion of Archimedes' approach and the display of his book.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

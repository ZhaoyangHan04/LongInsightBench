    "model_answer": "The answer must explain how pair production is related to the other events. Events 7 and 8 establish the concept of matter and energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²), which implies that antimatter can be created from energy. Event 3 explains the fundamental principles of electric charge, which causes attraction between oppositely charged particles and repulsion between like charged particles. This knowledge is necessary to understand how pair production works. Therefore, the correct answer is A, B, C, and D.",

    "model_answer": "The events that led to presenting Penning traps as the solution for containing antimatter were: C: Event 9: Explanation of pair production near a nucleus, which created particle-antiparticle pairs; D: Event 5: Diagram comparing matter and antimatter particles, including positrons; A: Event 10: On-screen question about how to contain antimatter and narration explaining that it cannot be placed in boxes due to annihilation and radiation; B: Event 11: Visuals of a magnetic field grid and charge icons, which helped illustrate how electric and magnetic fields could be used to control and trap charged particles away from ordinary matter. These events provided the necessary background information and concepts needed to understand how Penning traps could be used to contain antimatter.",

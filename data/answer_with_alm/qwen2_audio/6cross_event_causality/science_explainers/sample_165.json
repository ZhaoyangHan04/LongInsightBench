This event lays the foundation for understanding the periodic table's structure and behavior, which is essential for explaining the filling of the table as described in event 4.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible explanations for the conclusions drawn in event 6 are B and C. Option A does not seem to be directly related to the electron configurations of lithium and sodium. Option D, which involves a graphic展示 of elements, does not appear to be relevant to the specific discussion of sodium's properties. However, both events B and C provide foundational knowledge necessary to understand the electron configuration and properties of sodium, as well as its position in the periodic table. Therefore, they are most likely the sub-events that led to the conclusions drawn in event 6.",

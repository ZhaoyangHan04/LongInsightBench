    "model_answer": "Answer: A, B, C, D\nAll four events challenge mainstream narratives by presenting alternative explanations or interpretations of historical events or scientific theories. The aerial view in Event 3 challenges the conventional wisdom that pyramids in Europe are from a different time period than those in Egypt. Event 5 questions the idea of progress by showing how little has changed in rural areas despite technological advancements. Event 7 challenges the idea of humans being the only ones capable of creating large structures like the perfectly even basalt slabs. And Event 8 questions the accepted timeline for prehistoric art by presenting evidence of dinosaurs in paintings and reliefs much older than previously thought.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is: C: Event 10: The Patom crater segment showing aerial views and on-screen text suggesting a nuclear-like event based on tree-ring radioisotope spikes, as narrated in a mysterious tone.\n\nThis segment sets up the conclusion by presenting an out-of-place discovery in the form of a crater with unusual radioisotope readings, which could be interpreted as evidence of a nuclear explosion or other catastrophic event. This is followed by a mysterious tone and narration, suggesting that the find is anomalous and may require further investigation. This sets the stage for the idea that the blackened humanoid figure found later could be connected to this event, making it seem like an anomaly within the context of the preceding events.",

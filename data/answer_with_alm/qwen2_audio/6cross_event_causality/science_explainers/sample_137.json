    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 1: Mapping shows West Antarcticaâ€™s thin crust and tectonic faults releasing heat beneath Thwaites Glacier, indicating high geothermal heat flow in a tectonic trench. This event directly contributes to the concentration of melt in the West Antarctic region as it provides evidence of high geothermal heat flow beneath the glacier. The other events may also play a role in the melting process, but they are not direct contributors to the concentration of melt in the West Antarctic region.",

    "model_answer": "The events that most directly set up and explain how the device could work at sea are A: Event 8 and B: Event 9. \n\nEvent 8 provides background on the concept of capturing CO2 from seawater, explaining that oceans are a significant carbon sink and scientists are researching methods to remove CO2 from seawater. This lays the foundation for understanding how the device could potentially be used to capture CO2 from the ocean.\n\nEvent 9 builds upon this by explaining that reducing the concentration of CO2 in seawater makes it more buoyant, allowing it to float to the surface and be removed. This ties into the idea of using seawater capture technology to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, as the reduced CO2 concentration in seawater would make it easier to collect and process.\n\nTogether, these two events establish the context and principles behind the use of seawater capture technology for carbon removal, making it more likely that the device discussed in Event 10 could be effective when used at sea.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 2: The narrator explains how trees act as carbon sinks via photosynthesis and shows forests and tree planting, establishing that plants pull CO2 from the air. This event provides the foundation for understanding how bioenergy with carbon capture and storage works by utilizing trees and other vegetation to absorb CO2 through photosynthesis. The subsequent events (3, 4, and 7) build upon this foundation by discussing specific strategies for enhancing carbon sequestration in forests, soils, and agricultural systems, but they ultimately rely on the initial understanding of plant-based carbon sinks established in Event 2.",

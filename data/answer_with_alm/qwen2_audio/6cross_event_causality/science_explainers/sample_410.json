    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Event 6 sub-event: Display of U.S. Code § 6426 (tax credits for biofuels) with narration that subsidies helped biodiesel reach cost parity. B: Event 7 sub-event: Statement that California toughened emissions rules requiring cleaner-burning fuel, boosting demand for biodiesel. C: Event 10 sub-event: Department of Energy podium speech announcing research grants to study alternative biofuel sources. D: Event 3 sub-event: Explanation that fuel retailers have slim margins and gas stations don’t profit from fuel sales.\n\nThe display of U.S. Code § 6426 (tax credits for biofuels) in Event 6 likely contributed to biodiesel's cost parity by reducing its production costs through government support. The toughening of emissions rules in Event 7 increased the demand for cleaner-burning fuels like biodiesel, further driving down its costs as it became more competitive with traditional fossil fuels. The Department of Energy's research grants in Event 10 may also have supported the development of new technologies that made biodiesel more efficient and cost-effective. Additionally, the fact that fuel retailers have slim margins and don't profit from fuel sales means that any reduction in the cost of biodiesel would lead",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Event 7 sub-event: Narration that California has toughened emissions rules requiring fewer emissions and cleaner-burning fuel. B: Event 2 sub-event: Visuals of B20 labeling and CO2 from a car, with narration that biofuels (like B20) reduce emissions. C: Event 1 sub-event: Narration that the biofuel industry is geared toward biodiesel for trucks, buses, and farm equipment rather than personal cars. D: Event 12 sub-event: Narration that increased drilling and fracking lowered oil prices and squeezed biofuel margins.\n\nThe audio mentions that California has toughened emissions rules and reduced costs, making biofuels look like a viable option to compete with traditional fuels. This increase in demand for biofuels likely led to new regulations for public transportation networks in California. Additionally, the visuals of B20 labeling and CO2 emissions from a car further emphasize the environmental benefits of using biofuels, which could have contributed to the new requirements. The mention of increased drilling and fracking lowering oil prices also suggests that traditional fossil fuels were becoming cheaper, which could have made it harder for biofuels to compete. However, this factor does not directly relate to the new biofuel usage requirements",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A, B, C, D. All four events demonstrate the concept of superelasticity and its associated behaviors, which include the ability of certain materials like nitinol to deform and then snap back to their original shape. This property is due to changes in the crystal structure of these materials, such as the formation of twins or the shifting of atoms into different positions. The examples provided show how heat, pressure, and temperature can affect these structures and lead to reversible deformation.",

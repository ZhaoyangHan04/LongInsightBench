    "model_answer": "I selected events A, B, and C because they each contribute to the argument that controlling AI is necessary due to its capabilities and potential risks. The neuron close-ups and operating-room visuals in event A demonstrate the capability of Neuralink to read and translate brain signals, which could be used to control AI. Event B highlights the concerns about losing control of AI when it is connected to the cloud, as well as the potential for abuse of power by those in control. Event C builds on this by mentioning the upcoming human trials of Neuralink's technology, suggesting that the company is moving closer to making AI controllable.",

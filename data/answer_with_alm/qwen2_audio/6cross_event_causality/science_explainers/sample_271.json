Events 3 and 4 also played a role by influencing the speaker's perspective on Wikipedia and the curvature formula respectively, but they were not the immediate triggers for sharing Eric Dubayâ€™s clip.",

These events likely prompted the speaker to consider demonstrating the curvature of the Earth experimentally, particularly given the misleading information that appears when searching for it online.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 7: The speaker explains radio frequency causes thermolysis to the dermis and hypodermis without injuring the epidermis, describing the skin layers and their functions. This explanation sets up the idea that radio frequency can heat the skin and cause fat loss by breaking down fat cells. Option B also supports this conclusion by explaining how radio frequency heats the lower skin layers, but it does not specifically mention fat loss. Option C mentions facial fat but does not directly relate to the science behind radio frequency. Option D does not mention radio frequency at all.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: C: Event 11: The host notes professional treatments give better results but carry increased risks—including facial fat loss—and that side effects “can and do happen.”\n\nThe host's remarks in Event 11 emphasize the potential risks associated with professional RF treatments, including facial fat loss, which aligns with the concerns raised about RF skin-tightening in Event 12. This indicates that the host has been considering the potential side effects of RF treatments and wants to highlight them to their audience.",

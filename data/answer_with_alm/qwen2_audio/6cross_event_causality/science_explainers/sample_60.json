He then lit it, resulting in the loud final detonation and lid blow-off. This event directly sets up and causes the loud final detonation and lid blow-off.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are B and C.\nExplanation: The delay in the reaction of the Canadian firecrackers could be attributed to their unique design, which has small holes along the sides (Event 4). This design may affect how the firecracker burns and releases heat and gas. Additionally, the fact that a single Canadian firecracker only sparks and cracks (Event 5) without a loud noise suggests it may have less explosive material, which could also contribute to the delay in its reaction. Option A does not seem directly related to the observed delay, and Option D is not mentioned in relation to the events described.",

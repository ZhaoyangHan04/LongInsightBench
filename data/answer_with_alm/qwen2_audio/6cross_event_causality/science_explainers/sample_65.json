    "model_answer": "Answer: A/B/C/D\nEvent 8 led to the decline of Lysenko's influence as state-backed suppression loosened and the scientific community's dissent resurfaced. This allowed for a reevaluation of Lysenko's ideas and his rejection by the scientific community. Event 9, with its earlier sub-event, contributed to this reevaluation by allowing for公开批评 of Lysenko and his supporters. Event 5 helped establish the foundation for modern genetics, which directly contradicted Lysenko's ideas. Finally, Event 6 saw Lysenko reject the gene/DNA framework, further solidifying his opposition to the scientific consensus.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 8: Government-backed propaganda for Lysenko, suppression of dissenting scientists, and the decline of his influence after Stalin’s death, illustrating the damage when politics controls science. This event shows how government interference and suppression of scientific dissent can lead to a decline in scientific progress and the spread of false ideas. It also highlights the importance of protecting freedom of inquiry and allowing scientists to challenge prevailing beliefs without fear of retribution.",

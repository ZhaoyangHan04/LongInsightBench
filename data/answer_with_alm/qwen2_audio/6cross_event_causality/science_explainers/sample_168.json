However, based solely on the provided options, I would select A and C. The visualizations of satellite altimetry and global plate-boundary maps mentioned in event 7 seem to contradict the speaker's claim that the earth is not expanding. Similarly, the 'pair production' / 'prime matter' mechanism discussed in event 3 appears to be at odds with established physics and could potentially challenge the validity of Adams and Maxlow's hypothesis.",

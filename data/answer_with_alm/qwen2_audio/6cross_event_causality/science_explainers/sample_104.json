This step directly led to the formation of saltwater with a near-neutral pH reading. \n\nOption A (Event 9) describes the combination method but does not mention the mixing process itself. Option C (Event 2) provides an overview of the presentation but does not describe any specific step. Option D (Event 6) provides background information on pH values but does not relate specifically to the events described in the audio.",

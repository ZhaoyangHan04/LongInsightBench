    "model_answer": "The loud crackling sound in event 4 was most likely caused by step C: Using a thick wire to short a battery just before the crackle, as this creates a high electrical potential difference between two points which could generate a spark. The other events may have some indirect impact on the conditions leading up to the spark, but they are not direct causes of the crackling sound.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is likely A, B, and C. These events establish the necessary conditions for the probe to register high readings, which could be due to the interaction of the magnets from the assembled test piece and the Gauss meter probe. The movement of the probe might also cause intermittent contact with the magnets, leading to erratic readings. Option D does not seem directly related to the setup of the experiment that would lead to such readings.",

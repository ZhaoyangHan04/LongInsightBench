    "model_answer": "The events that most directly set up the fasting-and-GKI conclusion are:\n\nB: Event 3: The energy-starvation pathway diagram and narration showing AMPK activation under low energy, mTORC1 inhibition, and promotion of autophagy. This provides background on the physiological state that triggers autophagy in response to low energy levels.\n\nC: Event 7: The insulin-response graph for carbohydrate/protein/fat and narration that any macronutrient calories suppress autophagy and raise mTOR/insulin (fat least, but still lowers need for autophagy). This establishes that insulin, particularly from carbohydrates and proteins, can inhibit autophagy by activating mTORC1.\n\nTherefore, the combination of these two events provides the necessary context for understanding how fasting and the GKI index relate to autophagy activation.",

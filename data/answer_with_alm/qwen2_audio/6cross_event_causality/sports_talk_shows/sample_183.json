    "model_answer": "The events that most directly built to the assessment that Drew might be the biggest heel in WWE right now are:\n\nC: Event 11: The host’s heated reaction to Drew’s behavior—specifically mocking injuries, provocative promos, and Meek Mill music—which underlined how far the antagonism has gone.\n\nThis event showed the host's strong negative reaction to Drew's actions and promos, which played a significant role in building the perception of him as a heel in the WWE. The other events mentioned may have contributed to this perception, but they were not as directly relevant to the assessment of Drew being the biggest heel right now.",

This goal led to a more intense and exciting finish to regulation time, which contributed to the overtime period and ultimately the Montreal win.",

    "model_answer": "Option B: The replay/commentary emphasizing the swing that caught the ref and describing the wrestler blowing kisses to the crowd most plausibly triggered the wrestler in black-and-gold to celebrate and taunt the crowd (mocking, kisses/middle fingers).\n\nThis option is supported by the context of the audio where the commentator describes the moment when the wrestler gets the rebound, pushes it down the floor, and then taunts the crowd. This sequence of events seems to be directly linked to the commentator's description of the previous play, which involved a controversial swing that missed the opponent but hit the referee. Additionally, the reference to the wrestler blowing kisses to the crowd could also be a direct reference to this incident, adding to the likelihood that it was the cause of the wrestler's celebration and taunting.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 1: The coach’s audio warning that Peekaboo isn’t for everyone—requiring time, focus, and muscle memory—while visually guiding pad work and tire shots, underscoring repetition and deliberate practice. This event emphasizes the importance of repetition and deliberate practice, which are crucial for improving accuracy and power in boxing.

    "model_answer": "The events that most directly set up and drive the host's climactic shout of \"You're fired!\" at Vince are:\n\nA: Event 3: The split-screen segment showing Sean Ross Sapp’s tweet announcing Vince’s resignation while the host audibly outlines memo details. This event highlights the public announcement of Vince's departure from the company, which sets the stage for the subsequent events.\n\nB: Event 5: The on-screen resignation statement is read, and the host explicitly jokes that Vince is “getting hit with the you’re fired.” This event adds humor to the situation and emphasizes the irony of Vince being fired after his own resignation was announced.\n\nC: Event 0: The opening celebration where the host, visibly animated, repeatedly cheers that Vince is gone over jubilant music. This event establishes the tone of the show and sets the expectation for a celebratory mood, which contrasts sharply with the dramatic moment of Vince's firing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, B, and C.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Event 1: The explanation that Slim Jim distanced itself from WWE, triggering caution among board members and a chain of events, highlighting real-world consequences.\n\nThis event likely led to a sober assessment in event 8 because it highlighted the potential real-world consequences of Vince's power abuses, which could have prompted the host to take a more serious tone in his analysis. The other events may have contributed to the shift in tone, but they were not the primary cause.",

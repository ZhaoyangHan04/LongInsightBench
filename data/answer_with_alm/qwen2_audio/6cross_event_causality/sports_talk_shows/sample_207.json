    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A, B, C, D.\nEvent 4 explains a side \"sacrificing throw,\" contrasts it with Sumi Gaeshi, and compares Yokowakare vs. Yokogake (pushing to the corner, going to the side, throwing forward with opponent landing on the back). This provides context for understanding the side-blocking motion executed in Event 6.\nEvent 5 offers a visual demonstration labeled \"Yoko-wakare,\" emphasizing lower-body interaction (leg/foot positioning) and sleeve/arm work for separating to the side. This helps clarify the technique being performed in Event 6.\nEvent 6 itself sets up the comparison by noting a \"Mongolian Judoka,\" the athlete \"flattening herself to the side,\" and a \"side-blocking foot sweeping motion,\" clarifying how Yokowakare differs from other techniques.\nFinally, Event 7 discusses variations of yoko gake and o yoko wakare, including ankle slapping and nogi ease, which build upon the foundation laid in earlier events and help inform the execution of the technique in Event 6.",

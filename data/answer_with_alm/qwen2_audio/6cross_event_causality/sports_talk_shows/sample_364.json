    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 1: The 'Good' segment where Solo Sikoa’s violent beatdown is shown (table spot on the Y2J-labeled wrestler) and the audio praises Solo while noting Tama Tonga’s surprise arrival and that Rock/Roman are away, hinting at internal Bloodline shifts.\nThis segment shows the intense and dramatic nature of the Bloodline angle, which has been a key part of WWE programming for several months. The violence and the sudden arrival of Tama Tonga add to the sense of chaos and turmoil within the group. Additionally, the mention of Roman Reigns and The Rock being away implies that there may be power struggles and shifting alliances within the Bloodline, which could lead to further developments in the storyline. This segment sets the stage for the events leading up to Event 6 and the subsequent discussion about the Bloodline angle.",

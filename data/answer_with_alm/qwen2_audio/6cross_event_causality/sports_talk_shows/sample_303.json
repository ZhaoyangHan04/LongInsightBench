Events 2, 4, and 5 may have indirectly influenced the outcome by affecting the strategies and performances of other drivers during the session.

This could lead to last-second pack releases and changes in strategy that could affect the timing of events.\n- Event 8: The reports about Bowman/Elliott seeing the flag and being unable to complete the next lap could have contributed to the perception that there was a problem with the timing system.

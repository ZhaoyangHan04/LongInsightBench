    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 3 â€“ She introduces deodorant, shows a blue stick on camera, and on-screen text warns that sweat produces stink, stressing odor control before playing. This event directly sets up the recommendation for bringing an extra shirt as it highlights the issue of sweat and odor control. The other events may also have some relevance, but they are not as directly linked to the recommendation for extra shirts.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A and B. Option A suggests that she has been at the venue for long stretches and hence would need something to do during downtime, which could lead to her recommending bringing a book. Option B also implies that she has been at the venue for some time and has experienced hunger, leading her to suggest bringing snacks. Both of these events build up the context for her later advice about bringing money to the volleyball tournament.",

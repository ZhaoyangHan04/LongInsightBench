Option A mentions Travis putting a rider on the spot, which may have contributed to the rider's nerves but does not directly set up the drop. Option C mentions the DAY OF THE FIRST EVENT being displayed on-screen, which could be relevant for timing but does not provide specific details about the drop. Option D mentions a speaker discussing the event next year, which is unrelated to the immediate events of the day.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: (event 4) The on-screen Fabrizio Romano tweet confirming Chelsea–Leicester talks for Ben Chilwell and naming Nicolas Tagliafico as Chelsea’s option if the Chilwell deal collapses, while the host discusses Lampard’s priority at left back.\n\nThe preceding sub-event that most directly led to the on-air commitment to provide updates was Event 4, where the host discussed the ongoing negotiations for Ben Chilwell and revealed that Chelsea had also set their sights on Nicolas Tagliafico as an alternative option. This information prompted the host to promise to keep viewers updated on the developments of these negotiations.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible causes of the comparison graphic between Ben Chilwell and Nicolás Tagliafico are events (B) and (C). Option (B) is directly related as it mentions that Tagliafico is on Chelsea's list if the Chilwell deal falls through. Option (C) also seems relevant as it highlights the high price tag for left-backs, which could have influenced Chelsea's interest in both players. Options (A) and (D) do not seem to be directly related to the comparison graphic.",

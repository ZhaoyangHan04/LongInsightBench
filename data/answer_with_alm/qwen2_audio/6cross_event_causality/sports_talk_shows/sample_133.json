    "model_answer": "The most direct preceding events leading to the overturned home run decision in event 11 were likely option B (the ball striking the fence and caroming toward/into the bullpen on the Soto play) and option C (the Yankees-Red Sox \"pesky pole\" review labeled \"CALL REVIEW #3,\" where a ground-rule double is changed to a home run). These two events involved close calls that likely prompted additional reviews and ultimately led to the overturn of the original call. Option A (the initial home-run moment followed by the umpire halting play) occurred after the fact and was not directly related to the subsequent review process. Option D (a separate sequence analyzing tag plays and possible plate blocking during a slide at home) does not seem to be directly connected to the home run decision either.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Event 3: The “kick and catch” backspin drill—repeat ~100 times with each leg—to build a natural rhythm and reliable first touches.\n\nThis drill helps develop the necessary control and coordination needed for combining foot-and-head touches. By performing it repeatedly, players learn to maintain control of the ball while switching between feet and using their heads effectively. This foundational skill-building exercise lays the groundwork for more advanced techniques like those demonstrated in events 9, 13, and 15.",

    "model_answer": "The instruction in event 8, which advises flexing the foot and curling the toes for the right backspin shape and finding the feel through bouncing the ball, directly sets up the successful performance of a foot stall in event 10. This is because the ability to maintain balance on the foot while explaining toe flexion and shin/ankle tension is crucial for performing a foot stall, which involves keeping the ball on the foot without using hands. The other events provide related but less direct instruction towards this outcome.",

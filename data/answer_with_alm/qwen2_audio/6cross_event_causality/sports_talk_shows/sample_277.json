    "model_answer": "The events that most directly caused or led to the presenter's conclusion about the saddle type are:\n\nA: Event 8 – The critique of the “noseless saddle” concept: excessive rear width drives riders toward a non-existent nose, exposing design issues that undermine stable support.\nC: Event 11 – The explanation that the ISM PM 3.1 is a time-trial/triathlon saddle designed to load the pelvis further forward in a more anteriorly rotated position.\n\nThese events highlighted the limitations and drawbacks of the noseless saddle concept and the need for a saddle that provides better pelvis support, which eventually led to the presenter's negative opinion about its suitability for road bikes. Option B does not seem to be directly related to the presenter's conclusion, while option D discusses the preferences of professional cyclists but does not influence the presenter's view on the noseless saddle for road bikes.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Event 3 – Explaining that riders often sit off to one side due to poor foot support, excessive saddle height or reach, or to relieve soft-tissue pressure—i.e., they sit askew to get comfortable.\n\nThis event directly led to the presenter's conclusion about saddle discomfort, as it highlighted the common issue of riders sitting askew to compensate for other problems such as poor foot support or excessive saddle height. This improper seating position can lead to asymmetrical interaction and ultimately result in sores on the saddle.",

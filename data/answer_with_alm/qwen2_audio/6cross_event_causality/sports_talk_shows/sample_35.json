    "model_answer": "I would select A, B, C, and D as the direct causes or contributing factors leading to the Patriots and Rams moving on to Super Bowl LIII. Each of these events significantly impacted the teams' performance and trajectory towards the championship game. The controversial non-call in Event 11 likely fueled public outrage and discussion, the Rams' impressive form throughout the season contributed to their strong playoff position, the official start of the playoffs provided a clear path for the teams to reach the Super Bowl, and the changes in broadcasting and rule enforcement may have influenced the way the games were played and perceived by fans and analysts.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is likely A and C. Le'Veon Bell's season-long holdout caused backfield turmoil, which negatively impacted the team's performance. Additionally, Baker Mayfield's contributions to Cleveland's success in the division helped tighten the playoff race, although it did not directly cause the Steelers' missed playoffs. Option D, Chicago making the playoffs, does not seem relevant to the Steelers' situation.",

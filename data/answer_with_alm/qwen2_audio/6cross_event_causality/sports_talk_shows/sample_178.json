    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are B and C. The host's initial skepticism is shattered by the realization that the tweet about Aaron Glenn was real, as mentioned in event 1. This leads him to double down on the idea that it wasn't fake and to cite a post-loss scenario as evidence of his disbelief, which is also mentioned in event 3. Option A does not seem to be directly related to the shift in the host's stance, while option D only mentions a later segment without providing any context for the change in the host's perspective.",

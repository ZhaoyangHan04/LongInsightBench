    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 11: The two discuss that they’ve tied in each other’s sports and agree to a Crossbar Challenge (audio explicitly says they tied and proposes the challenge; visuals show the setup and a crossbar hit).\n\nThe discussion about tying in their sports led to the proposal of the Crossbar Challenge as a way to break the tie. This event directly caused the tiebreaker moment to happen. The other options (Event 8, Event 9, and Event 2) may have contributed to the overall preparation or execution of the challenge, but they were not the direct cause of the tiebreaker moment.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: Event 2: NFL-style catch-and-sprint warm-up drill (audio outlines how to make it to the NFL; visuals of sprinting and catching).\n\nThis event involves players practicing catching and sprinting, which helps improve their speed and agility. These skills are essential for goalkeeping, as they allow the goalkeeper to react quickly to shots and crosses. The repetition of this drill will help the goalkeeper develop the reflexes and anticipation needed to make successful saves.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it refers to a different type of drill that does not involve goalkeeping. Option B is also incorrect because it only mentions diving technique instruction, without any mention of a save attempt. Option C is incorrect because it refers to protective gear worn during drills, which may be useful but is not directly related to setting up a successful save in a goalkeeping drill.",

    "model_answer": "I would select A, B, and C as the most plausible developments that led to the opponent's explosive run. \n\nEvent 4: Mike likely took the trash talk personally and felt provoked by KG's continued talking even after his attempts to calm things down. This could have led to increased tension and aggression on his part.\n\nEvent 5: KG's decision to continue talking despite JR's attempts to calm him down could have further fueled the situation and made Mike more angry.\n\nEvent 7: The immediate fallout after the two 10-second violations committed by the team shows that there was a lot of pressure and momentum on the opposing team. This could have contributed to their explosive run.\n\nWhile event D, being tired from the crash and having a large crowd at the game, may have had some impact on the team's performance, it is less likely to be the main cause of the opponent's explosive run.",

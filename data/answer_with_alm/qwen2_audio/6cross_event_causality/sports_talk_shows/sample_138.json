    "model_answer": "The most directly setting events for the evaluation of Rashford were events C and D. In event C, the presenter praised Sancho and Martial and cautioned against getting carried away due to Liverpool's strong team, which implies a comparison between Rashford and other players. In event D, the presenter noted that Liverpool had a young side in their first half, which could influence how they approach matches and could potentially affect Rashford's performance. These events laid the groundwork for the presenter's subsequent critique of Rashford's performance.",

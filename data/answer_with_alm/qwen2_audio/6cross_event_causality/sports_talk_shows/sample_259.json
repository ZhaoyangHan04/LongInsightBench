    "model_answer": "The most direct setup for Vince Carter's breakout season with the Nets was likely option C, his acquisition from the Toronto Raptors via trade, which was discussed in the preceding event (event_id 5). This event introduced the narrative of Carter being dealt to a new team and setting out to prove himself, which aligns with his subsequent aggressive performance and career-year statistics. Options A, B, and D may have contributed to the overall narrative, but they were not central to Carter's transformation into a dominant force in the NBA.",

    "model_answer": "The preceding events that most likely led to the trade of Vince Carter were his dissatisfaction and lack of enjoyment in basketball, as well as the tension in the locker room between him and coach Sam Mitchell. These factors, combined with the negative reactions from fans and poor performance of the team, may have prompted the organization to make a change by trading him to the Nets. Option A, B, C, and D all contribute to this narrative.",

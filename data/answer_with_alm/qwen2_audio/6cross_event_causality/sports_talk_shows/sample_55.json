    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are A, C, and D. These events directly led to the improvement of the arrow grouping:\n\n- Event 1 involved taking the bow square off, tying several knots, and placing an arrow on the string. This established the basic structure of the knocking point.\n- Event 4 was about noticing a discrepancy between the bare shafts and the rest of the arrows. By redoing the knocking point at “6,” Steve ensured consistency in arrow placement.\n- Event 8 involved using super glue and heating the knocking point to make it more secure. This permanently fixed the arrow points in place, contributing to the tight grouping of arrows.\n\nOption B, test-shooting at 30 meters, does not seem to be directly related to the improved arrow grouping.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A, B, C, D. All these events directly led to completing the permanent knocking point. Event 6 involved measuring with a bow square and deciding to make a knocking point with about 15 knots instead of four. This influenced the choice of materials needed for the knocking point. Event 7 was carefully tying the 15-knot knocking point on the bowstring using the techniques shown by Steve. Event 8 involved applying super glue, letting it dry for about 15 minutes, and then heating it to set the permanent knocking point. Finally, Event 3 was shooting at 30 meters right after trimming thread ends to assess accuracy, which helped in ensuring that the knocking point was placed correctly.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible events that set the scene of Asha riding a gray horse toward the palace at sunset are A: Event 4: King Magnifico glares with green-lit eyes in a lab-like setting, visually framing him as a villain while the narration compares him to classic Disney antagonists and B: Event 5: Expository text and narration explain Rosas as a kingdom of wishes where the king selectively decides which wishes are granted, described by the speaker as “pretty evil.” These events establish the setting and atmosphere of the story, which is crucial for understanding the later events, including Asha's journey and the presence of the gray horse.",

    "model_answer": "The most direct explanations for the rope-led action in event 12 are A and C. The glowing blue orbs mentioned in event 3 suggest that the characters are in a room filled with wishes, which could be linked to the ropes and the need for them to ascend into the chamber. Additionally, event 9 establishes a group of friends who could potentially work together to perform a rescue, such as climbing up the ropes. Option B does not seem directly related to the action in event 12, and option D only mentions a stage performance and does not provide any context for the use of ropes.",

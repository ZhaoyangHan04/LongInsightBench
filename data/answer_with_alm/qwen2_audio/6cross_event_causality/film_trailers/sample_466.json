    "model_answer": "The primary contributors to the transformation of the boiler plate bar were events 10, 11, and 12. These events involved diffusing the key, adding haze, and introducing specific colors and lighting to create a moodier tone that better complemented the script's mood. Event 2, keeping the scene in bright flat lighting, did not contribute to this transformation as it resulted in shadows disappearing and a less moody atmosphere.",

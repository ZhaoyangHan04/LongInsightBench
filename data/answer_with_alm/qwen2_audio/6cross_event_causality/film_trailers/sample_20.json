    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 11’s Peanuts montage of seasonal classics with excited kid voices and lines like “I believe in the Great Pumpkin!” and “There is an Easter Beagle!” highlighting many titles on DVD/video. This scene sets up the theme of the importance of Peanuts in pop culture and creates excitement for the upcoming release of the DVD and video titles. It also provides a glimpse into the fun and memorable moments that make Peanuts such a beloved franchise. The other events may build anticipation or promote specific titles, but they do not directly set up the final Peanuts call-to-action as effectively as the seasonal classics montage.",

The VHS lineup and Oswald's enthusiastic line also contribute to building excitement.\n\nEvent 6 introduces \"Outdoors with Oswald,\" showcasing his adventures and making him a household name.

    "model_answer": "The answer is D: Event 0: The intro to Part 20 of the trailer rebuild and the theme song about Lone Star Rider raising money and making friends. \n\nIn the audio, the host mentions that they'll stick around after the public reveal of the BSG WRAPS website, email, phone number, and Fort Worth location. This implies that they have already received this information beforehand, likely from the theme song or an earlier part of the event where they discussed the project and its goals.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 0 — Audio declares Bill is livid and promises to pay Thomas a visit he won't forget, warning “don’t mess with a Spencer.” This event sets the tone for Bill's angry and vengeful personality, which leads to his eventual confrontation with Thomas at the hospital. The other events may contribute to the situation, but they are not the direct cause of the hospital confrontation.",

    "model_answer": "The events that most directly motivate and set up Ridge visiting Flo in jail are A and C. Option A mentions Ridge's angry reaction to Flo and his determination to find answers, which suggests that his visit to Flo is motivated by his desire to confront her and get to the bottom of things. Option C confirms that Ridge did go to see Flo after storming out of the previous scene, which supports the idea that his visit was driven by his anger and frustration. Options B and D do not seem to be directly related to Ridge's visit to Flo in jail.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible prior sub-event causing the street celebration is option B: Event 1: A sports announcer excitedly declares a home run and that the Cardinals have won, accompanied by a cheering crowd. This event implies that there was a significant moment in a game involving the Cardinals that led to excitement and celebration among fans, including the two men in the dark suits. The mention of a Yankees crowd and extra innings also suggests that the men may be fans of the New York Yankees, adding to the likelihood that they were celebrating a victory by their team.",

    "model_answer": "The most direct lead-up to the woman's decision to leave in event 4 was event 3, where she confronted the men about their behavior and referred to them derogatively. This confrontation likely caused her to re-evaluate her relationship with them and decide that it was time to leave. Events 1, 2, and 0 may have contributed to the overall atmosphere of irresponsibility and chaos that led up to this moment, but they were not the specific cause of her decision to leave.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible answer is D: Events 6-7 – He edited in Final Cut using the multicam feature and began grading with color wheels to drop exposure slightly. This suggests that during the editing process, the creator may have noticed issues with sharpness in certain shots, leading him to adjust the exposure using color wheels in an attempt to improve the overall image quality. The fact that he mentions using a simple two-light setup with a hard backlight further supports the idea that he was focused on achieving a particular aesthetic rather than sharpness.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Events 6-7 – He used Final Cut’s multicam feature and began the grade by lowering exposure slightly with color wheels.\nThe use of multicam and color grading techniques in events 6 and 7 likely influenced the contrasty, moody look that was achieved during grading. By adjusting the exposure and colors, the creator could enhance the mood of the band footage and create a visual style that matched their vision. This process would have involved using tools like the color wheels in Final Cut Pro to adjust the colors and tones of the video.",

    "model_answer": "I would select A, B, C, and D because each of these events contributed uniquely to the success of the ad campaign. The memorable spokesperson built brand equity and helped bridge to conversion content through Event 3. Event 4 effectively portrayed a friendly, non-threatening version of danger, which resonated with audiences. Event 6's decision to use a Zoom/iPhone look and maintain authenticity during COVID constraints added a fresh and relatable touch to the ad. Finally, the early mention of SimpliSafe's features and rebellious tone in Event 1 set the stage for the brand's unique selling points and helped generate interest in the product.",

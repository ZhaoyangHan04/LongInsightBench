    "model_answer": "The events that most directly set up Carly’s surprise arrival at the father-daughter dance are D: Event 4 (earlier sub-event), where Carly mentions on the phone that the dance is important for a father-daughter relationship and she doesn't want to go with anyone else, and C: Event 2, where her stand-in date becomes too sick to attend, which leaves Carly without a partner. Therefore, option D provides the necessary context for understanding Carly's reaction when her father arrives, and option C sets the stage for the absence of her original planned date.",

While the other events may have contributed to her desire to spend time with her family, it was the specific timing of her dad’s departure and the offer of the motorcycle that made her decide to go to Italy.",

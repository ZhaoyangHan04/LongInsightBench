In event 7, the uniformed man mentions that the suspect could leave the country on conditions, which implies that the situation has escalated and reached a critical point. In event 8, the suspect refuses to sign a false statement, indicating that he is refusing to cooperate with the authorities, which could be seen as a direct threat to the uniformed man's authority.

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Event 9: An announcer explicitly says Lightning McQueen is wearing number 51; a woman asserts her data is solid and that it takes more than new paint, underscored by suspenseful music and a high-speed engine sound.\n\nExplanation: In event 9, the announcer explicitly announces that Lightning McQueen is driving the number 51 car. This confirms that the character is indeed racing in the Florida 500. The woman's assertion about the data and the suspenseful background music suggest that this moment is significant and builds anticipation for the race. However, it does not provide any direct information about how Lightning McQueen ended up wearing number 51 or how he got to the Florida 500. Options A, B, and D do not mention the specific number 51 car or confirm Lightning McQueen's participation in the race.",

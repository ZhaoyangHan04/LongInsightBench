    "model_answer": "The events that most directly led to the recommendation of inexpensive on-ear headphones were likely events 9 and 10, where the speaker discussed the importance of monitoring actor dialogue and being aware of one's surroundings on set. The use of noise-cancelling headphones could interfere with these important tasks, leading to a decrease in situational awareness. Therefore, option A and option B seem to be the most relevant events. Option C does not seem to be directly related to the topic of headphones, and option D mentions staying awake on night shifts, which is not necessarily related to the choice of headphones.",

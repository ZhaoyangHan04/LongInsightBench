    "model_answer": "The events that most directly prompted the expanded focus on connectivity and infrastructure were likely A: Event 5, where the host's question about challenges in attracting foreign investment and fostering competitiveness led the speaker to broaden her policy prescription, and C: Event 7, where the emphasis on investing in human capital and pushing the frontier in research and technology also influenced the speaker's perspective. Option B, about the need for ASEAN to push on competitiveness, and option D, about the impact of a US/Europe slowdown on Southeast Asia, may have also played a role, but they were not the primary prompt for the expanded focus on connectivity and infrastructure.",

    "model_answer": "The answer must relate to events leading up to the closing invitation. Events 12 and 14 seem most relevant as they involve discussions about Radha Govinda and the host's feelings about the program. Option A provides background on the location, which could be relevant. Option B involves a demonstration of the bhajan aspect, which may also be related. Option D does not appear to be directly connected to the closing invitation. Therefore, the answer is likely A: Event 12: The discussion reveals he is in Dallas under an affiliated center, giving a series of lectures on Sri Krishnaâ€™s leelas, and the host mentions Radha Govind Dham in Irving, TX., and C: Event 14: The host expresses happiness about having heard his bhajan, signaling a positive lead-in to promote attending such programs.",

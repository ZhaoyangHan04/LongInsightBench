These events provided specific examples and evidence that contradicted the idea that the procedure was scientific. The speaker explained that the absence of material evidence, the ignoring of obvious hypotheses, and the removal of evidence from the scene made it impossible to conduct a proper scientific investigation. Therefore, she concluded that the procedure was not a scientific procedure at all.",

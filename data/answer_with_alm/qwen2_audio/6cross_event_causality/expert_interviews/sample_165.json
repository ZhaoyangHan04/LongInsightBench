He contrasts the use of chemical vapor deposition on copper (event 12), which produces high-quality single-layer graphene, with natural graphite (event 13), which yields low-quality platelets. The speaker also mentions that impurities are removed during the process of making graphene (event 14), which further supports the idea that the production process plays a significant role in determining the quality of graphene.",

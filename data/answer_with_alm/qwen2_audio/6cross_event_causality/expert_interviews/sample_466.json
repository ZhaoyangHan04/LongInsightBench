    "model_answer": "The events that most directly enabled the successful frame to happen were:\n\nA) Event 7: Watching a Jacques Cousteau special about Andaman elephants swimming between islands, inspiring him to visualize and pursue a swimming-elephant photograph, shown while he stands beside the framed underwater elephant image.\nC) Event 10: Re-upping his contract and selecting an island with two elephants and steep bathymetry on one side, creating the conditions to attempt the shot.\n\nEvent 9 (reading the newspaper headline that the environment-and-forests chief minister was jailed, realizing his permission was off and the shoot was canceled) seems to have had no direct impact on the success of the frame. Event 8 (meeting with the editor of National Geographic magazine) is related but not central to the outcome. Event 11 (planning and executing the shoot logistics) was necessary but not sufficient by itself to ensure the success of the frame.",

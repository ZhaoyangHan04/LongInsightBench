    "model_answer": "The most plausible preceding sub-events that prompted the guest to present the two messages are:\n\nA: Event 5: The interviewer asks how to apply the information to science and what differences it can make.\nB: Event 4: The guest explores non-traditional factors (e.g., sinusitis, fallen arches) that individually seem unrelated but collectively form a powerful risk.\nC: Event 3: The guest discusses vascular risk factors and wonders whether the brainâ€™s fight-back/repair processes may cause harm.\n\nThese events likely led the guest to reflect on the broader implications of his research and the potential impact on public health and scientific understanding. The discussion of non-traditional risk factors in event 4 may have inspired him to consider how seemingly unrelated conditions could contribute to dementia risk. Meanwhile, events 5 and 3 may have highlighted the importance of applying scientific knowledge to real-world problems and the need for ongoing research into dementia and other age-related diseases.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible contributing factors to the animal researchers leaving the industry after the film's release are events B and C. Event B discusses the speaker's ethical stance on animal rights and disease, which could lead to controversy and backlash against animal researchers. Event C mentions the speaker's emphasis on using advanced technology to advance medical treatments without harming animals, which could also be seen as a criticism of animal research practices. Both of these events could have contributed to the decision of some animal researchers to leave the industry. Option A does not seem to be directly related to the event, and option D only mentions the speaker's argument about the morality of animal experimentation, which is not necessarily linked to the film's release.",

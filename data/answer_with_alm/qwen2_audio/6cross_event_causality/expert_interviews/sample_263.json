    "model_answer": "The events leading up to the concluding appeal in event 15 were primarily driven by events 13 and 14. In event 13, the interviewee laid out the stakes of truth-telling and its potential consequences for humanity and democracy, which formed the basis for their call to action in event 15. This was complemented by event 14, where the discussion about the lack of transparency in the Manning case and the subsequent crowdfunding effort to obtain a transcript highlighted the importance of access to information and the role of public scrutiny in holding those in power accountable. Together, these events set the stage for the intervieweeâ€™s appeal in event 15.",

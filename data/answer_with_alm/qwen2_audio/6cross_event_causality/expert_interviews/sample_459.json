This helps build trust between citizens and the government, leading to increased participation. Option C is also correct because listing the potential risks associated with AI can help citizens understand the importance of their participation in AI governance. Option D does not seem directly related to the high level of citizen participation in the Decidim Barcelona platform. Option B is partially correct because the emphasis on regaining citizens' trust is important for increasing participation, but it is not the only factor that contributed to the success of the platform.",

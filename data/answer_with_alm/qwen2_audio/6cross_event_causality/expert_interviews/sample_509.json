    "model_answer": "The requirement for a narrowband signal that repeats in event 10 makes sense because such signals are easier to filter out from other forms of noise and interference. This is consistent with event 8, which mentions the expectation of narrowband, drifting signals that are distinguishable from broadband astrophysical emissions. Additionally,窄带信号也更容易被监测和追踪，这与事件9中提到的问题有关，即人类制造的射频干扰（如手机、电视和卫星）会污染数据，因此需要有严格的筛选准则来排除这些干扰。窄带信号还有助于降低生产成本，并且具有大气传输的特点，这与事件7中的理由一致。因此，答案是：A/B/C/D",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible events leading to and motivating the anniversary-themed closing are A and C. The opening visuals in Event 0 clearly displayed the anniversary theme, setting the stage for the rest of the event. Additionally, the backdrop in Event 1 featured \"10th Year\" signage, which reinforced the anniversary context during the discussion. Option B is less likely because the statement about the forum reaching its tenth year was made during the interview, not before. Option D does not seem directly related to the anniversary theme.",

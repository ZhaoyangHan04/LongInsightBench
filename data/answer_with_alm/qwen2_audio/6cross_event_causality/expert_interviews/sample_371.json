This emphasizes the need for similar safety measures in workplaces, thereby setting up the argument that school environments should also be made as safe as possible.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: C: Event 11: Discussion of “half a million children infected,” under-testing in children, and ONS including mild/asymptomatic cases, with visuals like “NOT LIKELY TO GET TESTED!” and “Children are less likely to be symptomatic,” indicating the true burden could be higher.\n\nThe discussion in Event 11 highlights the fact that many children who are infected with COVID-19 may go undetected due to under-testing, which could significantly increase the actual number of infected children. This information is crucial in understanding the potential impact of long COVID on children, especially when considering the large number of children who could be affected. The use of visual aids such as graphs and diagrams also helps to emphasize the severity of the situation and the need for further research and action. Therefore, this event provides the necessary context and evidence to support the conclusion that millions of children could be affected by long COVID, leading to the shocked reaction from the male speaker.",

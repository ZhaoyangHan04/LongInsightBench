During event 1, the guest expresses fear and hesitation about the project, which suggests that there may have been concerns about the content or tone. This could have led to changes in the script, including the removal of the threesome scene. Later, during event 2, the guest discusses how Tyler helped her overcome her fears and embrace her sensuality, which could indicate that the decision to alter the scene was influenced by a desire to explore those themes more deeply. Additionally, the reference to the \"Ooh lord\" reaction during event 2 suggests that the original scene may have been quite intense or provocative.",

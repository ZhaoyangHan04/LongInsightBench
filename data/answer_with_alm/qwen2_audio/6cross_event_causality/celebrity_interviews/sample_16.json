    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on entertainment for help. After Tom's representative confirmed Tom's deep sadness, Katie's team secured Tom's departure from their hotel in Iceland where they were filming Top Gun: Maverick. This made way for her to be seen in the same restaurant with Tom less than a year ago, which seemed like a couple going well together. This led to the media reporting their romance, which eventually caused Tom and妮可基德曼's divorce.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Event 11: Tom is described as \"caught off guard,\" with a quote that he was \"deeply saddened,\" while another speaker praises Katie's moves as \"literally perfect,\" indicating a shift toward damage control rather than prolonged combat.\n\nThis event likely contributed to the de-escalation and rapid movement toward settlement because it showed a change in Tom's perspective and a willingness to consider his wife's actions as \"perfect.\" This shift in tone could have signaled to both parties that a resolution was possible and that further conflict was not desired. Additionally, the mention of Tom being \"caught off guard\" suggests that he may have been more open to compromise and finding a mutually beneficial solution.",

    "model_answer": "The events that most directly set up the deeper social-question about making morally conscious songs are:\n\nA) Event 0: The interviewer frames the interview around the new 'Love Yourself' era and the members explain that love is complex and includes parts people want to run away from. This sets the stage for a discussion about the meaning and impact of the band's music.\n\nB) Event 1: The discussion of pressure around the first song, the difficulty of individuality/performing alone, and a follow-up asking about the meanings of songs on the album. These discussions touch on the challenges and pressures faced by musicians, which can relate to the broader topic of creating music with a positive message.\n\nTherefore, the combination of these two events provides the necessary context for the interviewer to raise the question about the moral obligation of making socially conscious songs.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is likely B and C. The mention of a celebratory box of BTS-themed donuts suggests a moment of celebration or achievement, which could be linked to the release of their new album 'Love Yourself: Tear' and the excitement surrounding it. The reference to the BBMAs and the evolution of the group since 2013 also fits within the context of their recent activities and accomplishments. Additionally, the discussion about moral obligations and sending positive messages aligns with the values and goals that the group has expressed publicly.",

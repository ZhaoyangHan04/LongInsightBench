This indicates that the host is expecting more questions and has prepared for them by keeping the studio setup and cutaways available.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible option is C: Event 4: A response that parents were supportive of the music but mom was initially disappointed about tattoos, delivered in the studio while one member holds a card and gestures. This option fits the context because it mentions a specific moment where the speaker's mom expressed disapproval of tattoos, which later changed when the speaker's band gained success. The other events do not have as clear of a connection to the speaker's mom's reaction to tattoos.",

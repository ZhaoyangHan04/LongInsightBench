The screenshots of viral tweets in Event 2 highlight the issue of people making inappropriate comments about her appearance. Event 4 discusses her choice to wear baggy clothes to control her image, which ties into the broader conversation about how celebrities navigate their public personas. Event 5 delves into the legal implications of Billie's age and relationships with older men, which raises further concerns about objectification and exploitation. Finally, the host's own personal experiences and discussions about age and consent help to humanize the issue and make it more relatable to viewers.",

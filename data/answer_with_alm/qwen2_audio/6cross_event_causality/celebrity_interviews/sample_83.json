    "model_answer": "The most plausible moments leading up to the promotional wrap-up were likely B: Event 5, where the host praised the guest's verse in a song and joked about his construction job, highlighting him as an artist, and D: Event 9, where the guest lists concrete goals (100k followers/subs, an album) and prioritizes getting the best deal for himself. These events probably built interest and credibility for the guest among the audience, making them more receptive to hearing a call-to-action from him.",

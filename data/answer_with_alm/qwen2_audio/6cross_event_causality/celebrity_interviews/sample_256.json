    "model_answer": "Answer: A: E7: Aretha corrects the interviewer’s “R-E-S-P-E-C-T take out P-C-E” to “TCB—take care of business” (yellow jacket, floral backdrop, on-screen text), plus E8: the exchange “I was taking care of business”/“I’m glad I straightened it out” in the audience setting, plus E6: her self-summary across eras (“1967, young and sassy; 1994, sassy and classy”) with the Grammy backdrop.\nExplanation: The preceding events establish Aretha Franklin as a confident and sassy artist who is comfortable with her identity and history. The yellow jacket and floral backdrop suggest a celebratory and nostalgic atmosphere, which aligns with Aretha's self-descriptor as a \"lady who takes care of business.\" The exchange about \"taking care of business\" in the audience setting reinforces this image, while her self-summary across eras highlights her longevity and resilience. Together, these elements set the stage for Aretha's self-definition as the \"lady who takes care of business.\"",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible moment leading to Aretha's self-affirming answer is option A, which includes her denying any financial troubles and embracing her role as a diva. This sets a tone of confidence and pride, which aligns with her later statement about admiring herself. The other options do not seem directly related to her self-assuredness in this particular moment.",

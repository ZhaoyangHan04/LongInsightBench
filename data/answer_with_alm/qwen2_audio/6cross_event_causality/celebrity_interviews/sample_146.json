Option A is directly related to Cardi B's recent statement about stopping plastic surgery, as it references her previous breast augmentation surgery and liposuction. Option D also seems relevant as it discusses her swollen feet post-surgery, which could have been a contributing factor to her decision to avoid further procedures.",

Option C mentions that she recently had breast augmentation surgery, which could cause swelling. Option D also suggests that she underwent liposuction, another procedure that can lead to swelling. Events A and B do not seem directly related to her swollen feet.",

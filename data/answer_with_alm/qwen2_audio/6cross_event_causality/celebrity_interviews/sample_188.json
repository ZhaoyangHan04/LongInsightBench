    "model_answer": "The most plausible events leading up to the female interviewee's personal disclosure of being bullied in middle school are A: Event 9, where the interviewer asks about getting bullied and punching someone, and B: Event 0, where the host introduces the concept of kids asking questions, creating a comfortable and candid atmosphere. These events likely prompted the interviewee to reflect on her past experiences and feel comfortable sharing them with the audience.",

    "model_answer": "I would select option B because the dramatic voiceover sets up the context of discussing Disney's villains, which could lead into discussions about their actions and behaviors, including stealing. This could make the male interviewee more likely to reflect on his own past actions, such as taking a watch, in light of the villain theme.",

    "model_answer": "The preceding events that most likely contributed to transforming the home's original movie theater into an art studio are:\n\nA: Event 6 - The desire for a serene, relaxing home that contrasts with a chaotic travel schedule suggests that the owners may have wanted a private space for artistic pursuits, which could include turning the movie theater into an art studio.\nB: Event 9 - The preference for low-key hangouts in a formal living room with no TV, enjoying music and the fireplace with friends, implies that the owners may have wanted a space for creative activities and socializing that is different from a traditional entertainment room.\nC: Event 8 - The fact that the kitchen is the most used room for dinners with friends and is emphasized as such in the visuals suggests that the owners may have wanted a functional space that is also conducive to artistic activities.\nD: Event 4 - While the separate custom estate with a movie theater, pool, and lounge areas is certainly an impressive and luxurious space, it is less directly related to the transformation of the original movie theater into an art studio.\n\nTherefore, the combination of events A, B, C, and possibly D may have contributed to the decision to transform the home's original movie theater into an art studio.",

    "model_answer": "The events that most directly support the conclusion that Kendall and her boyfriend likely stay at Kendall's Mulholland Estates home rather than Devin's new place are:\nC: Event 6 (audio+visual): Kendall owns a serene Mulholland Estates Spanish-style mini-mansion in L.A., purchased in 2017 and tucked behind gates, with visuals of her established property and courtyard/patio areas. This provides evidence that Kendall has a comfortable and familiar residence in Los Angeles that she prefers over Devin's newer, possibly less established home in Phoenix.",

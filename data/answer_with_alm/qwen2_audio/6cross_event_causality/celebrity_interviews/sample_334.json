    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 6 — The host says he loves New Orleans and discusses foods like frog’s legs and alligator, deepening the New Orleans theme. This event sets the foundation for the New Orleans theme that continues throughout the show, making it more likely that the music sting from Event 8 would be relevant and fitting.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible moments leading up to the on-air playing of the mouth organ in Event 10 are:\n\nC: Early in Event 10 — The host talks about how difficult the accordion is, mentions a friend trying to teach him, then invites the guest to play and hands her a fresh mouth organ with instructions.\n\nThis is because the conversation about the accordion sets the stage for a musical segment, and the offer to play the mouth organ follows logically from there. Additionally, the fact that the host provides the guest with a new mouth organ to play suggests that they were expecting her to perform, which could only have been possible if they had discussed it beforehand.",

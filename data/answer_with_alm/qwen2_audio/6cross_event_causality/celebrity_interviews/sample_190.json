    "model_answer": "I would select events B and C as they directly build the self-deprecating tone that led to the big laugh. In event B, the playful and sharp exchange leads to teasing about appearance and personality, which sets a foundation for self-reflection and humor. In event C, the guest's mention of being roasted on Comedy Central and her animated delivery further emphasize her self-awareness and ability to take humor in stride. Both events showcase the guest's ability to connect with the audience and use humor to navigate difficult situations.",

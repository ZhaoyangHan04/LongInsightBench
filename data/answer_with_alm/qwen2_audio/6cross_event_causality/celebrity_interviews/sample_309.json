    "model_answer": "The answer must be chosen from events leading up to America's acceptance speech on stage. We know that America stood and headed towards the stage after the presenter introduced her, so option A must be correct. Additionally, the presenter praised America's achievements earlier in the evening, setting the stage for her award recognition, making option C also correct. Option D does not seem relevant as it's a humorous comment made by the opening emcee. Option B mentions America receiving the SeeHer Award, but we don't know if that was the direct cause of her acceptance speech on stage. Therefore, the answer is (A) and (C).",

Option D, where she thanked male collaborators, does not seem to be directly related to her message to kids with aspirations.",

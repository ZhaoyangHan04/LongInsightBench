    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Event 5: Completing a second cleanout with about 110 pieces and confirming continuation along the pay streak (close-up visuals of many particles in the green pan; audio counts pieces).\n\nThis event is directly related to finding gold, as it involves the prospector conducting another cleanout and confirming the presence of gold along the pay streak. The other events mentioned may have indirectly contributed to the final result, but they are not as directly linked to the achievement of the end-of-day total.",

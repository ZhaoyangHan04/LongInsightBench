    "model_answer": "The answer should be provided in JSON format. { \\\"Answer\\\": [\\\"Event 8\\\", \\\"Event 9\\\"] } Event 8 sets the scene for the Mail Call segment by suggesting a break after reaching the summit and possibly trying for another one. This event also involves hiking through the woods, which aligns with the visual content of the Mail Call segment. Event 9, where a flat tire occurs and the decision is made to switch to Mail Call, provides the immediate context for the change in content direction. The repair of the tire and the subsequent discussion about the Mail Call segment occur in real-time, making this event a key trigger for the change.",

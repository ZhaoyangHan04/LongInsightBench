    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Refining the line in edit mode and running an altitude lookup to fill gaps and improve measurements (event 5).\n\nExplanation: The 3D terrain visualization of the planned route appears after refining the line in edit mode and running an altitude lookup to fill gaps and improve measurements. This process likely created a more accurate representation of the intended ridge section, which was then included in the 3D view. Drawing a rough track and switching to a different map background may have been helpful, but they were not directly responsible for creating the 3D view with the intended ridge section. Adding an extra point on the ridge was also helpful, but it was not the primary action that led to the creation of the 3D view.",

    "model_answer": "The answer must include the steps taken in events 5 and 10. The export of the planned route as a GPX file was made possible by completing the track's metrics, which included an altitude lookup, in event 5. Additionally, event 10 involved adding the opencaching waypoint and ensuring the track was ready for export. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Using edit mode to add detail and then doing an altitude lookup to complete the track’s metrics and D: Adding the opencaching waypoint and confirming “the track is ready”.",

    "model_answer": "The preceding actions that most directly produced the material on the digital scale reading were likely A: Event 4 — In-stream dredging and panning with a sluice, as well as C: Event 7 — Backyard clean-up: stirring a full bucket and noting he’s starting to see “a little bit of color.” These events involve the handling and processing of gold flakes, which could have led to the material being weighed on the digital scale. The other events do not seem to be directly related to producing the gold flakes that ended up on the scale.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is B: Event 7 — On-screen text states “3 Days of actually dredging!” while he discusses tracking hours, gold per hour, and stirs a full bucket with visible color. This moment best explains why the narrator references three days and is concluding the session as it occurred during the third day of the dredging activity.",

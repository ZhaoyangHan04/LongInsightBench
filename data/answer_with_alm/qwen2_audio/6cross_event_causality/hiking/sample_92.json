    "model_answer": "The most plausible contributing factors to the speaker's state of exhaustion are events C and D. The fork in the trail provided a crucial decision point where the speaker had to choose between an easier and a more challenging route. This decision likely added mental stress and physical exertion to his journey. Additionally, the mid-ascent check-in, where he reveals his height and remaining distance, indicates that he was already significantly tired before reaching the summit. This information helps us understand why he felt 'knackered' and ready to turn back.",

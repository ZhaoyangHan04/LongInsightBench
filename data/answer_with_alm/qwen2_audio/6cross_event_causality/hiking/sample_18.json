    "model_answer": "The preceding event that most directly caused the sliding descent was probably option B: Straying from the trail and crunching through snow off-route. This is because the description mentions that the person was following footprints, not buttprints, which suggests they were off the designated path. Additionally, the sound of slipping in the snow implies that the surface was slippery, likely due to the snow. The other options do not seem to be directly related to the sliding descent.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A, B, C. The audio mentions seeing a fast-flowing stream earlier and on-screen text noting surrounding streams were at flood stage during spring runoff (event 3). This implies that there was more water flowing in the stream due to the melting of snow and rain during the spring. Additionally, warm conditions at the snowline—audio mentions it’s beautiful, warm, and refreshing—implying increased meltwater feeding streams (event 5). Later in the day, when it's getting late, as mentioned in the audio, can also lead to snow softer and runoff higher (event 6), making the stream more challenging to cross. Encountering a territorial goat near the summit area (event 10) does not directly contribute to the difficulty of crossing the stream.",

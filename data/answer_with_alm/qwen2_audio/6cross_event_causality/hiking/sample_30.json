    "model_answer": "The events that most directly led to the hiker using a snow probe to test the snow depth were:\n\nA) Event 1: The hikers remarking on the unexpectedly deep snow on Lusk Ridge and showing wet feet while pushing through the snowy forest likely indicated that the snow was deeper than they had anticipated. This could have prompted them to take precautions and use a snow probe to check the depth before proceeding.\nB) Event 2: The narrator's description of sinking up to the hips in deep snow and Rex putting on rain pants suggests that the snow was already deep and potentially hazardous. This could have also prompted the group to be cautious and consider using a snow probe.\nC) Event 3: While the helicopter passing overhead may have been interesting, it does not seem to have a direct impact on the decision to use a snow probe.\nD) Event 5: Repeated post-holing and crawling through soft snow likely made the group aware of the challenges they would face if they continued on foot without proper preparation. This could have led them to use a snow probe to check the stability and depth of the snow before proceeding.",

    "model_answer": "The prolonged duration of the hike was most likely caused by a combination of events: \nA) Discovering more snow than expected on Lusk Ridge led to wet feet and slower movement through the snowy forest, which added time to the hike.\nB) The difficult hour of hip-deep sinking required gear adjustments and extra effort, further adding to the time spent hiking.\nC) Frequent post-holing and sections where they had to crawl and move carefully through soft snow also contributed to the extended hike time.\nD) Taking a scenic rest stop below the last summit may have been enjoyable, but it did not significantly impact the overall duration of the hike.\n\nTherefore, the selected options are A, B, and C as they collectively explain the prolonged duration of the hike.",

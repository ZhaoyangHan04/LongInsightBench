    "model_answer": "The most directly enabling action for identifying the woman on the plate as Pauline Frederick in event 6 was probably option A: Event 5 sub-event: He says the object has writing on it that is backwards and suggests it’s a stamp印花/印刷 plate, right after digging it up. This indicates that the speaker noticed the reversed writing on the plate and made the connection to it being a printing plate, which led him to identify Pauline Frederick.",

This suggests that the speaker has been paying attention to the different types of signals and their corresponding targets, which has helped him successfully identify the location of the target in this case.",

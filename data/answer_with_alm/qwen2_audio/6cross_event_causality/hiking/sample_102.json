    "model_answer": "The events that most likely led to the hunter's discovery were A and B. The mention of finding coins and a hot spot suggests that he had already found something valuable, which encouraged him to continue searching. Additionally, his discovery of a gold ring in Event C also motivated him to keep digging. Event D does not seem to be directly related to the discovery of the toy car.",

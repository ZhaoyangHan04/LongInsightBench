    "model_answer": "The answer should include events that led him to be in the area where he found the cabin. Events 2 and 4 seem likely because they involved route choices that brought him closer to the area where he encountered the cabin. Event 7 may have also been relevant, as it could have put him on the path he took later. However, events 5 and 6 do not appear to be directly related to finding the cabin. Event 9 does not make sense in this context since it refers to checking with AllTrails after finding the cabin, not before. Therefore, the most plausible answer would be A and D.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible contributing factors to the deer being visible and relatively undisturbed at that moment are events B and C. Option B mentions the hiker entering a steeper, shaded area where the smells are much thicker, which could create a more natural habitat for deer. Option C suggests that the hiker has not seen anyone else on the trail that day, indicating that there is less human disturbance in the area. Combined, these events may have led to a decrease in the hiker's presence and a greater likelihood of encountering deer.",

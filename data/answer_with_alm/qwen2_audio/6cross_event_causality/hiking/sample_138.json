    "model_answer": "The narrator carries heavy loads because he needs to carry essential items for his journey, which includes food, water, and other supplies. He also carries specialized equipment for his work as a guide, such as maps, compasses, and first aid kits. The weight of this gear is managed by selecting appropriate gear and using techniques like distributive packing to distribute the weight evenly across his body. Additionally, he gradually builds up his strength and endurance through regular exercise and training, which allows him to carry the weight comfortably over long distances. (Option C) provides additional context on the narrator's approach to selecting gear and using it effectively. Option D discusses the benefits of using high-quality gear, but does not directly relate to the reasons for carrying heavy loads. Option A mentions the narrator's unique experience and the utility of his pack to others, but does not provide specific details on the reasons for carrying heavy loads.",

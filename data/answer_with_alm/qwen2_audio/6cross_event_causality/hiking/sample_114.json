    "model_answer": "The most plausible contributing factor to the time-pressure situation in event 3 is option C: Event 2: Time spent on ambiguous finds (shotgun shell, damaged object, unidentified “spear tip”), growing frustration, and even moving fields before resuming the search. This suggests that the speaker was already experiencing delays and frustration during their search, which likely led to the urgency to find something quickly before losing any more light.",

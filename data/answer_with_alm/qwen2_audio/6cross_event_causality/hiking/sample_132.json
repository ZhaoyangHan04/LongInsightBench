    "model_answer": "The preceding sub-events that most directly enabled the summit success were:\n\nA: Leaving the woods and getting onto a good path after an easy start (event 2).\nB: Choosing the third path at the split, heading toward the foot of Ben Allchin (event 4).\n\nThese two events set the stage for a successful hike by ensuring a clear route and avoiding potential difficulties. Event C, deciding on a big climb, was a crucial decision made after reaching the foot of the mountain, but it was not directly enabled by earlier events. Event D, taking a coffee break, was a brief pause during the hike and did not contribute significantly to the ultimate success.",

    "model_answer": "The most direct prior sub-events leading to the hiker's second summit were:\n\nA) Departing Sgurr Mòr to continue toward the next summit after celebrating the first Munro (event 8)\nB) Starting the descent toward the next Munro, realizing the long distance and steep re-ascent, then deciding to “get cracking” (event 10)\n\nThese two events set the stage for the subsequent climb up Sgurr na Gruagaich as the hiker was already in the area and had a clear goal in mind. Option C, completing a short but steep climb just before the top, seems like a separate event that did not contribute significantly to reaching the trig point of Tom na Gruagaich. Option D, first sight of Sgurr Mòr and commentary about being between Flowerdale and Shieldaig Forest, does not seem relevant to the events leading up to the second summit.",

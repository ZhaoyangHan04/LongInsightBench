    "model_answer": "The events that most plausibly contributed to the outcome of the dried-up stream bed are A: Event 2 and C: Event 8. The mention of being in an Area of Outstanding Beauty and wondering about imminent harvest time implies summer conditions, which can lead to a lack of flow in streams. Additionally, the visual of a dry-looking path and the presence of tall ferns, both mentioned in event 8, also suggest dry conditions. On the other hand, events 3 and D do not directly relate to the condition of the stream bed.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible choices leading to the narrator's decision to stay on the lower track are events B and C. Event B indicates that the narrator is already feeling fatigued from the climb, making it less likely she wants to continue uphill. Event C suggests that the narrator is considering the effort required to reach the summit and the quality of the view as factors in her decision-making. Together, these events imply that the narrator has become increasingly aware of the physical challenges and potential negative impacts of continuing the climb.",

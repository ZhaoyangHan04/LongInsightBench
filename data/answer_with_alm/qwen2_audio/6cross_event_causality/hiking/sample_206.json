    "model_answer": "The events that most directly contributed to the gold being weighed at exactly 2.00 grams were:\n\nA: Announcing and retrieving the first piece of gold while using the snuffer bottle and tools during the initial underwater sniping (event_id 1).\nB: Locating a pocket at the intersections of cracks and collecting about fifteen small pieces of gold while repeatedly \"just keep swimming\" (event_id 2).\n\nThese two events involved the direct use of tools and techniques related to gold panning and diving, which are essential for finding and weighing gold. The other events mentioned may have been helpful for planning and preparing for the dive, but they did not directly contribute to the final weight of the gold.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible answer is C: Slow, patience-heavy clay work and cleaning the area for more crevicing, alongside continued small finds (event_id 4). This activity requires physical exertion and patience, which could lead to fatigue after a few hours. Additionally, the mention of \"cleaning the area for more crevicing\" suggests that the work was meticulous and time-consuming, further contributing to fatigue. The other events do not seem directly related to fatigue from a few hours of activity.",

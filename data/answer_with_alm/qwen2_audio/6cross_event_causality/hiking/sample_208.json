    "model_answer": "The most direct preparation that enabled the rider to safely transport his bow and gear during the ride was option A: Event 3 – He reconfigured the ATV gun mounts (cutting the rubber handle) and uses bungees/rubber attachments to keep the bow from sliding so he can focus on handling the bike. This allowed him to maintain control of both the bike and the trailer while navigating the trail. The other events provided general guidance or practical demonstrations related to off-road biking and equipment, but they were not directly instrumental in enabling the safe transport of the bow and gear.",

    "model_answer": "The most directly relevant choice is C: Event 0 – He outlines using a mountain bike with a simple Schwinn cargo trailer to reach remote hunting spots and demonstrates attaching it. This choice sets up the idea that the rider is using a specialized vehicle to access remote areas, which is necessary for finding unpressured deer. The other choices do not specifically mention the use of a mountain bike or a cargo trailer for this purpose.",

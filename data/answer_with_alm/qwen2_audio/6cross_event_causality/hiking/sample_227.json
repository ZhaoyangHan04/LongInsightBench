    "model_answer": "The answer is: A: Event 7: The on-screen title “MISTAKE #6 DEHYDRATION” appears while the speakers introduce dehydration (with a disclaimer they’re not medical professionals).\n\nThis event likely led to a stronger emphasis on electrolytes' rehydration role because it directly addressed the topic of dehydration, which is a common issue during hiking. The subsequent discussion about the importance of electrolytes and providing samples to hikers also builds upon this initial emphasis.",

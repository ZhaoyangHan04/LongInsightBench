    "model_answer": "The events that most directly led to the result sub-event were (A) Event 7: The panner swirls back the black sands once, excitedly says he found “a lot of gold,” and points out particles in the pan., and (C) Event 8: After finding gold in the top mat, they clean the bottom mat; a small engine starts up and they say, “Gotta get this on camera.” These events demonstrate the process of gold panning, which involves separating gold from other materials using a pan and water. The excitement and discovery of gold in Event 7 likely motivated further cleaning and examination, leading to the final weighing of gold on a scale in Event 12.",

    "model_answer": "The likely answer is C: Event 8: A small engine starts while they clean the mats and continue running equipment to process material. This activity could have caused the gas-powered unit to stall as it may have been used to power equipment related to the processing of materials, and without sufficient fuel, it would have stopped operating.",

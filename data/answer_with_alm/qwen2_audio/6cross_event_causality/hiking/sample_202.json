    "model_answer": "The events that pushed the hiker to leave the Florida Trail and enter private land were A) being unable to continue due to the lack of wind and excessive heat, which caused his pace to slow significantly, and B) running low on water and needing to find alternative sources before reaching a ranger station. These events forced the hiker to deviate from the official trail and potentially entered private property. Option C does not seem to be a direct contributor to leaving the trail, and option D mentions tall grass but does not specify any action taken in response to it.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Event 7: He was almost out of water with no water for another 11 miles in very hot conditions, requiring an off-trail water detour (visual overlays list water logistics; audio emphasizes heat and water scarcity).\n\nThe events leading up to the need for outside assistance were his decision to head towards the road at around mile 5 after running out of water and being unable to find any on the trail, combined with the extremely hot conditions he faced. This eventually led him to call for help around mile 13.",

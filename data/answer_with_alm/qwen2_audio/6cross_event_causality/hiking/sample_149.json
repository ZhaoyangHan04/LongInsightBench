    "model_answer": "The events that most directly caused the transition onto the ridge were likely A: Event 2 and C: Event 4. The mention of the trail entering the forest and getting shorter as they climbed suggests physical effort and progression towards the ridge. The heavy breathing and description of a steep climb also indicate physical exertion, which aligns with the events leading up to reaching the ridge.",

    "question_id": "hiking_149_q2",
    "model_answer": "The most plausible prior sub-events that enabled the summit moment were A: Event 5 and C: Event 8. Option A is likely because the ridge trail and expansive views mentioned in event 5 suggest that the hiker was already at a high altitude, which would make reaching the summit easier. Option C is also likely because the audio indicates that the group was getting closer to the summit, and the description of someone holding a flag on a rocky outcrop matches the image of the hiker standing on the summit with a Canadian flag. The other events do not seem to be directly related to the summit moment.",

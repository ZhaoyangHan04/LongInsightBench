    "model_answer": "The most plausible contributing events to the result sub-event are A and C: Event 3 — He prepares camp and fishing kit, shows rods and a net, and heads to the lake to fish; and Event 7 — He tries again despite missed strikes, lands smaller fish, and keeps working the water. These events establish the setting and preparation for fishing, as well as the persistence and effort put into catching a fish. The mention of the B lure and the successful catch suggest that the techniques and equipment used were appropriate for the conditions encountered, but without additional context, it cannot be determined if this was due to prior events such as adjusting the fishing approach (Event 6) or finding a favorable location (Event 1).",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: After resting, he gathered enough firewood for the night to sustain a campfire. This prior sub-event made it possible for him to cook a steak and vegetables over the campfire. Option A does not mention gathering firewood, so it cannot be the correct answer. Option C mentions collecting firewood but does not specify how much was collected, so it is not sufficient to enable cooking. Option D mentions that the fire was already burning, but it does not mention whether enough firewood was gathered to sustain the fire for cooking purposes.",

    "model_answer": "The prior sub-events that most directly led to his decision to go back out and catch more fish were A: Catching fish earlier and B: His positive reflection on the fishing experience. These events likely motivated him to continue fishing and increase his success. Option C, finding firewood, does not seem directly related to his decision to fish more. Option D is also unrelated as it pertains to discovering old firewood.",

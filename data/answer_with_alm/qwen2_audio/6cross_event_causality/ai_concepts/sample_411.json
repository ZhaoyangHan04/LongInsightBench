    "model_answer": "The answer is C: The interview on the porch where the mom explicitly says she realized it was a robot texting her about $500, even though it came via Signal (event 11). This event provided crucial context for the mom's refusal to hand over the money, as it revealed her awareness of the previous interactions involving the AI and her suspicion that something was amiss.",

    "model_answer": "I would select A, B, and C as the events that most plausibly led to Chad's decision to not worry about his mom right before launching the test. The events involve Chad dealing with issues related to his mother, such as her constant texting and attempts to get him to leave home, which creates tension and stress. Additionally, the events involving the role-play prompt and the extended monologue further contribute to Chad's feelings of conflict and uncertainty, adding to the pressure to avoid worrying about his mother at this time. The later outdoor prep event does not seem directly related to Chad's decision-making process in this context.",

    "model_answer": "The most direct events leading to the rapid, large-scale training mentioned in event 9 were likely A and C. Option A mentions Isaac Gym as a tool that allows for quick iteration, which is necessary for training thousands of robots in minutes. Option C describes how the speaker found an implementation of theAMP method in Isaac Gym environments, which could potentially be used for large-scale training. Option D provides background on velocity-tracking rewards, but does not specifically mention the development of large-scale training methods.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Event 8. In Event 8, the speaker claims that software like Sora gives you an “entire studio at your whim,” democratizing text-to-video creation. This implies that Sora has the capability to generate a wide variety of videos, including those with high-quality visuals and professional-looking styles. This sets up the possibility that Sora-like models could be used for creating adult content, slander, and fraud, as mentioned in Event 12.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 13: Speculation about fully AI K-pop-style girl groups that can dance, interact with fans, and make music videos; visuals of an underwater city and battling pirate ships emphasize synthetic, controllable worlds.\nThis event discusses the potential for AI to create music videos and suggests that such videos would be produced by AI systems rather than human creators. This aligns with the idea that AI-generated content will become increasingly common in the future, as discussed in the conclusion of Event 14. Additionally, the use of visual examples such as underwater cities and pirate ships emphasizes the idea that AI can create synthetic, controllable environments, which fits with the description of evergreen, drama-free AI artists prioritized by record labels.",

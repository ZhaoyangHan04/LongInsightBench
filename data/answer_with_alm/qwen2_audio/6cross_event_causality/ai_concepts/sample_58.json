    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B/C. Event 3 explains that the model predicts the next word from sequences and has rapidly scaled parameters trained on huge amounts of data, which directly sets up the need for large datasets to support conversation pathways for more natural dialogue. Event 4 explains that parameters are co-occurrence vectors extracted from open-web training sets and are used to predict the next word, which also supports the need for large datasets. Option A discusses the goal of avoiding vanilla responses, but does not directly relate to the need for large datasets. Option D only mentions displaying safety and groundedness scores, which is a separate aspect of the model's performance, not its underlying mechanics.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on computer science for help. After the ImageNet competition in 2012, deep learning and computer vision made significant progress. New architectures were developed with better performance to solve the problem of image classification. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer since it describes the development of new architectures and their use in solving image classification problems.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible option leading to the final summary slide is B: Events 4-7. These events introduce and detail the concept of Multi-Task Neural Networks (MRNs) which seems to be directly related to the conclusion drawn in the final summary slide regarding mitigating data scarcity. Additionally, the explanation of MRNs in detail aligns with the need for a solution to handle data scarcity as stated in the problem framing earlier in the presentation.",

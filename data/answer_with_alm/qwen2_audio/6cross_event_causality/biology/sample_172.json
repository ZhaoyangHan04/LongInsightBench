    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. Letâ€™s solve this step by step. We know that in genetics, Punnett squares are used to show the probability of each possible combination of genotypes from two parents. In this case, the Punnett square is used to illustrate the inheritance of a dominant trait. Therefore, we need to look at the events leading up to this point. \n\nEvent 5 provides the foundational knowledge about genetics, including dominant and recessive traits and autosomal inheritance. This lays the groundwork for understanding Punnett squares and their application. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B: Event 5.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Event 8. This event introduces the concept of Punnett squares and how they are used to visualize and understand genetic inheritance. It also explains how X-linked recessive conditions work, where males can only inherit one X chromosome from their mother, which increases the likelihood of inheriting certain traits. This foundational knowledge laid in Event 8 sets the stage for understanding the high percentage likelihood of an X-linked recessive inheritance scenario displayed in Event 9.",

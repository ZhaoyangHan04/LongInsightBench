This mechanism involves site-specific DNA inversion mediated by the Hin recombinase, flipping promoter orientation to switch expression of flagellin genes. This allows Salmonella to alternate between different flagellin types, which is essential for its ability to evade the host immune response and persist in the host. The切换 of flagellin expression through phase variation is a key mechanism by which Salmonella survives and multiplies within the host.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on medical genetics for help. In Salmonella, phase variation is a mechanism that allows bacteria to evade the host immune system by switching between different flagellin subunit expressions (FliC and FliB). This process is controlled by the fliC gene, which has two promoters P1 and P2. When P1 is active, the bacteria express FliC, whereas when P2 is active, they express FliB. The change in expression is thought to be caused by a mutation in the fliC gene that activates or silences one of the promoters. Therefore, the preceding event that most directly causes the observed outcome is Event 7: Slide and narration describing that Salmonella alternates expression of FliC and FliB, and that their surface-exposed regions differ antigenically.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 4: Activated rhodopsin activates phosphodiesterase, converting cGMP to GMP and reducing cGMP available to keep cyclic nucleotide-gated Na+ channels open.\n\nPhotoreceptor cells in the retina contain a protein called rhodopsin that becomes activated by light. When light strikes the photoreceptors, a molecule called All-trans-Rhodopsin is formed, which triggers a cascade of events leading to the opening of ion channels. This causes an increase in the concentration of sodium ions (Na+) in the cell, which hyperpolarizes the cell membrane and reduces the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate. The closing of these ion channels also leads to a decrease in the concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which acts as a second messenger to regulate the activity of voltage-gated ion channels.\n\nTherefore, the direct cause of the decreased neurotransmitter release in response to light is the activation of phosphodiesterase by activated rhodopsin, which converts cGMP to GMP, reducing the amount of cGMP available to activate cyclic nucleotide-gated Na+ channels.",

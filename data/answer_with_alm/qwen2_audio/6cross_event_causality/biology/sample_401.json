This event sets up the context for the user to understand how the flashcards work and what to expect when they are revealed. It also lays the foundation for the Linnaeus reveal by demonstrating the type of scientific content that will be presented.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: Event 8 (earlier in the same event). \n\nEvent 8 is where the user is prompted to select the circulatory system from a list of body systems. This is likely to be related to the previous events where the topic of the human body systems has been covered, including event 3 where the 12 body systems are introduced, and event 9 where the user learns about genetically modified organisms. Therefore, events 3, 9, and possibly 11 may have indirectly contributed to the knowledge needed to identify the circulatory system as the answer to the final question in event 8.",

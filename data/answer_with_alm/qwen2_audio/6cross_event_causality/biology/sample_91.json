    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Events 8 + 7 + 6: Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells reduces insulin (Event 8), impairing insulin signaling and elevating blood glucose (Event 7); without insulinâ€™s lowering actions shown earlier (Event 6), glucose remains high, leading to polyuria and subsequent dehydration described in Event 10. \n\nIn Type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This leads to a lack of insulin production, which impairs the body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels. As a result, glucose builds up in the bloodstream, causing frequent urination (polyuria) to try and eliminate excess sugar. Without sufficient insulin, the kidneys cannot effectively remove water from the body, leading to dehydration.",

    "model_answer": "The following chains most plausibly contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and impaired wound healing due to damaged blood vessels and a suppressed immune system: A: Events 7 + 13 + 14; B: Events 12 + 13 + 14; C: Events 3 + 4 + 1; D: Events 5 + 6 + 9. \n\nAnswer: A, B, C, D\nExplanation: The events listed above each contribute to the development of diabetes and its complications, which are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease and impaired wound healing. For example, events 7, 12, 13, and 14 are related to insulin resistance and high blood sugar levels, which can damage blood vessels and lead to diabetes-related complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease. Events 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, and 9 also play important roles in the development of diabetes and its complications by affecting glucose regulation, hormone secretion, and other physiological processes.",

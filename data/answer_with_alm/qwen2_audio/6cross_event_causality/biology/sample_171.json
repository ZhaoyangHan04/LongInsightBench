    "model_answer": "The most plausible prior sub-events causing this specific-examples segment are:\n\nA) Event 5: Triglyceride dehydration synthesis example, with the on-screen model and narration that an enzyme removes atoms from the glycerol hydroxyl group during formation. This provides a concrete example of a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme and helps establish the concept of enzymes as catalysts.\n\nB) Event 7: Hydrolysis definition on-screen with narration that a different enzyme is used for “water cutting,” highlighting breakdown with a distinct catalyst. This reinforces the idea that enzymes are specific to certain chemical reactions and helps establish the concept of enzymes as catalysts.\n\nC) Event 9: Green overlay stating enzymes are protein catalysts required for most reactions, with narration that each reaction requires a distinct enzyme. This reinforces the idea that enzymes are essential for biological processes and helps establish the broad role of enzymes in chemistry.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, B, and C.",

    "model_answer": "The preceding sub-event that most directly enabled the bands to become visible on the membrane was option A: running the turtle blood proteins through SDS-PAGE to separate them into bands (event 5: Western Blot step 1). This step in the process created a protein ladder that allowed scientists to compare the relative amounts of different proteins in the sample.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Identifying AMH as a male-associated marker and showing an AMH band on a Western blot (event 3: AMH 60 kDa vs actin 42 kDa). This event was crucial as it established that AMH could be used as a male marker, which allowed scientists to determine the sex of baby turtles non-invasively.",

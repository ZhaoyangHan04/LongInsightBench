    "model_answer": "The events that most directly enabled the capability to control harmful bacteria and use beneficial ones are:\n\nA) Event 3: Leeuwenhoek first observes bacteria through a microscope and documents them, establishing their existence.\nC) Event 5: Koch advances germ theory and methods for growing bacteria on nutrient materials, enabling systematic study and control.\n\nOption B is also important because it establishes causal mechanisms to target bacteria, but it is not as directly related to the ability to control harmful bacteria and use beneficial ones. Option D provides additional knowledge about bacterial motility patterns but does not contribute to controlling harmful bacteria and using beneficial ones.",

    "model_answer": "The optimal temperature range for bacterial growth is often between 30-37Â°C, as mentioned in event 13 of the audio. This temperature range is important because it supports the metabolic processes necessary for bacterial growth, such as cell division and chemical transformations. \n\nOption A is correct because event 12 describes how bacteria reproduce quickly under ideal conditions, which includes maintaining optimal temperature. Option B is also correct because event 7 discusses the classification of bacteria based on their feeding habits, which highlights the importance of controlling environmental factors like temperature to support specific types of bacteria. Option C is partially correct because event 10 mentions that bacteria require nutrients and carry out chemical transformations, but it does not specifically mention temperature. Option D is incorrect because event 14 only mentions that some bacteria can form spores to survive extreme temperatures, not that the optimal temperature range for growth is necessarily within those temperatures.",

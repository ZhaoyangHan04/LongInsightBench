    "model_answer": "The most likely answer is C: Event 7: The initial hammerhead slides where visuals introduce HHRZ structure and the narration explains their function, occurrence in viroids, and autocatalytic cleavage. This event likely sparked interest in the topic of ribozymes and their mechanisms, leading to a deeper dive into hammerhead ribozymes and their specific properties and functions.",

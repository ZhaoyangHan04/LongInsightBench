    "model_answer": "B: Designing and presenting the miniaturized nanofiltration wearable device and planning animal model testing at UCLA with 65-kg pigs (event 9: slide visuals and audio detailing the device and animal model testing) most likely enabled the outcome reported in event 12. This is because the development and testing of the device were necessary to confirm its effectiveness in removing fluids and toxins from a living organism, which was achieved through the use of the miniaturized nanofiltration wearable device and the pig animal model. The other events provided context and support for the research, but they were not directly responsible for the confirmation of blood flow and filtration in the Qidni device.",

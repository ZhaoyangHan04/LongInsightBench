    "model_answer": "A: Event 1: The Vitamin A segment that visually shows carrots, leafy greens, and milk under “Vitamin A,” lists “Pro Vitamin A” and “Beta Carotene,” and the narration mentions sources like green leafy vegetables and milk.\nB: Event 2: The Vitamin D segment that visually brands D as the “Sunshine Vitamin” with a sun icon, while the narration explains UV-driven production and its absence in vegetables.\nD: Event 5: The Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin) slide that visually notes it is found in rainwater and, in narration, is a cobalt-containing vitamin important for RBC/DNA—another example of pairing vitamins with source/role descriptors.\n\nThe Vitamin C slide appears to be a summary of the preceding events, focusing on the vitamin's role as a \"Fresh food vitamin\" and \"Anti cancer vitamin.\" It likely builds upon the information presented in Events 1, 2, and 5, which focused on vitamins A, D, and B12 respectively, and their sources and functions. Therefore, the correct answer would be all three options: A, B, and D.",

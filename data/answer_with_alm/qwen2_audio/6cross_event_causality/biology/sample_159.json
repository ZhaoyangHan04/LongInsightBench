    "model_answer": "The answer is C: (event 11) Preparing culture plates by spreading 2.5 ml of pollen suspension in a 5 cm Petri dish and noting that pollen are best grown in liquid medium (with the diagram labeling pipetting and plating), prior to incubation. This step is crucial as it sets up the initial conditions for pollen growth and development, which leads to the observation of young embryoids after about 30 days of incubation.",

Additionally, the mention of slime molds behaving like fungi but not being fungi helps to clarify their classification within the protist kingdom.",

    "model_answer": "The key difference between slime molds and fungi is that fungi have chitin in their cell walls, which these protists lack. This fact was highlighted during Event 3 when slime molds were described as resembling fungi but not being true fungi. Therefore, the answer is C: Event 3's depiction of “Slime Molds” with the notes “behaves like fungi” and “not fungi,” alongside images of slime molds.",

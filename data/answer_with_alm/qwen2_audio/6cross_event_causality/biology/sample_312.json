    "model_answer": "The most direct cause of adults of S. pearsi being shown inside a fish intestine feeding on blood would be option C: L1s developing to L2 and L3 inside a copepod and then being transferred to the fish when the copepod is eaten. This is because the development of L2 and L3 stages within a copepod provides a natural environment for the nematode's growth and development, eventually leading to their transfer to a fish host. The other events listed may have contributed indirectly to the final outcome, but they are not the direct cause.",

    "model_answer": "The preceding anatomical sub-events that most directly enabled the female nematode to carry developing young inside her are:\n\nA: Male copulatory spicules used to transfer sperm to females (event 2: male morphology shown while audio explains spiculesâ€™ role)\nB: Female has a separate gonophore opening for sperm entry, distinct from the anus (event 3: female views with audio identifying the gonophore)\n\nThese events provided the necessary biology for reproduction in nematodes, allowing fertilization to occur and development of offspring within the female's body.",

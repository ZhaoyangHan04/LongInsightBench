    "model_answer": "The events that most directly contributed to the narrator's decision to leave the store were:\n\nB: Event 6: He remarks he’s sweaty and describes this as the busiest store, reinforcing his physical discomfort amid the crowd.\nC: Event 3: When checking the Wacky Mole, he hears it talk but sees it not moving, revealing earlier frustrations with malfunctioning props.\n\nThese events reflect the narrator's increasing frustration and discomfort in the crowded and possibly chaotic store environment, leading him to decide to leave. Option A only mentions the crowd, which is a contributing factor but not the main one. Option D refers to events that occurred later in the day, after the narrator had already decided to leave.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible events leading to the narrator's testing and judging of shelf items' functionality are A: At the Wacky Mole display, he hears the prop speak but sees it not moving, prompting concern about malfunctioning animatronics; B: Event 5: He notices Night Stalker is 25% off and says he’d bet something about it doesn't work, setting an expectation that some items might be faulty; and C: Event 8: A child presses an animatronic button and the narrator continues inspecting clowns and other figures up close, encouraging hands-on testing of features. These events suggest that the narrator has developed an interest in testing the functionality of various props, especially those involving movement or sound, which seems to have carried over into his evaluation of the shelf items. Option D does not seem relevant to this context.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Event 8: They buy fast passes at Universal and start entering houses faster, identifying specific houses and ramping up the pace. This event likely allowed them to complete more houses, which contributed to their high house count. Additionally, it suggests that they were strategic and efficient in their approach to the haunted houses, which could have helped them avoid getting stuck in lines or spending too much time in less interesting houses.",

Additionally, event 0 highlights the role of the community in supporting the hospital through donations and educational programs, which could indirectly contribute to the success of the SCBU by providing necessary resources.

    "model_answer": "The events that most directly led to the empowerment and skills outcome were:\n\nA: Event 5: On-the-job upskillingâ€”workers receiving training through classes and even educational YouTube videos on the construction site.\nB: Event 2: Hands-on workshop activity at the site, with women in safety vests/helmets engaged in discussions about project progress, reflecting practical application and learning on the job.\n\nThese events provided opportunities for women to gain practical skills and knowledge through hands-on experience, which contributed to their empowerment and confidence as construction workers. Option D, while related to healthcare, does not seem to be directly linked to the empowerment of women in construction. Option C is also less relevant, as it only mentions women discussing project progress, without any specific mention of skill-building or training.",

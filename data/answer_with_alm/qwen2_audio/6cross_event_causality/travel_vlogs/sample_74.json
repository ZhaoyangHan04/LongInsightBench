    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 8: Intentionally targeting bedrock exposures and cracks where gold gets stuck, then confirming they found exactly such a spot. This is because in Event 8, the prospector intentionally looks for areas where gold is likely to be found, and then confirms their assumption by finding gold in bedrock crevices.

    "model_answer": "The direct cause of choosing the touristy restaurant was likely option D: noticing a very long limousine nearby, as mentioned in the audio description. However, option B (seeing a restaurant with its shutter down) could also have contributed to her decision, as it suggests limited dining options in the area. Option C (catcalling and safety concerns at night) may have influenced her preference for a safer, more crowded environment, but it is not a direct cause of her choice of restaurant. Option A (her hunger) is an underlying reason for seeking food, but it does not specifically relate to the choice of restaurant location.",

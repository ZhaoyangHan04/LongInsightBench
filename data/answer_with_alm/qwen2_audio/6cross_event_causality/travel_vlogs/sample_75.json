    "model_answer": "The preceding steps that most directly enabled her to place rolled, air-compressed clothing bags into the suitcase were:\n\nA: Event 2 — She introduces and demonstrates the roll-up, no-vacuum compression bags, explaining you roll them to push air out. This helped her understand how to compress her clothes effectively.\nC: Event 7 — She inventories the clothes (dresses, shorts, shirts, bikini, cover-up) and says she’ll start layering items into bags before putting them in the suitcase. This step allowed her to plan how to pack her clothes efficiently and maximize space.\nD: Event 4 — She advises wearing the bulkiest shoes and stuffing socks/underwear/jewelry into shoes to save space. While this advice may have been helpful in general, it is not specifically mentioned as the direct cause of placing compressed clothing bags into the suitcase.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: B: Event 5: During the reveal, he confirms theyâ€™ll be in Jamaica for her birthday and details the suite and ocean view (audio); she says it will be her first time leaving the country and becomes emotional (visual/audio).\n\nThe conversation about the vacation being a surprise for her birthday likely made her feel excited and happy, but also possibly anxious about stepping out of her comfort zone by leaving the country for the first time. The revelation of the trip being in Jamaica, combined with the beautiful visuals and emotional response from her, could have contributed to her fear of flying.",

    "model_answer": "The most direct cause of the man in a red polo wearing a circular “KA ♥ THE DAWGS” sticker-button on his shirt was likely option B: Event 1 where she explained the UGA game-day tradition of making/handing out “Katie loves the dogs” buttons/stickers to friends and family and showed the sticker pack on camera. This implies that she either made the stickers herself or acquired them through this tradition, and then decided to wear one during the game day.",

    "model_answer": "The most direct sequence leading to the group being in the stadium for the \"4TH QUARTER TRADITION\" was option B: Events 7, 8, and 9 where they entered through Gate 2, appreciated their seats, took part in pregame traditions like pom poms and the marching band, remained engaged through the buildup, and eventually heard that Kentucky was mentioned (audio). This sequence likely kept them interested and invested in the game until the final quarter, when the score was tied 25-25, leading them to stay in the stadium for the tradition.",

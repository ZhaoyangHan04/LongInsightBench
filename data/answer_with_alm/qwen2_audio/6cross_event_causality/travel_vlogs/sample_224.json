    "model_answer": "The answer is B: Event 8 (visual+audio). In this event, Nate surveys the Halloween Factory area and mentions that there are no animatronics out, which implies that he has already seen some animatronics that were not damaged or malfunctioning. This suggests that he has knowledge of animatronics being sold at reduced prices during the clearance sales, such as the Night Crawler he found later. Additionally, his comment about spooky fixtures being for sale at the end of the season further supports the idea that he is familiar with the concept of clearance sales and their purpose.",

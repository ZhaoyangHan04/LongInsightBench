    "model_answer": "The most plausible causes of the transition from bikeway riding to navigating city streets are A: Event 8 and C: Event 1. Option A mentions that the beautiful bikeway is gone now, suggesting that they have left the protected path, which could be the reason for navigating city streets. Option C mentions that they decide to attempt the donut run by bike to Denver and describe the Boulder-to-Denver bike path, which sets up the approach into the city, providing context for why they would be in Denver city streets. Options B and D do not seem directly related to the transition from bikeway riding to navigating city streets.",

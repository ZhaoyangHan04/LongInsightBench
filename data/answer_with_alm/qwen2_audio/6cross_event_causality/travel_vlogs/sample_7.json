    "model_answer": "The events that most directly set up the final subscribe-and-departure moment are A: Event 0, B: Event 11, and C: Event 7. \n\nEvent 0 introduces the concept of subscribing and the idea of visiting Party City. This lays the groundwork for the final moment when the subscribe button appears and the speaker departs.\n\nEvent 11 also sets the stage by indicating that the speaker has completed his tour of Party City and is now ready to move on to the next destination.\n\nEvent 7, where the speaker becomes excited about using paper lanterns with bats for a party, adds a personal touch that makes the moment feel more relatable and exciting for the viewer. It also reinforces the theme of celebrating and having fun, which aligns with the overall tone of the video.",

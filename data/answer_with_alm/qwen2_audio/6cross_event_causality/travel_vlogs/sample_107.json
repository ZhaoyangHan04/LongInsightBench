    "model_answer": "The events that led to the couple's decision to file a police report were:\n\nA) Viewers' strong feedback after their widely-watched theft video, telling them they messed up by not filing a police report (event 1)\nC) The audience highlighting three key reasons to file: bike registry/possible recovery, exposing theft rings, and making local theft statistics public (event 5)\n\nThese events made the couple realize the severity of the situation and the importance of taking action, leading them to file a police report. Option B is incorrect because the couple initially believed they did not need a police report. Option D is partially correct as the police did advise them to file a report for insurance purposes, but it was the combination of viewer feedback and the audience's suggestions that ultimately influenced their decision.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible contributing factors to the man proposing car museum walkthroughs and asking viewers to comment are events B and C. The man's love for RV life and desire to pursue hands-on car work align with his interest in car museums. Additionally, his growing appreciation for community interactions and joy in meeting people on the road likely led him to consider inviting viewers to share their thoughts through comments. Option A does not seem directly related to the topic of car museums, while option D mentions a positive interaction with law enforcement but is not central to the discussion of the man's ideas for the YouTube channel.",

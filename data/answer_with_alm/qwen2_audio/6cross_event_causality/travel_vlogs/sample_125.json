    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are B and C. Events 2 and 4 directly set up and cause the outcome of the dog being walked along the city sidewalk using an improvised cord as a leash. In event 2, the small dog is already present in the car and ready to go, which is indicated by the speaker's playful interaction with it. In event 4, the speaker mentions forgetting a leash and improvising one with a cord, which is later shown attaching to the dog's neck area before they walk it. Option A does not seem to be directly related to the events leading up to the use of an improvised leash. Option D only mentions the driver's thoughts about camera equipment and does not provide any context regarding the dog or the leash.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible answer is C: Event 6 (earlier sub-event). In this event, the speaker is inside the camera shop examining gear, including DSLRs. Although he finds some equipment interesting, such as a tripod and a Rebel T6, it's not what he is looking for. This event sets the context for his desire to purchase a DSLR and eventually buys one online.",

All of these events contribute to making tomorrow quite packed:\n\n- Event 9: Exploring the city on the first day may lead to a full schedule, leaving little time for vlogging.\n- Event 11: Spending time with friends and showing off an apartment view on the first day could also fill up the schedule.\n- Event 3: Mentioning his two best friends by name suggests socializing and spending time with loved ones.\n- Event 6: Visiting popular tourist attractions like the Eiffel Tower or Louvre Museum can make for busy days.\n\nTherefore, all four events have some role in creating a packed schedule for the next day.",

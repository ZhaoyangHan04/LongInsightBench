    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Carrying out general boat prep and systems checks earlier, including putting the dinghy up, operating the winch, and confirming the battery switch status (event 6).\n\nExplanation: The phrase \"Okay, we’re ready to go for tomorrow,\" suggests that the sailboat is prepared and ready for departure. The events leading up to this statement likely involve preparing the boat for sailing, which includes tasks such as checking the systems, ensuring everything is functioning properly, and making any necessary adjustments. Option A mentions raising the sail at night, but this does not necessarily imply readiness for departure. Option C involves rigging the sail, which is related to preparing the boat, but it does not encompass all the necessary preparations. Option D has no relation to the preparation of the sailboat for sailing. Option B, on the other hand, covers several important aspects of preparing the boat for sailing, making it the most likely answer.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible factors leading to the group being buried up to their necks in the sand are A and D: The speaker's explicit decision to dig a big hole out of boredom because the weather turned cloudy (event 5) and spending time exploring a remote, rocky stretch of the island with odd debris and noting there were no boats around, suggesting limited distractions (event 4). While the earlier admiration of the beach’s super-fine sand and clear water, with close-ups of sand showing it was ideal for digging (event 1), and encountering docile lemon sharks and then moving to a new spot (event 3) could have contributed to the situation, they are less directly related to being buried in the sand.",

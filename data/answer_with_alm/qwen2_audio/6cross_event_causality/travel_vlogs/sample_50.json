This event directly enables the presenter to quickly set up and use the DJIOM 4, which allows for faster shooting. The other events may have indirectly contributed to the presenter's ability to shoot quickly, but they are not as directly related.",

This early event sets the stage for the presenter's emphasis on simplicity and portability in smartphone filmmaking, which is later reinforced through events like Event 10 where he showcases the FiLMiC Pro app and manual controls.

    "model_answer": "The most plausible option is A: His early promise to share practical travel/safety tips (event 0), his later recommendation to book tours in Rio (event 9), and his firsthand experience of hiring a guide for a favela visit (event 3). These events suggest that the speaker had already been thinking about travel in Brazil and had gained valuable insights into the country's culture and safety. This context makes it more likely that he would have had a personal experience with hiring a guide, which led him to share the cost example in event 10.",

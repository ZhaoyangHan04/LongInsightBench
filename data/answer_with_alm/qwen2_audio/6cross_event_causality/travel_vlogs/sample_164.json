    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are B/C. \n\nEvent 9 occurred when there were no taxis available, so they arranged for their cousin’s husband to drive them through the snow to the airport. This directly led to them arriving at the airport. \n\nEvent 10 describes the journey from the airport terminal to the Burger King, which was taken after clearing security and receiving the good news about their flight being on time. This event did not contribute to the family ending up at the airport Burger King as a result of any prior events. \n\nOption A does not mention the airport or the family leaving for the airport; instead, it refers to an update regarding the family’s flight status. Option D does not mention the airport or the family leaving for the airport either; it only references the family’s preparation for a cancelled flight due to the cold.",

This event represents the final step in the vlogger's trip to Ireland, as it details her arrival at her house and reunion with loved ones. The other events describe earlier parts of her journey, such as leaving home, traveling to Ireland, and experiencing a snowstorm, but they do not directly relate to her returning home.",

Option A, issues checking in their dog, seems like a possible indirect cause, as it could have contributed to the delay. Options C and D do not seem directly related to the missed flight.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Saying it was the busiest day, mentioning a morning flight and a Phoenix layover, calling the vlog a \"total flop,\" and debating whether to end it (event 8, audio/visual with luggage visible). This sub-event indicates that the vlogger was considering ending the vlog due to dissatisfaction or poor reception, which eventually led to her signing off as planned.",

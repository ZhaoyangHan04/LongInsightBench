    "model_answer": "The most plausible prior sub-events leading to the stop at the large stone lion are A: Event 13: They first pass the park with the stone lion visible while the narrator calls it the perfect place to visit, priming them to approach the statue, and C: Event 4: The narrator says they’re going for a walk to see the city and its Swiss-like houses, as we see her out on the street starting the walk. These events suggest that the family was already exploring the city and looking for interesting sights, which led them to notice the stone lion and decide to stop there. Option B does not seem to be directly related to the stop at the stone lion, and Option D only mentions the GPS showing the route but does not provide any context for the family’s decision to stop at the lion.",

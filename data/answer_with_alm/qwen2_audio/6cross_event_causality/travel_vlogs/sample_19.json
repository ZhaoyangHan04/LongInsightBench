    "model_answer": "The most plausible options leading to the “Davido” interview are C: Event 3 and D: Event 0. Both events use similar visual elements such as flames, flags, and a Ghanaian flag corner, which establishes a thematic connection. Additionally, C event highlights the difference in security between Nigeria and Ghana, which could be relevant to the subsequent discussion about Ghana being a better place to live compared to Nigeria. Therefore, these two events are most likely connected to the introduction of the “Davido” interview segment.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 3: The dark-blue-polo speaker, under the “the different between Nigeria and Ghana” title and flags, explicitly contrasts security, citing Boko Haram and kidnappings in Nigeria and saying Ghana is more peaceful. This event directly feeds into the concluding judgment about Ghana having better security than Nigeria.",

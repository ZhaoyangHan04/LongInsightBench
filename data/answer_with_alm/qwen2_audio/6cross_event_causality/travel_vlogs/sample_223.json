    "model_answer": "The most plausible causes of the man heading to a local donut shop for coffee on event 3 are:\n\nA: Moving day in North Carolina as the home is emptied and people depart (event 1), indicating belongings like the coffee maker have been packed away.\nB: Early morning realization that his coffee maker is already in New York City and he still needs hot coffee (event 2).\n\nThese two events directly relate to the man's need for coffee and the absence of his usual coffee maker. Option C (arrival in New York City and a trip to Bloomingdale's for a Father's Day gift) does not seem to be a likely cause, as it is unrelated to the man's immediate need for coffee. Option D (pouring wine and preparing a barbecue with friends in Queens) also does not make sense in this context.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible preceding sub-events leading to the curbside pickup are A: While exploring the city, deciding to get a Father’s Day gift from Bloomingdale’s (event 5) and C: Going to a North Carolina donut shop early in the morning for coffee because the coffee maker was already in NYC (events 2–3). These events suggest that the speaker had made plans to purchase a gift for their father and needed coffee, which led them to seek out a place to pick up items. The other options do not seem to be directly related to the need for curbside pickup.",

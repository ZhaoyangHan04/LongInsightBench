    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 7: Using the cameraâ€™s AI to auto-pick interesting ride moments and allowing the user to select and export highlights straight from the camera. This event sets up the capability to automatically select interesting moments during a ride, which is necessary for the in-app highlight editing and motion blur simulation options shown in event 8. The other events are related to setting up the recording setup or capturing high-quality footage, but they do not directly set up the in-app highlight editing feature.",

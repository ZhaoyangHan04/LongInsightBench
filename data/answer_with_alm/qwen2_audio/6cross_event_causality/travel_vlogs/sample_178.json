The early Passport Kings branding and website visuals in Event 0 set expectations for later calls to action, which were reinforced by the on-screen “Passport Kings” like-and-subscribe graphic during the Nigeria segment in Event 5. Additionally, the travel-hacking promo with on-screen messaging in Event 6 directly preceded and modeled the final CTA style, which was the final call to action in Event 12. The Angola country segment in Event 7 did not include a CTA focus.",

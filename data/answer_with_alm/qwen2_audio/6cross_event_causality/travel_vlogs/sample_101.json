This moment sets up the final call-to-action by signaling the end of the video and encouraging viewers to subscribe to the Ohana Adventures channel. The mention of the video being linked in the bathroom tour (option A) and the cross-promotion during the desk segment (option B) also help establish setup, but they don’t directly lead into the final call-to-action. The discussion about bed linens and blankets (option D) does not seem relevant to setting up the conclusion of the video.",

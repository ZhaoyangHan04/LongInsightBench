    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are B/C. The two men were able to buy/load a Gautrain card at the ticket machine and use the turnstiles to access the platforms (Event 5). They also explained that a HowTrain card is required and riders must tap in and tap out like a bank card (Event 6), which likely helped them understand how to use the system. Option A is incorrect because they did not mention walking towards the station entrance until after buying a card. Option D is incorrect because the year 2010 is mentioned in relation to the train's construction but does not describe any of the steps taken by the men to board it.",

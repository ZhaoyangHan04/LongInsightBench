    "model_answer": "The most direct setup for the group watching a brass band perform in the French Quarter is option B: While out on the streets, they remark that they hear jazz/trumpets and say they love New Orleans, as visuals show a street musician and bustling crowds. This indicates that they have already developed an appreciation for New Orleans' culture and music scene, making them more likely to seek out musical performances when they're there. Options A, C, and D do not specifically relate to the group's eventual visit to the French Quarter and watching a brass band perform.",

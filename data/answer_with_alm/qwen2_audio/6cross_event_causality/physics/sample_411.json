    "model_answer": "The events that most directly enabled the start-of-scan state were A: Gradually ramping the X-ray generator voltage/current to the target power in XRD Commander with rests between increments (event 5) and C: Locking the sample holder in place and closing the enclosure doors so the alarm stops blinking (event 3). These events set up the necessary conditions for taking an X-ray diffraction pattern, which is required for the scan to begin. Option B involves creating a scan method, but it does not specify the actual start of the scan. Option D only deals with opening the instrument's doors, which is a separate process from starting the scan.",

    "model_answer": "The automatic shutter closure after the scan is complete is most likely due to the use of an X-ray diffractometer software called XRD Wizard. In event 4, the user defines and saves the scan method within this software, including parameters such as the range, step size, time per step, and power limits. This saved method is then used by the software during the actual scan. Therefore, option C (defining and saving the scan method in XRD Wizard) is the most likely correct answer. Options A, B, and D are not directly related to the automatic shutter closure.",

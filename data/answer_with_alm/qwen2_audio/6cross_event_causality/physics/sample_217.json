In event 4, the speaker presents the mismatch between the theoretical strength of five times higher than experimental and the actual measurement shown on the tablet. This discrepancy led the speaker to reconsider their previous assumptions about the bond-density model and the mechanism of plastic deformation of metals.",

    "model_answer": "The speaker's explanation builds upon the observations made in events 6 and 7. Options A and B both describe the formation of defects and the ability of these defects to enable plastic deformation through bond breaking and reforming. Option C mentions the speaker's intention to illustrate the mechanism on the tablet, which suggests they have a visual representation of the process. Option D does not seem directly related to the setup of the current explanation. Therefore, the most relevant options are A and B.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Demonstrations and explanations of the deceleration sled enabling controlled, repeatable occupant-protection tests (events 1 and 3). These events likely led to the development of innovative child seats and new safety standards by showcasing the effectiveness of the deceleration sled in simulating real-life crash scenarios and measuring occupant protection. The use of instrumented crash test dummies (ATDs), acceleration-duration metrics, and general full-vehicle crash footage were also important tools in this process but did not directly enable the innovation of child seats and new safety standards.",

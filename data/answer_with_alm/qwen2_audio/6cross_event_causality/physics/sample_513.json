    "model_answer": "The segments that most directly laid the groundwork for the tribute were A: The segment that introduces Heisenberg explicitly, B: The segment that provides experimental support, and C: The segment that expands to implications and applications. These segments provided context about Heisenberg's contributions to quantum mechanics and his uncertainty principle, as well as discussed experimental evidence supporting its validity. This foundational knowledge allowed for a meaningful reflection on Heisenberg's lasting impact on the field.",

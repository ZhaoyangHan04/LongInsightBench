    "model_answer": "The events that most directly set up and caused the synthesis of the concept of stopping distance in relation to thinking distance and braking distance are:\n\nA: Event 2: The teacher defines thinking distance as d = v × t on the whiteboard and explains the distance–speed–time “magic triangle,” which lays the foundation for understanding the relationship between distance, speed, and time.\nB: Event 5: The teacher introduces braking distance, defining it and listing how initial speed, road condition, and tire/brake condition affect it. This builds upon the previous discussion of thinking distance and helps students understand the additional factor that contributes to stopping distance.\nC: Event 0: The teacher starts by describing a real-life scenario involving a cat crossing the road, which triggers the need for immediate braking. This event sets the context for the lesson and makes the topic of stopping distance relevant and engaging for students.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, B, and C.",

    "model_answer": "The event that most directly led to the emphasis on factors affecting thinking and braking distances is likely option C: Event 0, where the teacher presents the scenario of a cat in the road and names reaction time, speed, and car condition as key factors in whether you hit the cat. This event sets the context for the lesson and highlights the importance of understanding these factors when making decisions related to driving and braking. The subsequent events build upon this foundation by providing additional information and examples related to these factors.",

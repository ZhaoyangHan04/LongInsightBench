    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Event 10: Identifying sulfur hydride as a stabilized metallic hydride and observing, at about −70°C and ~1.5 Mbars, the formation of Cooper pairs enabling zero-resistance current.\nThis event was crucial because it identified sulfur hydride as a stable metallic hydride, which led to the discovery of its superconducting properties under extreme conditions. This finding was essential for understanding the mechanisms behind superconductivity and setting the stage for further research on high-pressure superconductivity.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A, B, C, D. All four events have contributed to the researcher's shift in strategy to search for materials with high-temperature superconductivity without pressure. Event 1 highlights the practical and resource limitations of the high-pressure hydride work, which involves breaking many diamonds each year. Event 7 demonstrates the fragility of diamonds under high stress, which could impact the stability of any superconducting material created through high-pressure methods. Event 11 shows that even with the recent success in creating superconductors using hydrogen sulfide under extreme conditions, there is still a need for materials that can be used at room temperature or ambient pressure. Finally, Event 4 references the theoretical idealism of using hydrogen as a superconductor, implying that there may be a desire to explore alternative approaches beyond those that rely on high pressure and extreme temperatures.",

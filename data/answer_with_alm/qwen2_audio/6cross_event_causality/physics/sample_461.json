    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 6's recognition that the planetary picture fails (electrons can't stand still), Event 7's audio explanation that accelerating charges radiate and would spiral inward unless special orbits exist, and Event 8's visual/audio demonstration that only whole-number-wavelength standing-wave orbits are stable.\n\nThese events lay the foundation for understanding that electrons in an atom occupy specific energy levels or orbits, which leads to the emission of electromagnetic radiation when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one. This concept is crucial for explaining the discrete nature of spectral lines observed in hydrogen spectra, as well as other atomic spectra. The Bohr model, introduced later in the course, builds upon this idea by postulating that electrons move in circular orbits around the nucleus, but it is ultimately based on the principles established in Events 6-8.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 7’s stated flaw of the planetary model (accelerating electrons radiate), Event 8’s Bohr/de Broglie whole-number-wavelength standing-wave orbits (constructive vs. destructive interference), and Event 9’s visual/audio presentation of discrete energy levels and spectral validation.\nThese events laid the foundation for the understanding of atomic structure and the behavior of electrons in an atom. The planetary model was flawed because it assumed that electrons would continue to move in circular paths forever, which led to the realization that electrons do not stay in fixed positions but instead move around the nucleus in elliptical orbits. This idea was later confirmed through experiments such as those conducted by Bohr and de Broglie, which showed that electrons exhibit quantized energy states and wave-like properties. These findings were further supported by the discovery of discrete energy levels and spectral lines through experiments like those presented in Event 9.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 7: The speaker replaces the bumper force with a string tension roughly parallel to the plane and replaces the normal force with a string tension perpendicular to the plane by routing strings over pulleys.\n\nExplanation: In event 7, the speaker explains how they replaced the forces acting on the truck using strings and pulleys. This setup is necessary to balance the forces later in the process, which leads to the final result of the truck hanging in the same orientation as on the plane. The other events do not directly set up this outcome.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Event 2: Introducing the three forces on the truck (mg, normal N, and bumper force F) and adding their vectors to the diagram.\n\nIn event 2, the speaker introduced the three forces acting on the truck: the weight of the truck (mg), the normal force exerted by the plane (N), and the bumper force (F). By adding these vectors to the diagram, the speaker was able to visualize the forces in equilibrium and identify the components mgcosθ and mgsinθ. These components were labeled based on the direction of the weight vector relative to the horizontal and vertical axes established in event 3.",

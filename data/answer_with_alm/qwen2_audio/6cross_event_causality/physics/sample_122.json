    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are C: Event 9: He uses FG = mg and trigonometry to solve the equations for friction and normal force.\n\nExplanation:\nEvent 9 involved using the equation FG = mg to find the weight of the box, which was then used to find the normal force using trigonometry. This allowed the instructor to calculate the friction force and verify that it matched the given value, thus solving the simple Newton's Law problem.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Event 4: Hands-on verification procedureâ€”circuit assembled, plugs adjusted, rheostat varied to get deflections; readings of the standard voltmeter and the converted galvanometer are taken and their difference (error) is computed over multiple observations.\n\nThis step involved physically assembling the circuit, adjusting the rheostat to obtain different deflections, taking readings of both the standard voltmeter and the converted galvanometer, and computing the error between them. This process provided hands-on experience with the conversion process and ensured that the conversion was accurate and effective. The small difference between the standard and converted voltmeter readings indicates that the conversion was successful, as expected from the calculations made earlier in events 1 and 3.",

    "model_answer": "The prior activities most likely motivated and directly led to the emphasis on precautions and error sources in event 9 were events 4, 6, and 7. These events focused on practical applications of electrical measurements, such as assembling equipment, adjusting rheostats, calculating differences, and creating a verification table. As such, they highlighted the importance of careful technique and the potential for errors in these types of experiments.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: B: Event 3: The speaker asks what the magnetic flux of a dipole would be and concludes it is zero, paralleling the electric dipole; visuals show magnet field lines entering and leaving the surface. This event directly led to the conclusion in Gauss's Law for Magnetism as it showed that the magnetic field lines around a dipole cancel each other out, resulting in zero magnetic flux.",

This event directly sets up the speculation by contrasting the electric and magnetic Gauss laws and underscoring the absence of magnetic monopoles through both on-screen graphics and narration.",

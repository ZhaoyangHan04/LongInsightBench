    "model_answer": "The foundations leading to the conclusion about diffraction in Event 11 were established by the following events:\n\nA) Event 10: The diagrams and narration explained how diffraction occurs as waves spread out after passing through a slit, which lays the groundwork for understanding how sound waves can be diffracted around a doorway.\nB) Event 0: The introduction and narration establish that sound waves are indeed waves that transfer energy, providing context for the discussion of diffraction.\nC) Event 3: The guitar scene where the frequency of sound is defined in hertz and the human hearing range is mentioned helps to anchor the concept of sound waves having specific frequencies within the audible spectrum.\nD) Event 9: Although refraction is related to the bending of light waves when passing through different materials, it does not directly contribute to the understanding of diffraction in the context of sound waves around a doorway.\n\nTherefore, the selected options are A, B, and C.",

In event 1, she only stated her intention to find the focal point and did not describe any experimental procedures. In event 3, she demonstrated the reflection from a spherical mirror but did not use a laser level or adjust the mirror's position. In event 0, she introduced the necessary vocabulary but did not describe any specific actions related to finding the focal point.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 5 — She measures and labels the focal point and center of curvature (stating the focal point is half the radius and giving a measured distance), marking F and C on the diagram.\n\nThis prior action is directly linked to the image identification because measuring and labeling the focal point and center of curvature provides essential information about the mirror's properties. This knowledge helps her understand how the mirror will form an inverted image and how it will affect the size of the image. By stating that the focal point is half the radius and providing a measured distance, she sets the stage for understanding the mechanics of how light is reflected in a concave mirror.",

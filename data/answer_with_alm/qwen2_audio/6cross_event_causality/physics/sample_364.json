    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Event 0: The balance scale labeled “Energy” and “Mass” under E=mc^2 while the narrator introduces mass–energy equivalence and hints at creating mass (and a detour toward pair production).\n\nThe concept of mass-energy equivalence, which is stated in Einstein's famous equation E=mc², forms the foundation for understanding how energy and mass are related. This equation implies that energy can be converted into mass and vice versa, which sets the stage for discussions about creating mass through nuclear reactions like fusion and fission. Additionally, the mention of pair production in relation to creating mass also ties back to the concept of energy and matter being interchangeable, which is introduced in Event 0.",

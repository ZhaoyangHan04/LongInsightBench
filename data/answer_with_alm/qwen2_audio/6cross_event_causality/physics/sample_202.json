    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are B/C. Events 6 and 9 set the foundation for understanding the relationship between friction, normal force, and force balance. Event 6 provides a mathematical derivation that relates F_max to N, and event 9 reinforces this concept by discussing the forces acting on two blocks in contact. These events establish the necessary conditions for the existence of a friction force as described in event 10.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are B and C.\nEvent 4 directly led to the instructor using V0 = 900 m/s because it involved computing the end-of-phase-one state, which included the final velocity of the rocket. Event 6 confirmed this velocity by stating that the upward velocity was 900 m/s and would be decelerated by 9.81 m/s^2 during phase two. Option A does not mention the final velocity used in the calculation, and option D does not relate to the specific calculation of V0.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: (event_id: 11) He states \"we'll solve this for T\" while working through the freefall equation; calculator sounds and ongoing algebra lead directly to the phase-three time whose numeric result (~105.7 s) is finalized in event 12.\nExplanation: The calculation of the time in the air involves solving the freefall equation, which is done using the time elapsed since the rocket's acceleration stopped (91.7 seconds), the velocity at that point (zero), and the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2). This calculation leads to a final time close to 105.7 seconds, which is mentioned in event 12. Therefore, option C provides the necessary information to answer the question.",

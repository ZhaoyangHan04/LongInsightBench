    "model_answer": "Answer: A/B/C\nThe three events mentioned in the question each contribute uniquely to the concept of time and its relationship to space. Event 1 introduces the idea of Einstein's relativity and the concept of imaginary time, which forms the foundation of quantum mechanics. Event 2 builds upon this by introducing the concept of absolute time and its connection to the quantum foam. Event 0 sets the stage for these discussions by framing the problem of understanding time within the context of global crises and the need for a new perspective. Together, these three events lay the groundwork for the concept of a reference clock that is based on quantum mechanics and the structure of space-time.",

This event lays the foundation for the idea of interconnectedness and the necessity for collaboration in solving social and environmental problems, which aligns with the advocacy of effective altruism and safe quantum energy distribution in event 10.",

    "model_answer": "The equation E = hf - Φ is from quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of particles like electrons at the atomic level. This equation is based on the idea that electrons absorb and emit photons of light at specific frequencies, leading to changes in their energy levels. \n\nTherefore, the direct events that led to the introduction of this equation were likely:\n\n- Event 3: The animation of a light bulb sending a red wavy line to a metal surface and yellow spheres (electrons) being ejected, while the speaker explains Hertz’s discovery that UV light knocks electrons off metal. This event introduces the concept of light and its ability to interact with matter, which is crucial for understanding quantum mechanics.\n\n- Event 4: The sequence contrasting a speaker (sound waves) and a light bulb, while the narrator explains that increasing light intensity raises the number of electrons but not their speed, and increasing frequency raises their energy. This event reinforces the idea that light has both wave-like and particle-like properties, which is important for understanding quantum mechanics.\n\n- Event 5: The summary with on-screen text and the beach-wave analogy, where the narrator reiterates the two surprising results and frames them as a lead-in to Einstein’s successful explanation. This event does not directly relate to the",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Event 3: The depiction of electrons being ejected from a metal by light (red wavy line and yellow spheres), accompanied by narration about UV light producing sparks by knocking off electrons. This event introduces the concept of the photoelectric effect, which is fundamental to understanding how solar panels work and has practical applications such as night-vision devices. The other events do not directly relate to the development of photoelectric applications.",

They also establish the basis for understanding how polarizing filters work and how they can be used to control the amount of light passing through them.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are B/C. \n\nEvent 1 explains how polarized sunglasses work by having a vertical filter that cuts out horizontally polarized light. This information sets the expectation that a polarized source should indeed brighten or darken with analyzer orientation. \n\nEvent 4 also relates to polarization, as it shows how the detector readings change with grid orientation for microwaves, which is relevant to understanding polarization. \n\nTherefore, these events directly led to the conclusion drawn in event 11 about the brightness of the light behind the presenter not changing with polarization.",

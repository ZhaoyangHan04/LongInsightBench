    "model_answer": "The events that most directly set up and cause the mathematical result to be introduced are A: Event 4: The visual simulation of many colliding particles and the narrator’s introduction of Ludwig Boltzmann and statistical mechanics as a way to make definite statistical statements, and B: Event 5: The “boxes and balls” random-transfer simulation (scaling to a thousand boxes) used by the narrator to motivate emergent distributions. These events introduce the concepts of statistical mechanics and the idea of emergent behavior from simple rules, which are essential for understanding the Boltzmann distribution and the equation <E> = kT.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 0: The split-screen light bulbs and the narrator’s statement that the temperature-intensity-wavelength problem for incandescent light motivated quantum theory.\nEvent 0 explains the origin of the concept of quantum mechanics, which was needed to explain the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level, including the emission of electromagnetic radiation from hot objects like light bulbs. This event laid the foundation for the subsequent events in the series that build upon the concepts of quantum mechanics.",

    "model_answer": "The events that most directly enabled the instructor to arrive at the formula V^2 = μ_s g r and start the substitution were:\n\nA: Event 8: He states that for circular motion the acceleration toward the center is v^2/r and points to F_net = m v^2/r on the board. This event introduced the concept of centripetal acceleration and its relation to force and velocity.\n\nC: Event 7: He sets forces in the vertical direction to sum to zero (N − mg = 0), writing N = mg on the whiteboard. This event established the balance of forces in the vertical direction, which is necessary to determine the magnitude of the frictional force.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A,C).",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A, B, D. These events directly led to the instructor proposing a practical speed limit of about 25 miles per hour. In event 12, the instructor calculates the velocity using the formula V = √(μ_s g r), where he plug in the given values for μ_s, g, and r. This sets the stage for the discussion of speed limits. In event 4, the instructor establishes the necessary inputs by writing down the value of r on the board, which is relevant for the calculation of friction. Additionally, in event 10, the instructor explains the force model and uses it to derive the equation F_friction = μ N, which is crucial for understanding the factors that affect vehicle speed. Finally, the fact that the instructor encourages viewers to try the problem independently suggests that he wants them to think critically about the topic, rather than simply accepting his solution without questioning it.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 1 – Superposition principle with equal amplitudes: visuals show Y = Y1 + Y2 and discuss combining crests/troughs; audio explicitly covers the equal-amplitude case giving values like 2Y and −2Y.\nThis sub-event is directly related because it introduces the concept of superposition of waves and shows how two waves can be combined to form a resultant wave with twice the amplitude at any point. This is essential for understanding the interference patterns observed in the double-slit experiment, which is further explained in Event 13. The other events are either preliminary to or unrelated to the calculation of interference intensity.",

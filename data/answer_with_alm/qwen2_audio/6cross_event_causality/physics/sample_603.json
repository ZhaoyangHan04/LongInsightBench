    "model_answer": "The correct answer is likely C: Event 10 (earlier sub-event). This event involves pressing the soft putty into molds and then taking it off to cure, which transforms it into a solid before impact testing. This transformation is what leads to the dense, bouncy solid that is observed in event 10. \n\nOption A describes the properties of viscoelastic silicone rubber, which may be relevant to event 10 but does not directly lead to the final outcome. Option B describes the time-dependent stiffness of the rubber, which may also be relevant to event 10 but still does not directly lead to the final outcome. Option D describes the process of making a silicone rubber object through condensation cure, which is similar to event 10 but does not describe the final properties of the object.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 4: Durometer measurement showing the viscoelastic silicone rubber’s reading changes with time, becoming softer the longer it is held—evidence of time-dependent response.\n\nThis event provides evidence that the viscoelastic silicone rubber's stiffness depends on time. When the cylinder is pressed heavily, the durometer reading shows that the rubber becomes softer over time, indicating that it is more susceptible to deformation under pressure. This property is crucial in understanding why the rubber resists quick deformation yet recovers gradually over time as it has more time to deform and return to its original shape. \n\nOption B (Event 1) describes the material's behavior when life slows down but does not specifically mention the durometer measurement or the effect of time on its stiffness. Option C only mentions the material's stiffness when things happen quickly and does not provide any information about its recovery over time. Option D (Event 6) describes a specific specimen's behavior, which is different from the general behavior of the viscoelastic silicone rubber described in the audio clip.",

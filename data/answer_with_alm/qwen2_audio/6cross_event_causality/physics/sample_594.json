    "model_answer": "The answer is (B). Event 9 directly contributes to the final categorization and clarification because it describes wavefronts as particles vibrating in sync on spheres around a light source, which lays the foundation for understanding the spherical nature of waves. This concept is further elaborated upon in subsequent events but is crucial for the initial categorization of wavefront shapes.",

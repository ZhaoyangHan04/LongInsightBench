    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 4: The glass problem setup (visual shows energy added +28.349 kJ and temperatures 12.62°C → 27.68°C with unknown mass; audio states the scenario and that mass is the unknown).\n\nThis event provides crucial context for understanding what was measured and how it relates to other events. It sets up the experimental conditions and provides the initial temperature measurement, which is necessary for calculating the change in temperature and energy transfer. Additionally, the mention of an 'unknown mass' indicates that the result of this event is needed to determine the mass of the substance being studied.",

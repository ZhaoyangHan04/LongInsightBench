    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are A and B. \n\nOption A describes the physical setup where the speaker builds a shared rolling platform for multiple pendula, which introduces coupling between them through their common support. This setup sets up the coupled, energy-dissipating behavior seen in the resulting trace.\n\nOption B explains the mathematical modeling of the system by adding a damping term (-kx^2) to the original undamped single-pendulum equation. This damping term represents the energy dissipation due to friction and other dissipative forces acting on the pendula.\n\nTogether, these two events establish the basic ingredients for simulating the coupled, energy-dissipating behavior of the pendula system using numerical methods.",

Of the above events, only event 10 (the proposal and build of the two pendula on the shared platform) seems likely to have led to the final state of the system. The other events either don't affect the motion of the pendulums or occur after the pendulums are already on the platform.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A, B, C, D\nThe four earlier events or sub-events that most directly contribute to the result of momentum being gained in the downhill scene are:\n\nA) Event 2 - The on-screen formula \"Gravitational potential energy = mass x acc. gravity x height\" and narration that gravity speeds a car downhill, providing the mechanism for increasing speed. This establishes the concept of gravitational potential energy being converted into kinetic energy.\n\nB) Event 1 - The on-screen \"momentum = mass x velocity\" and narration that stationary objects have zero momentum while moving ones have non-zero momentum. This links increased speed to increased momentum, which is necessary for the car's momentum to increase as it rolls down the hill.\n\nC) Event 0 - The opening identification of \"Energy of position\" (gravitational potential energy) and mention of kinetic energy and momentum, setting the conceptual baseline for energy conversion. This provides the context for understanding how energy from gravitational potential is transformed into other forms, such as kinetic energy.\n\nD) Event 9 - The later example comparing a large rock to a pebble rolling down a hill near a stone wall, discussing mass effects on momentum. This reinforces the idea that heavier objects will experience greater changes in momentum when they move, which",

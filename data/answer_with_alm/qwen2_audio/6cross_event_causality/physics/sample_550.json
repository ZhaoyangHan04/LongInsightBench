    "model_answer": "The preceding chain of explanations that most directly causes the result sub-event where the host introduces “Nuclear Fission Breaking Nuclei Apart” and shows images of “Fat Man” and “Little Boy” is option D: Events 4 → 5 → 7: Introducing Einstein’s E=mc^2, annotating mass–energy equivalence (small mass gives large energy), and stating that lost mass is converted into energy in nuclear reactions.\n\nThis sequence sets the foundation for understanding nuclear fission and the concept of mass-energy equivalence, which is crucial for explaining how nuclear bombs work. The subsequent events build upon this introduction by discussing the actual process of nuclear fission and its applications, leading up to the display of images of the atomic bombs used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Events 4 → 5 → 6: Introducing Einstein’s E=mc^2, detailing that mass and energy are interchangeable (small mass gives large energy), and demonstrating nuclear mass defect with a balance showing a nucleus vs separated nucleons.\n\nIn events 4, 5, and 6, the speaker explains the concept of mass-energy equivalence (E=mc^2) and demonstrates it through experiments with a balance showing a nucleus versus the individual nucleons that make up the nucleus. This directly relates to the concept of converting mass into energy, which is evident in the final result sub-event where the host states that the mass is not lost but has been converted into energy.",

    "model_answer": "The closest events would be A and C, as they both relate to the work of committees and the production of reports. Event 3 is likely a result of the committee's work rather than driving it. Event 2 involves the scrutiny function of parliament, which could influence the committee's work, but does not directly lead to the production of a report. Event 9 relates to engagement and participation in politics, which could be a byproduct of the committee's work, but again, does not directly drive it. Option D does not seem to be related to the events mentioned.",

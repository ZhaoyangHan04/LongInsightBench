    "model_answer": "The events that most directly set up and cause the clarification are:\n\nA) Event 8: The MAGELLAN'S USE segment where the speaker details Magellan coating himself in liquid poison as armor, summoning hydras, and using the high-speed “venom road,” shown alongside visuals of menacing purple constructs.\n\nThis event establishes that the Doku Doku no Mi allows its user to generate and manipulate various types of poison, which contradicts the initial classification of the fruit as a Logia type. It also sets the stage for the subsequent discussion about the fruit's true nature.\n\nB) Event 1: The early classification segment that the Doku Doku no Mi is Paramecia (not Logia) and cannot transform the user into poison, despite appearances of being covered in “death goo,” shown with the purple-dripping character labeled DOKU DOKU.\n\nThis event reinforces the idea that the Doku Doku no Mi is not a Logia type and can only generate poison. It also clarifies that the fruit's appearance is misleading and does not reflect its true abilities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A and B.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 6: The DETAILED POWERS segment explaining poison typings (liquid vs gas), control of potency, and mimicking substances like tear gas, over visuals of intense confrontations and the DETAILED POWERS label. This segment likely provided insights into the毒属性 (poison type) of the fruit, which could be relevant to its combat and containment capabilities. Additionally, the mention of poison typing and control over potency aligns with the fruit's ability to generate and manipulate various types of poison as described in the audio clip.",

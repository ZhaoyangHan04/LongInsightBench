    "model_answer": "The preceding sub-event that most directly set up and caused the timed measurement step was likely option A, Event 5: The operator inserts the sedimentation pipette into the stand and begins the setup while timer-related handling sounds are heard, leading to placing the tube and starting timing. This event indicates that the necessary equipment and setup for the timed measurement were already prepared, and the pipette was ready to be used.",

    "model_answer": "The event that most directly led to the emphasis on verifying tube graduations for accurate ESR readings was likely Event 6 (audio/visual), where it was mentioned that the ESR reading should be reported in millimeters after one hour. This implies that precise linear graduations are critical for correct numeric reporting. Option C best fits this description.",

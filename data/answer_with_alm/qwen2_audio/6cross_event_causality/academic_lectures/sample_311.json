    "model_answer": "The preceding events that most directly set up the need for one-way valves in淋巴 flow are:\n\nA) Event 2: The lack of a heart in the lymphatic system means lymph needs a way to flow without the ability to pump it like blood. This makes the presence of one-way valves necessary to ensure lymph flows in only one direction.\nB) Event 3: The movement of lymph through skeletal muscles helps to move lymph through the lymph vessels, which also contributes to the need for one-way valves to prevent backflow.\nC) Event 1: The interstitial fluid that diffuses back into capillaries accounts for much of the lymph液 that needs to be moved by the lymphatic system. This fluid pressure can help push lymph through the vessels, but it also creates the need for one-way valves to prevent backflow.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, B, and C.",

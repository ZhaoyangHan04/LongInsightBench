    "model_answer": "The events that led to the current format were likely a combination of A, C, and D. The mention of including sample answers and resources in Event 2 suggests that the host was planning ahead for different types of content. Event 4, where the host demonstrated a bad example of how not to answer a question, may have also influenced the decision to switch to the interview-style format. Additionally, the host's desire to engage with the audience by asking them about their programs of study in Event 5 may have been a factor in creating a more interactive and engaging content piece. Ultimately, it seems that the host used these various events as opportunities to refine and improve their approach to creating useful and informative videos for their audience.",

    "model_answer": "The events that most plausibly build to and cause the speaker's conclusion are:\n\nA: Event 3 — He lays a theological foundation: icons as images revealing God’s experience and cites Colossians 1:15, with on-screen points 1–3. This event establishes the premise that icons serve a purpose in revealing God's experience through visual representation.\n\nB: Event 7 — He clarifies that God’s concern is worshipping other gods, not imagery per se, and emphasizes worshipping the Creator rather than created things. This event reinforces the idea that the focus should be on worshiping the true God and not creating images of him.\n\nC: Event 10 — He reads passages about cherubim crafted for the Tabernacle (Exodus 36:8; 37:7-9), showing God commanded artistic imagery. This event provides specific examples of biblical imagery and its use in worship.\n\nTherefore, the combination of these events helps the speaker build a strong theological foundation for the role of icons in worship while also emphasizing the importance of avoiding the worship of created things.",

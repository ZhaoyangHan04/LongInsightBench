    "model_answer": "The events that most directly build the anatomical and functional chain necessary to justify the statement about the Papez circuit being the bridge between emotional, endocrine, visceral, and voluntary responses are:\n\nA) Event 8: This event describes the tracing of the hippocampal outflow via the fornix to the mammillary bodies and the mammillothalamic tract to the limbic lobe, which includes the classic Papez circuit. The visuals and narration help establish the anatomical connections within the circuit.\n\nB) Event 6: This event labels and explains the cortical components of the limbic lobe, including the cingulate gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus, as well as the uncus. These structures form part of the pathway through which the Papez circuit communicates with other areas of the brain.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A and B.",

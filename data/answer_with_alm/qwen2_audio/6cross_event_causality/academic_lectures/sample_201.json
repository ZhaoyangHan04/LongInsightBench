The other events may have contributed to our current understanding of human evolution, but they are not directly linked to the revised timeline for people reaching Australia.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible preceding events leading to the regional board's unqualified endorsement in event 15 were A and C. Option A is likely because engaging with traditional owners and focusing on recovering human DNA was a response to Aboriginal cultural concerns, which suggests that the board was considering the ethical implications of the research. Option C is also likely because Professor Willerslev coming to Australia and discussing the research with the board would have helped build support for the project within the scientific community. Option B and D do not seem directly related to the regional board's endorsement.",

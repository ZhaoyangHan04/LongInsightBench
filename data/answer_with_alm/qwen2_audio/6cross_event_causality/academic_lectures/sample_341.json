    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The festival-food stomachache recollections (event 1) and the class discussion that contrasted natural food acids with corrosive lab acids while noting a father’s stomach ache (event 4), followed by the teacher’s explanation that the antacid medicine is a base that nullifies excess stomach acid (earlier in event 5).\n\nThis sequence of events directly led to the girl's conclusion that her father felt better two hours after taking the medicine. In event 1, the girl remembered her father having a stomachache after eating festival food. This memory was triggered during a class discussion about food acids and their properties. During this discussion, they also talked about how certain bases can neutralize excess stomach acid. This knowledge likely influenced the girl's understanding of why her father might feel better after taking antacid medication. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The stepwise lessons defining acids (event 7) and bases (event 8), followed by the teacher’s prompt asking what happens when acids and bases are mixed (event 9).\n\nThis sequence directly sets up the result sub-event in event 10 because it provides the foundational knowledge of acids and bases needed to understand their reactions with each other. The teacher's prompt also encourages students to think critically about chemical reactions, which leads to the discovery of salt formation when acids and bases mix. This sequence prepares students for the practical demonstration in event 10 where they will observe the reaction of an acid and a base forming salt.",

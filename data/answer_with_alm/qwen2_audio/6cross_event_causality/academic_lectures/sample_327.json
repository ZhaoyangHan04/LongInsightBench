This established the foundation for the subsequent events that led to the ranking outcome. Event 4 arranged the comparisons in a matrix and computed the normalized principal eigenvector to derive criterion weights, which emphasized memory's dominance. Finally, Event 5 presented the final criterion weights, which were used to evaluate the gadget models. These three events directly caused the ranking outcome of Model 3 having the highest ranking.",

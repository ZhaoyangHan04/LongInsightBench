    "model_answer": "The correct answer would be C: Event 6: Folding the CSR paper/drape to fully wrap the instruments, creating “lips” for easy opening and maintaining airflow before taping. This step involves wrapping the instruments in CSR paper/drape, ensuring that they are completely covered and protected. The paper/drape is then folded over itself to create sealed lips around the instruments, which helps maintain airflow during the autoclaving process. Once this step is complete, the pack is then sealed with autoclave tape and labeled with the date and initials. Therefore, option C is the correct answer as it outlines the crucial step of folding the paper/drape before sealing the pack.",

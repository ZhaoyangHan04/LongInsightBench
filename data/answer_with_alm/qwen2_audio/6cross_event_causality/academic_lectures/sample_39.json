Event 2 provided the information about the equipment used (colorimeter/spectrophotometer). Event 7 instructed how to obtain the absorbance reading for the sample. Event 9 informed us about the standard's absorbance measurement and concentration. Event 5 described the properties of the hemoglobin standard solution, including its concentration and photosensitivity.",

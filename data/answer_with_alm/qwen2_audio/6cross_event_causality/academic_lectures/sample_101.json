    "model_answer": "I would select A and C as they both indicate that the revenue increase is due to a change in price, either through an increase in rates for an electric company or an approved rate increase for an electric company. The fact that the magnitude of elasticity is less than one suggests that consumers may be insensitive to the price change, but it does not necessarily explain why revenue would go up. The airline example shows that elastic demand, where lowering prices can increase ticket sales and revenue, is different from the situation being discussed here.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The electricity segment that explicitly displays TR = P x Q while explaining revenue behavior, providing the formulaic link between price and quantity (event 10).\n\nThis event explains the concept of revenue and how it is directly proportional to the product's price and quantity sold. It sets the foundation for understanding that if both price and quantity change by the same percentage amounts in opposite directions, then revenue remains constant. This aligns with the scenario presented in the audio clip where the stick figure shows that although the price has increased by 10% and the quantity sold has decreased by 10%, the total revenue remains the same due to the proportionality relationship between price and quantity.",

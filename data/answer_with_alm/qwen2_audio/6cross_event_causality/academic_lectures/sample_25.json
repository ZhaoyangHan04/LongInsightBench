It also explains why the speaker would discuss strategies for the verbal section of the test. This event directly leads into the subsequent discussion about studying and preparing for the exam. The other events mentioned may be relevant to the topic, but they do not directly set up or trigger the man's reaction in Event 4.",

Additionally, the mention of navigating the GRE website in the video preview (Event 1) suggests that the topic of the video involves the GRE website, supporting option C. Option B does not fit as it only references sending scores and numbers, while Option D does not relate to the GRE website at all.",

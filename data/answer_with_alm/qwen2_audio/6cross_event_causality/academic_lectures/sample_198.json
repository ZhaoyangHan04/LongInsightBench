    "model_answer": "The most direct prompts for these precautions and setup choices were likely events 0 and 2. Event 0 laid the foundation for understanding the importance of surgical positioning and the need for secure restraints, which carries over into the selection of the prone Jackknife/Kraske setup. Event 2 introduced the specific requirements for the gravity-assisted position being considered, including the use of shoulder braces, which are necessary for the prone setup being chosen. Events 6 and 1 also provided relevant background information on positioning and restraints, but they did not specifically influence the selection of the current setup.",

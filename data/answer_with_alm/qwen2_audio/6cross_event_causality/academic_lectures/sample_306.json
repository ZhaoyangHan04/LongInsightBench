    "model_answer": "The most plausible arguments/sub-events leading to the emphasis on government responsibility in the given audio clip are:\n\nA: Event 10: The speaker's argument about the systemic problem of global poverty and the need for governments and corporations to address it aligns with the overall theme of the event, which focuses on the role of government in solving societal issues.\nB: Event 7: The speaker's questioning of aid effectiveness and the limitations of ad hoc aid also fits within the broader context of the event, which likely explores various approaches to tackling social and economic problems.\nC: Event 6: Although the speaker's counterargument about the non-absolute nature of the duty to help does not directly relate to the topic of government responsibility, it could still be seen as relevant within the broader conversation about individual and collective obligations.\nD: Event 3: While the speaker's argument about the duty to prevent suffering and criticism of the charity/duty distinction do not seem directly related to the topic of government responsibility, they could still be seen as relevant within the broader conversation about ethical considerations and the role of government in promoting well-being.",

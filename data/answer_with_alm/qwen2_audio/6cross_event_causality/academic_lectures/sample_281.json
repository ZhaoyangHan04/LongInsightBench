    "model_answer": "The events that most directly set up the summary list in event 10 are A and C. In event 2, the common-sense view segment lays the foundation for understanding the relationship between刺激 (stimulus), 情绪 (emotion), and 起伏 (arousal) as depicted in the diagram. This is relevant when discussing the summary list's purpose of outlining the four theories. In event 8, the detailed explanation of the Schachter-Singer theory introduces the concept of cognitive factors influencing emotion, which complements the diagram in event 2. Both events help establish the foundational knowledge necessary for the subsequent presentation of the summary list.",

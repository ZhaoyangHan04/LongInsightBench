    "model_answer": "I would select A, C, and D. \n\nEvent 7 introduces the concept that words can move around while prefixes/suffixes cannot, which is relevant to understanding the behavior of syllables. This information sets the stage for the idea that syllable boundaries may not always align with word boundaries.\n\nEvent 9 provides additional context on the subject of word boundaries and the use of visual aids to illustrate them. It also reinforces the notion that word boundaries can be fuzzy and may not always correspond to morphemes.\n\nEvent 2, while discussing the difference between Spanish and English, does not directly relate to the topic of syllable boundaries and word boundaries. \n\nOption B, about the assimilation of the -s suffix, is only indirectly related to the topic, as it deals with a specific aspect of word formation within English.",

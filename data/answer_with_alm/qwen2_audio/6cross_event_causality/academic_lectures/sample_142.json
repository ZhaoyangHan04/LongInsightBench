    "model_answer": "Answer: A: They fulfilled prerequisites—clean body, dress, and place; faced Qiblah with intention (Events 0–1)—and then actually initiated Salat with the opening Takbir at-Tahrima as taught (Event 2), allowing the standing recitation to proceed.\nExplanation: The audio describes the sequence of events leading up to the imam starting the prayer by reciting Surah Al-Fatiha. To reach this stage, several prerequisites must be met including a clean body (as indicated by the word 'clean'), wearing appropriate attire (as implied by the mention of dressing), facing the Qiblah (with the intention to pray), and initiating the prayer with the opening Takbir (Event 2). These actions set the stage for the imam to begin the standing recitation of Surah Al-Fatiha.",

    "model_answer": "The events that most directly set up and caused the conclusion in event 9 are:\n\nD: Event 2: The narrator introduces AAVE and notes it is often mislabeled as slang or “broken English,” while visuals show big-city backdrops (Chicago, Los Angeles, New York) and reacting stick figures.\n\nThis event provides context about how AAVE is perceived and discussed in popular culture, which sets the stage for the subsequent discussion of its status as a language variety. It also highlights the issue of misconceptions about AAVE's grammatical structure and usage, which will become even more relevant when the narrator discusses the examples from Arabic/Chinese and Chaucer/Shakespeare.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible option would be A: Event 5: A map of the Atlantic with arrows shows forced transatlantic movement while the speaker explains that separated groups diverge and that enslaved Africans were brought to the Americas. This event likely led to the diverse linguistic forms and spread of AAVE across the United States, as enslaved Africans were forcibly taken from their homes and transported across the Atlantic, leading to significant genetic and linguistic diversity among those who arrived in the Americas.",

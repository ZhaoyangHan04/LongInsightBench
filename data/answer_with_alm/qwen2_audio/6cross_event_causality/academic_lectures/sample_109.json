    "model_answer": "The answer is B: The segment where students and the teacher discuss hand picking, filtering tea (identified as sieving), give sieving examples, and the visual demo of liquid-solid filtration labeled “Solid” and “Liquid.”\n\nThis segment provides a direct link to the concept of separating substances, which is crucial for understanding the subsequent steps of handpicking, threshing, winnowing, and sieving. The demonstration of liquid-solid filtration also helps build upon this foundation by showing how different materials can be separated based on their density and other properties.",

    "model_answer": "The prior moments that set up the shift into wind-based separation are A and C. Option A describes children collecting materials and the teacher noting the difficulty of making art with them, which implies a need for a different method of separation. Option C references the previous segment on hand picking and sieving, which leads to the discussion of other methods of separation, including wind-based separation.",

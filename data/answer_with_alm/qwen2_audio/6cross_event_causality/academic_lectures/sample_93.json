    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on geography for help. After aligning the compass with the map in event 5, the speaker measures the angle between true north and the magnetic north using a protractor in event 3. This measurement is noted as 94 degrees and 01 minutes. In event 7, the speaker finds the mean magnetic declination of the area to be 23 degrees 01 west. Finally, in event 8, the speaker uses the formula magnetic bearing = true bearing + magnetic declination to calculate the final result of 117 degrees 01 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

    "model_answer": "Answer: C: Event 7 — The speaker identifies and writes the mean magnetic declination as “23° 01 West,” providing the second value required in the formula.\nExplanation: In event 7, the speaker explains that they found the true bearing by using a protractor and finds the angle to be approximately 94 degrees. They also mention that they need to add the magnetic declination to get the final magnetic bearing. This implies that they have already calculated the true bearing and needed to find the magnetic declination to complete the equation. Therefore, option C is the most likely correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Initial preparation with draping and numbing, including placing sticky and blue drapes and starting local anesthetic (events 0–1). These initial steps are crucial for the success of the procedure and set the stage for the rest of the events, including the expression and draining of the abscess (events 3–4) and the cleaning of the cyst wall (event 6). The wound dressing and packing protocol (event 7) is a separate step that follows the primary procedure.",

    "model_answer": "The earlier finding that led to the choice of packing the wound initially with povidone-iodine-soaked gauze was likely B: observation and expression of copious pus during drainage, with squeezing sounds and the doctor remarking there is so much pus (events 3–4). This indicates that the wound may have been infected, requiring additional measures to prevent further contamination and promote healing.",

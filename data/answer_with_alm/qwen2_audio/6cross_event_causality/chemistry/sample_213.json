    "model_answer": "The fog formation in event 6 was most likely caused by option A: Early preparation of dissolving hexamine tablets in water and adding benzyl chloride to the mixture (event 1). This combination could potentially generate hydrogen chloride gas upon reaction, which could react with moisture in the air to form fog.",

    "model_answer": "The options that most likely contributed to the persistent impurity are A and C. The use of hexamine tablets containing unknown impurities, as mentioned in event 1, could have introduced contamination into the benzaldehyde. Additionally, relying on calcium carbonate to neutralize HCl without proper filtration could have allowed undissolved impurities to remain in the final product. Both of these events occurred earlier in the process and may have impacted the quality of the benzaldehyde.",

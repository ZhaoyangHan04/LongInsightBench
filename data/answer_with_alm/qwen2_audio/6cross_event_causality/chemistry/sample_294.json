    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 2’s explanation of fluorescence with energy-level visuals, Event 3’s two-photon/longer-wavelength rationale making these chromophores attractive labels, and Event 8’s successful synthesis/deprotection sequence yielding resveratrone and iso-resveratrone for measurement.\n\nThis answer reflects the necessary chain of explanations and preparations that led to the fluorescence comparison. Event 2 provided insight into the properties of fluorescence and energy levels, which was crucial for understanding how to visualize the results. Event 3 explained the use of two-photon/longer-wavelength chromophores as suitable labels for such comparisons. Finally, Event 8 described the successful synthesis and deprotection sequences of resveratrone and iso-resveratrone, which allowed for their direct measurement and comparison.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 9’s decision (audio) to pivot to an iso-resveratrol derivative for click labeling due to stability, Event 10’s stepwise construction of a click-ready derivative (visuals and audio: protections, substitutions, epoxidation, and Olefination), and early Event 11 troubleshooting (audio: low-yield click with phenylacetylene and partial desilylation) that informed the protocol prior to global deprotection.\nThis decision was crucial as it allowed the team to overcome the stability issues they were facing with resveratrol, which made it challenging to perform the click reaction. By choosing an isomer that was more stable, they could proceed with the synthesis, and the subsequent steps involving protections, substitutions, epoxidation, and Olefination led to the successful formation of the labeled product. Additionally, the troubleshooting done during early events helped in optimizing the protocol, further enhancing the chances of success in the final global deprotection step.",

    "model_answer": "The events that most directly set up and necessitated the inversion of stereochemical bond display in event 10 were likely events 8 and 9. In event 8, the user drew a tetrahedral ethane framework by adding and orienting bonds, which created the initial stereochemical configuration. In event 9, the speaker introduced stereochemical bonds (wedge, hash, swiggle, four bond) and instructed using the wedge and then the hash bond on the ethane structure, asking to observe the changes. This event likely prompted the user to recall the wedge and hash bonds from event 9 and understand how they relate to stereochemistry. Therefore, events 8 and 9 are the most relevant to the inversion of stereochemical bond display in event 10.",

    "model_answer": "The preceding events that most directly led to the save action were A: Event 11: The speaker instructs to change bonds to add a hash bond in the ethane structure and then asks to save the file, and C: Event 3: The speaker demonstrates converting a single bond to a double bond and identifies the product as ethene. These events involved changes to the chemical structure, which prompted the user to save the project. Option B, about changing preferences, does not seem to be directly related to the save action, and option D is about a different topic altogether.",

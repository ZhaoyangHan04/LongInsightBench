    "model_answer": "The events that most plausibly set up the thermodynamics-based comparison in event 10 are A: Event 2 — Diagram and narration establishing solvent polarity as the key factor and showing ion stabilization via hydration shells, and C: Event 9 — Frame introducing “free energy of transfer” in on-screen text and audio noting that stronger solvent–solute interactions make solvation more favorable. These events establish the fundamental concepts of solvent polarity and its effect on ion stability and solvation, which are essential for understanding the thermodynamics of dissolution processes.",

    "model_answer": "The events that most directly caused the application-focused discussion were likely A: Event 11, B: Event 5, and C: Event 2. These events provided foundational knowledge about solvation, solvent polarity, and its effects on biomolecular interactions, which are crucial for understanding host-guest complexation and drug delivery. The initial definition of solvation and solubility in Event 1 set the stage for the subsequent discussions on the topic.",

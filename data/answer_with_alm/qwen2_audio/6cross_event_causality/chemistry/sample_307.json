    "model_answer": "The correct answer would be A: Event 7: The introduction and visual demonstration of a monochromator (prism and diffraction grating) that separates polychromatic light into component wavelengths, with audio explaining its role in a spectrometer.\nThis earlier sub-event sets up the foundation for understanding how the emitted light will be routed in the emission setup described in event 13. The monochromator is used to separate the different wavelengths of light, which allows for the measurement of specific wavelengths. This is crucial for the operation of the absorption spectrometer, as it ensures that only the desired wavelengths of light reach the sample.",

    "model_answer": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on chemistry for help. In event 8, the speaker builds upon the knowledge gained in events 7 and 4. Event 7 explains how a monochromator is used to select a single wavelength from a polychromatic light source, which is necessary for studying the absorption and emission of photons by molecules. Event 4 describes how the interaction between a photon's electric field and a molecule's fields leads to absorption or emission of light, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of photons in matter. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Event 4.\n\nAnswer: C: Event 4",

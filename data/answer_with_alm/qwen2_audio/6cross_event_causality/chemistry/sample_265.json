    "model_answer": "The events that directly caused the result of having only copper in the filter paper were:\n\nA) Event 2: Adding iron metal to the blue copper sulfate solution and stirring to speed the reaction, producing solid copper.\nC) Event 6: Pouring the reaction mixture through the funnel so that the solid copper is trapped on the filter paper while the blue filtrate passes through.\n\nExplanation:\nIn event 2, iron metal was added to the blue copper sulfate solution, which initiated a chemical reaction that produced solid copper. This reaction would have occurred more quickly if the mixture was stirred, as stated in option A.\nEvent 6 involved pouring the reaction mixture through a funnel, which allowed the solid copper to be filtered out of the solution. The filter paper caught the copper, leaving behind the blue filtrate containing copper ions. This process is consistent with what we observe in the video, where the funnel is used to separate the solid copper from the liquid.\nOption B, folding the filter paper, and option D, writing on paper, are not directly related to the production of pure copper in the filter paper. Option B involves preparing the filter paper for use, while option D simply notes the mass of the filter paper.",

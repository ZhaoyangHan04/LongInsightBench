    "model_answer": "The answer should be based on the diffraction pattern observed experimentally. The preferred growth direction of sodium chloride crystals is known to be along the c-axis, which is perpendicular to the surface of the plate. This means that when comparing the diffraction pattern of NaCl powder with that of NaCl crystals on glass, the intensity of the peaks corresponding to the c-axis will be higher for the latter. Therefore, option C, where the crystal top surface is aligned with the holder, is the most likely correct answer as it ensures that the crystal is grown on a flat surface, facilitating better comparison with the powder sample. Options A, B, and D are not directly related to preparing the samples for XRD analysis.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are B and C. Helium fusion (triple-alpha) begins, forming carbon-12 (and then oxygen-16 with added helium) in event 7, and prior hydrogen fusion steps produce helium-4 (helium “ash”) and large energy, building up conditions for later stages, in event 4. These events led to the formation of heavier elements in the star's core, eventually causing it to expand into a red giant.",

This sets the foundation for understanding that reactions like the decomposition of CaCO3 into CaO and CO2 gas, which has a positive enthalpy change (ΔH), will only occur spontaneously at elevated temperatures above room conditions. Therefore, the statement about limestone decomposing at 1100 K and not occurring at STP is directly supported by the information provided in event 9.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 1: Slide and narration defining a spontaneous process as happening without outside stimulus (with diffusion/effusion examples and molecules moving to equilibrium).\n\nIn event 1, the slide defines a spontaneous process as happening without outside stimulus, which is supported by the subsequent narration providing examples of spontaneous processes such as diffusion and effusion. This definition directly supports the depiction in event 3 where the arrows labeled \"spontaneous\" and \"nonspontaneous\" indicate that spontaneous processes occur in one direction and non-spontaneous processes occur in the opposite direction.",

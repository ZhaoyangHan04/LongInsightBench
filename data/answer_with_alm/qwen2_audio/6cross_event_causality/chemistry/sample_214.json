    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 2: Packing and attaching a drying tube (with anhydrous calcium sulfate/calcium chloride and glass wool), heat-drying the setup, then assembling the reflux apparatus to keep external moisture out.\nThis step was crucial as it prevented moisture from entering the apparatus and affecting the accuracy of the reaction. The drying tube, filled with anhydrous materials like calcium sulfate or calcium chloride, helped absorb any excess moisture that could have entered the setup during packing and assembly. Additionally, the use of glass wool further adsorbed moisture, ensuring a dry environment for the reaction to occur.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 5: Filling the balloon with inert gas via a syringe needle or three-way stopcock and attaching it to the reaction inlet.\n\nThis step was necessary to create an inert atmosphere in which the reaction could proceed safely. The balloon filled with nitrogen or argon was attached to the reaction inlet, ensuring that the gas mixture was introduced into the system. This setup allowed for heating under an inert atmosphere, as required for many chemical reactions.",

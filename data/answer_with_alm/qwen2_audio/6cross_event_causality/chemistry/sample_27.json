    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Events 4 and 5: After siphoning, hydrogen peroxide is added and diluted (video shows a PEROXID bottle and frothing), then the mixture is made alkaline and oxidized so that sodium chromate forms while iron stays insoluble (explained in audio), giving the yellow solution that turns orange when acidified.\n\nThis answer is based on the provided audio description of events 4 and 5 where hydrogen peroxide is used to create a yellow sodium chromate solution through oxidation. This solution is then combined with iron to form a precipitate, which is the source of the eventual orange coloration. The other options either do not involve the creation of a yellow chromate solution or do not specify the necessary steps leading up to the color change.",

    "model_answer": "The events that most directly set up the unsuccessful aluminum displacement attempt observed in event 10 are:\n\nA: Event 9: Filtering chromium carbonate with coffee filters and then dissolving it in acid to obtain chromium sulfate before attempting to displace chromium with aluminum. This step is crucial as it provides the necessary Chromium sulfate solution required for the displacement reaction.\n\nB: Event 7: Boiling the blue solution to drive off persistent hydrogen peroxide, making it safer and explicitly setting up the next step of precipitation and cleaning before conversion to chromium salts. This step helps in purifying the solution by removing impurities like hydrogen peroxide.\n\nC: Event 8: Adding sodium bicarbonate to the blue solution, causing fizzing/foam and forming a precipitated chromium salt he calls a pure salt of chromium, which is then filtered and used in later steps. While this step helps in separating the铬盐 from the solution, it does not directly set up the unsuccessful aluminum displacement attempt observed in event 10.\n\nD: Event 6: Acidifying sodium chromate to sodium dichromate, changing the solution from yellow to orange. This step is important as it converts the chromate to dichromate, which is a necessary intermediate for the displacement reaction. However, it",

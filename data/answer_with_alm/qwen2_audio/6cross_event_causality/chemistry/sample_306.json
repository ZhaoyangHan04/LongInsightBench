    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are A, B, C, D.\nExplanation: The chemical formula Ca(OH)2 requires placing the OH group in brackets because it is a polyatomic ion, which means it is made up of two or more atoms. This was introduced in Event 4, where the rule for indicating the number of polyatomic ions in brackets was explained. In Event 2, the rule for balancing charges through valencies was demonstrated, which also applies to the placement of brackets in chemical formulas. Event 3 emphasized the order of elements in a compound, which is relevant for writing the formula correctly. Finally, Event 8 noted that brackets are not necessary when there is only one polyatomic ion present, which applies to the case of Ca(OH)2 where there are no other polyatomic ions besides OH.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A, B, C, D.\nEvent 12 introduced the problem setup and the concept of mole ratios, which was essential for setting up the proportion in Event 13. Event 6 provided a detailed explanation of mole ratios and their conversion, which helped in understanding the balanced equation and setting up the proportion. Event 8 explained the steps to stoichiometric equations, including identifying knowns and unknowns and setting up proportions. Finally, Event 14 demonstrated how to solve for moles of N2 using mole ratios, which was relevant to the current problem setup in Event 13.",

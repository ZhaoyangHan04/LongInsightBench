    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 3: The detailed setup of “Electrolysis of H2SO4” at low current density, where he writes and points to the cathode/anode equations (H3O+ + e− → 1/2 H2 + H2O; 4OH− → 2H2O + O2 + 4e−) on the whiteboard while explaining their origin in audio.\n\nThis event directly caused the naming of Marshall's acid (peroxodisulfuric acid) and Caro's acid (peroxomonosulfuric acid) because it involved the electrochemical reaction of sulfuric acid under specific conditions, which led to the discovery of these acids. The other events mentioned may have contributed to the understanding of the topic, but they did not directly cause the naming of the acids.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Event 0: Visuals of planetary alignments and alchemical symbols with the title “ALCHEMY,” while a male narrator introduces the quest for the Philosopher’s Stone and the soul of all things.\nThis earlier sub-event lays the foundational groundwork for the explicit planetary–metal enumeration by introducing the concept of planetary alignments and alchemical symbols, which are key components of alchemy. The title \"ALCHEMY\" also emphasizes the connection between alchemy and the pursuit of the Philosopher's Stone, highlighting the idea of transmutation and transformation. These themes are carried forward in later sub-events, such as Event 2, where the visual representation of the alchemical table of symbols reinforces these concepts.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is B: Event 5: A deep-voiced narrator insists metals have seed and explains how that seed is activated, with visuals of a detailed apparatus diagram that implies a concrete method.\nThis event directly motivates and necessitates the dissolution-re restoration process because the narrator explains that metals have a seed that can be activated through a specific method involving a detailed apparatus diagram. This implies that the process of dissolving and restoring gold involves activating the seed of gold and transforming it into a new and pure body. The other events do not provide as direct a connection to the dissolution-restoration process.",

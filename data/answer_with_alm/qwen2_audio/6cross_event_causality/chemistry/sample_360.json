    "model_answer": "The answer must relate to the concept of heat energy and changes in enthalpy. Events 2 and 7 both discuss the calculation of enthalpy change (Î”H) and its relation to whether a reaction is exothermic or endothermic. Therefore, both A and C are correct choices. Option D does not seem to be related to the topic of enthalpy and exothermic reactions.",

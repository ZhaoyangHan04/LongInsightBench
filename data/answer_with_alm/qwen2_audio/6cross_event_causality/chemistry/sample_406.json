    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 1: The diagrams and narration that define a compound and explain the Law of Multiple Proportions and the Law of Definite Proportions, with mass-ratio visuals for CO and CO2. These slides provided the foundational understanding of atomic composition and the concepts related to mole ratios, which are essential for computing the molar mass of CO2 and other similar compounds.",

    "model_answer": "The events that most directly led to the explanation provided in the \"Atomic Radius and Ions\" segment were:\n\nA: Event 8: The \"Atomic Radius\" segment that defines atomic radius as an average bonding radius and connects it to bond length determination while showing the periodic table labeled for radius.\nB: Event 9: The periodic-trends segment that visually marks \"Bond Radius Increases Down a Column\" and \"Bond Radius Decreases Across a Row,\" with narration about principal quantum number and effective nuclear charge.\n\nThese events established the foundational knowledge needed to understand how atomic radii are determined based on the number of electrons and their distribution within an atom. This understanding is crucial for explaining the behavior of ions, which have different numbers of electrons than neutral atoms.",

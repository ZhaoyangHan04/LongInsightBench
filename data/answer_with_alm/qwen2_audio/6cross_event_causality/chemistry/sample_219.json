    "model_answer": "The events that most directly caused the clogging/gelation leading to the failure of gravitational filtration were:\n\nA: Event 2 — Acid addition to the sodium silicate solution produces a gel (silicic acid) and visible foaming/mixing, after which dilution is needed.\nB: Event 6 — Injecting hydrochloric acid into the bottle triggers intense bubbling/foam and formation of a “solid polymer,” making the mixture difficult to filter by gravity.\n\nThese two events occurred earlier in the process and contributed to the development of a thick, possibly gelled mixture that was not easily filtered by gravity.",

    "model_answer": "The losses most likely occurred during step C: Event 8 — Repeated washing, splitting the mixture into bottles, siphoning with a PVC tube, and rinsing until clear phases appear. This step involves manipulating the solid-liquid mixture, which could lead to the loss of some product.",

    "model_answer": "Option B: Event 10: The speaker discusses water stewardship, sewage as a water polluter, and the development of primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment, while a plant schematic shows stages like chlorination and a coal sand filter. This event emphasizes the importance of treating wastewater to remove pollutants before it is discharged into the environment, which motivates the inclusion of disinfection and filtration steps in the municipal water treatment process.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 5: The electrolytes slide visually depicts NaCl dissociating into Na+ and Cl− surrounded by water; the speaker explains hydration and that dissolved ions conduct electricity, giving the mechanistic basis for solubility. \n\nIn this event, the speaker provides a visual demonstration of the dissociation of NaCl into Na+ and Cl− in water. This process involves hydration, which is the interaction of water molecules with positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions. The resulting hydrated ions are highly soluble in water due to strong electrostatic forces between the charged particles and water molecules. Additionally, the fact that dissolved ions can conduct electricity indicates that they are well分散 throughout the solvent, further enhancing their solubility. These concepts form the foundation for understanding why ionic compounds are generally soluble in water.",

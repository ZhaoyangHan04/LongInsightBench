    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are A, B, C, D. All four events provided foundational knowledge necessary to understand the final result in event 9. Event 8 explained the concept of exothermic reactions and their numerical representation. Event 3 reinforced this concept through visual aids. Event 4 established the baseline knowledge of methane as an example of an exothermic reaction. Event 7 linked these previous events together by introducing stoichiometry and its relation to energy changes.",

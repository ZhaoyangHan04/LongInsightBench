    "model_answer": "The events that most directly set up or caused the metaphorical result sub-event in event 12 are A: Event 11 and C: Event 7.\nEvent 11 introduces the idea of introspection and the spider web, which lays the foundation for the subsequent comparison of the alchemist's work to that of a spider. Event 7 reinforces the idea of nature being simple and self-contained, which aligns with the concept of the alchemist creating their own reality from their own thoughts and ideas. These early events establish the themes and concepts that are used to develop the spider metaphor in event 12.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Event 3 — Continued discourse on seeds, metals, life, and union over “METAMORPHOSIS PLANETARVM” imagery and joined figures in a vase, deepening the metamorphosis/union theme the treatise promises to address. This event likely led to the focus on the concept of growth and transformation, which is central to the title page of the alchemical text mentioned in the question. The other events may have contributed to the overall thematic development, but they are not as directly linked to the specific focus on the title page.",

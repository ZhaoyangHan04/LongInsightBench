    "model_answer": "The answer is (A) and (C). Option (A) is correct because the speaker defines covalent bonds in terms of sharing valence electrons, which is the topic covered in event 1. This definition is written on the board during event 1, which directly causes the subsequent classification of covalent bonds. Option (C) is also correct because it refers to the discussion of electron transfer and the distinction between ionic and covalent bonds, which takes place in event 5 and is written on the board during event 5. This information is relevant to the subsequent classification of covalent and ionic bonds. Options (B) and (D) are not directly related to the classification of covalent and ionic bonds.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A/B/C/D. All four events provided the necessary conventions and concepts that directly led to the usage of parentheses and subscripts in writing formulas for compounds like calcium hydroxide. Event 9 introduced the concept of subscripts to indicate原子数目, which is crucial for writing formulas correctly. Event 2 explained the different types of covalent bonds and their corresponding electron sharing patterns, which is essential for understanding the composition of compounds. Event 10 demonstrated the use of subscripts to represent multiple atoms in a molecule, which is also applicable to compound formulas. Event 4 defined ions and explained ionic bonds, providing a broader context for understanding the structure of compounds.",

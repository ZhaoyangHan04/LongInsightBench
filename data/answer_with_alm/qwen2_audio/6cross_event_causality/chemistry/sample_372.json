    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Event 3: Demonstrations show acids turn blue litmus red and bases turn red litmus blue, with narration concluding litmus helps identify acids or bases—providing the baseline to eliminate those when no change is observed.\nThis event demonstrates the basic color-changing properties of litmus, which is essential knowledge needed to understand the context of the question and the available options. It sets the foundation for understanding that litmus is used to determine whether a substance is an acid or base by changing its color. This prior event makes it clear what the expected outcome should be when adding litmus to a neutral solution, hence explaining the lack of color change observed in event 9.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 3: Demonstrations and narration establish the rule that acids turn blue litmus red and that red litmus remains red in acid (while bases turn red litmus blue). This prior event provides the necessary context for understanding why the blue litmus turned red in response to the lemon juice.\n\nThe other options do not directly relate to the observed outcome:\n\nA: Visuals of lemons with the caption “Acids taste Sour” only emphasize the general concept that acids have a sour taste, which is tangibly different from the sour taste of lemon juice. It does not specifically explain why the blue litmus turned red.\n\nC: Event 1 discusses the properties of litmus as a dye but does not specify how it reacts to different substances like lemon juice.\n\nD: Event 6 involves guessing the color of litmus in neutral solutions, which is unrelated to the specific observation of the blue litmus turning red in lemon juice.",

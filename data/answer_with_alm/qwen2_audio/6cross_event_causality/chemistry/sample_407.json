    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 6: Prior explanation that molecular equations differ from net ionic equations and that spectators are excluded (audio), while presenting an example at the board (video).\n\nThis event explains the difference between molecular equations and net ionic equations, which is crucial for understanding how to write balanced chemical equations. This knowledge is necessary for writing the equation that spans nearly the entire board by including all the ions. The example presented on the board also helps to reinforce this concept.",

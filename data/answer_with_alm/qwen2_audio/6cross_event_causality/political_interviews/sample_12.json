    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Event 0: The host asks how he’d handle current geopolitical developments; the guest proposes ending the Russia–Ukraine war to distance Putin from Xi, while visuals show an urgent Fox News Alert, a regional map marking Moscow/Voronezh/Rostov-on-Don, and footage from Rostov-on-Don about Wagner mercenaries. This event sets the stage for the discussion of Russia's capabilities and potential actions towards Western Europe, which leads to the guest's proposal to deter China from going after Taiwan.\n\nThe urgency in the Fox News alert and the geographical locations mentioned (Russia, Ukraine, and China) suggest a tense situation that impacts global politics. The reference to Wagner mercenaries in Rostov-on-Don indicates a military presence in the region, which could be relevant to China's potential actions.\n\nTherefore, option A best explains how the preceding events led to the guest's argument about deterrence against China.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible events leading to the guest's stance were A: Event 6 and C: Event 7. The discussion in Event 6 about the RNC pledge requirement and the direct question about his support for Trump or DeSantis likely prompted the guest to emphasize the importance of having a clear stance. Additionally, the on-screen chyron in Event 7 mentioning DeSantis' refusal to commit to supporting Trump as the nominee could have further influenced the guest's perspective on the importance of transparency and open debate in political campaigns.",

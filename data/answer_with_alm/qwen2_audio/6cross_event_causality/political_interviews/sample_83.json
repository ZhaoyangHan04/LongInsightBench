    "model_answer": "The exchanges most directly setting up the question in Event 12 are:\n\n  * Event 9: The interviewer raises Western concerns about increased aggression and specifically cites alleged interference in the U.S. election (e.g., DNC hacking), prompting the woman to demand specifics.\n  * Event 10: The interviewer cites Robert Mueller’s 37-page indictment naming 13 Russians, while the woman dismisses it as “just names,” pushing for concrete actions and evidence.\n  * Event 11: The interviewer describes meeting a young woman at the Internet Research Agency who spread fake news, provoking the woman to react strongly and ask for the name, treating it as a crime.\n\nThese events build the context around the topic of Russian interference in American politics and the debate over what constitutes evidence and action against it.",

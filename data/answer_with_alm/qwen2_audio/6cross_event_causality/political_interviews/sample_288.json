    "model_answer": "The direct setup for the interviewer's question about defense message difficulties in South Carolina was established by Event 0 (visual + audio), which highlighted South Carolina as a critical state in the 2012 GOP race and noted Ron Paul's significant surge there. This context made it likely that the interviewer would ask about how Paul plans to address defense concerns in South Carolina, especially given his strong stance on military spending cuts and budget balances.",

    "model_answer": "The events leading up to the final wrap-up in Event 11 were mainly shaped by Events 8 and 9. In Event 8, the host criticized the Fed's meeting minutes for missing the housing/financial meltdown, which laid the groundwork for a discussion about the Fed's failures. In Event 9, the host asked why the Fed misses so much despite having many PhDs, and Paul replied that they follow the wrong ideas, mentioning Greenspan and a state of total denial, which aligns with the headline shown later. These discussions set the stage for Paul's call for change in Event 11. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Event 9.",

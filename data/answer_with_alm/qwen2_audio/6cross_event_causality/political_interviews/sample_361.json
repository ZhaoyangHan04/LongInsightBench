    "model_answer": "The answer should be based on the events leading up to the current situation discussed in the speech. \n\nWe know from Event 3 that there is a 'blocking minority' in the Council that opposes the fund and there is no support for increasing the budget. This implies that the current 2.5 billion euro budget is insufficient to address the needs of the most vulnerable citizens across the European Union. Therefore, we can infer that the need for a larger budget was already established before Event 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: Event 3: The speaker outlines that a Council \"-blocking minority\" opposes the fund and there is no support for increasing the budget.",

The discussion about making the fund more predictable and channeling aid through organizations likely responds to the criticism that the previous fund was not effective. This suggests that events leading to this change were driven by dissatisfaction with the previous fund's performance, which could have been due to various factors including inefficiencies in distribution and lack of coordination among different stakeholders. Therefore, we cannot pinpoint a single event as the direct cause of these changes.\n\nAnswer: Unable to answer",

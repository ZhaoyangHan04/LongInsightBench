    "model_answer": "Based on the information provided in the audio, it seems that option B, Event 3, played a significant role in pushing the IAEA to press Japan for better information. In this event, the anchor raises concerns about the honesty of TEPCO and the fact that the IAEA may not have all the facts. This suggests that the IAEA was aware of the situation and its severity but lacked sufficient information to take appropriate action. It is possible that the anchor's questions prompted the IAEA to seek more information from Japan, resulting in the improved flow of information mentioned later on.",

    "model_answer": "Option C: Event 2: Reports stress global implications, including elevated radiation, a poll showing disapproval, and trace amounts detected as far as Sweden and the US, alongside Greenpeace measuring high levels.\nThe IAEA Director General's call for international support likely came as a response to the growing concerns raised by the global community about the severity and potential long-term impacts of the nuclear disaster in Japan. The reports from events 2, 4, and 5 highlighted the scale of the crisis and its potential reach beyond Japan, leading to increased pressure on the IAEA to play a larger role in coordinating international efforts to address the situation.",

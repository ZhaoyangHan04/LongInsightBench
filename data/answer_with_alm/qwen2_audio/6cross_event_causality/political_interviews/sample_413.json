    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 5 â€” MRCC Rome orders the Iuventa to stop ongoing rescues and transfer five minors to Lampedusa despite multiple boats visible on the horizon calling for help. This decision by the MRCC to stop the rescue operation and transfer individuals to Lampedusa effectively ended the Iuvenata's involvement in the rescue efforts, leaving them unable to assist the other distressed boats in the area. The other events listed may have contributed to the situation, but they were not the direct cause of the Iuvenata being removed from the rescue area.",

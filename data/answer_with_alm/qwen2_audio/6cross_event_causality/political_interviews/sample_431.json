This is because the conversation on immigration had been ongoing throughout the previous events, with several questions related to immigration policy and the experiences of immigrants being discussed. As the interview came to a close, it made sense that the guest would thank the interviewer and the interviewer would express gratitude, signifying the end of the immigration discussion.",

    "model_answer": "The preceding sub-event that most plausibly drove the emphasis on moving away from single-use plastics and building up recycling platforms is option A: A build-up within the environment/plastics thread. This is because the conversation around environmental issues, particularly plastic waste, has gained significant momentum in recent years. The mention of important events such as the passage of bills to phase out single-use plastics and the urgency of addressing climate change and plastic disposal issues aligns with the growing awareness and concern for the environment and sustainability. Additionally, the use of the bookshelf background in the video suggests a setting that promotes knowledge and learning, further emphasizing the importance of education in addressing these pressing issues.",

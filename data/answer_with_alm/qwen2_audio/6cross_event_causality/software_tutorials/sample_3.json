This action would lead to the user being prompted to submit the request, which is then confirmed in Event 5. \n\nEvent 3 provides context about the purpose of temporary removals, which is to hide content from Google search results for a period of time (six months). This information could be relevant when the user clicks “Submit request” in Event 4, as they may have removed content for temporary reasons related to the information provided in Event 3.",

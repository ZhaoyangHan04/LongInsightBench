    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 6. In event 6, on-screen text asks \"#2 Should I worry about External/Other traffic hurting my performance on Home or Watch Next?\" while the speaker explains creators fear external traffic lowers AVD and harms Home/Watch Next. This directly led to the introduction of the new module that filters CTR and AVD specifically for Home and Suggested to reduce concerns about external sources.",

    "model_answer": "I would select events 3 and 4 as contributing moments to the product direction. Event 3 highlights metric confusion and the importance of considering other metrics like average view duration (AVD). Event 4 builds upon this by discussing CTR in relation to impressions and how a new feature aims to help creators understand their performance better. These discussions likely prompted the speaker to address common metrics used in YouTube analytics and the need for a more comprehensive understanding of performance.",

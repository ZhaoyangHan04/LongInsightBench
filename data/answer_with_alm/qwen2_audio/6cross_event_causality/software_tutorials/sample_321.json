    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B/C: Event 4: Pasting the disable-UPnP code under the connection tag in shared.xml in Notepad, saving the file, and restarting Skype as instructed; Event 6: In Skype’s Connection options, entering a five-digit port that does not start with six and selecting HTTPS for proxy, as the speaker instructs.\n\nThese two events directly relate to the successful login by addressing issues with the UPnP and firewall settings respectively. Disabling UPnP and specifying a non-zero port number in the Skype connection settings allowed the connection to be made through the firewall and successfully logged into Skype.",

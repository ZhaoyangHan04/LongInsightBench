    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 11: Successfully starting the first engine after pre-oiling and then bringing avionics online, establishing a stable power and operating baseline. This event directly enabled the transition to ship power and charging by ensuring that the first engine was running smoothly and could provide power to the system. The other events provided necessary preparations, but they were not directly responsible for enabling the transition to ship power and charging.",

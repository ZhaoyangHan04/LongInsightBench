    "model_answer": "The answer is D: Event 0: Introduces the problem and mentions a one-line CSS solution, followed by a short musical jingle. \n\nThis event introduces the issue of anchor links on a page causing problems when navigating to different sections, which leads the presenter to consider solutions. He mentions that a one-line CSS solution exists, which suggests that he was considering CSS as a potential solution before deciding to use JavaScript. The subsequent events build upon this initial introduction, with Event 3 discussing the use of CSS and custom properties, and Event 5 mentioning the issue with using magic numbers in CSS. However, it is clear that these events did not directly lead to the implementation of the final solution, which involved JavaScript.",

This is the initial introduction to the concept of clips and how they work. It sets the stage for what the audience can expect to see in the following events.\n\nEvent 4: The presenter uses the Share Clip option, shows the share pop-up and URL copying, and states they will show how clip viewing works next. This event demonstrates the practical aspect of creating and sharing clips, which leads to the creation of a looped clip-view result.\n\nTherefore, the steps leading to the looped clip-view result were: (1) Introduction to clips in Event 2, (2) Creation of a clip in Event 4, and (3) Sharing the clip in Event 4, which resulted in the looped view on the watch page.",

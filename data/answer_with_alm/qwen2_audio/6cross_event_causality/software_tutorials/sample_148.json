    "model_answer": "The answer must relate to modifying system settings to enhance performance. Events 5 and 6 both involve adjusting system settings, with Event 5 focusing on visual settings and Event 6 on disk optimization. However, these events do not directly affect UI responsiveness. Event 10 only mentions opening the Registry Editor, which could be used to modify settings but does not specify what those settings might be. Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: Event 5, as it involves setting system-wide performance options with a focus on UI responsiveness.",

This confirms that the upcoming segment will focus on the Search Console Sitemaps report, further setting up the topic.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) and (C).",

They were then prompted to view the report's status and possibly noticed an error message. This eventually led them to inspect the error details. Therefore, events B and C could have contributed to the user's action of opening the sitemap and reviewing its status. Option D does not seem directly related to the user's actions in this scenario.",

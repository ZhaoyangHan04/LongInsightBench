    "model_answer": "The most direct step that enabled the smooth lift-and-return of the slide under the airgun test was likely option B: expanding/seating the diaphragm fully, aligning the spring locator and raised dowels, and verifying free up–down movement before closing the cap (Event 5). This step ensured that the diaphragm was properly seated and密封, which is crucial for maintaining the pressure differential necessary for the slide to lift and return smoothly.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 5: Ensuring the diaphragm is seated all the way around and aligning the spring locator and raised dowels before placing the cap. \n\nBy ensuring that the diaphragm is fully seated and aligned, the presenter has created a strong mechanical seal that should prevent leaks when the cap is installed. Additionally, aligning the spring locator and raised dowels ensures that the cap is securely attached to the needle and will not come loose under pressure. These steps were crucial for building a stable and reliable system that can withstand the pressure of the carburetor.",

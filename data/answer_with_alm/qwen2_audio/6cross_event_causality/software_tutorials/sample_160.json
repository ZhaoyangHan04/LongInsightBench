    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Event 2: She trimmed the clips to the beginning of the chosen sound to synchronize the segments before editing in Video Star.\n\nThis step was necessary because the audio needed to be synchronized with the video. By trimming the clips to the beginning of the chosen sound, she ensured that the audio would play at the correct time in the final video. This synchronization is crucial for creating a seamless transition between the audio and visual elements of the video.",

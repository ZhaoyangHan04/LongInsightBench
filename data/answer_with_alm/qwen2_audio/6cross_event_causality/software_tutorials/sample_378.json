    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Launching Tor and connecting via the Vidalia Control Panel, then opening the Tor Browser to the Tor check page, as shown when it begins connecting and loads check.torproject.org. This event directly enables the narrator to access Craigslist using Tor and obtain a unique IP address through the anonymity provided by Tor. The subsequent viewing of the Craigslist directory in the standard browser session (non-Tor) and seeing the Tor \"Congratulations. Your browser is configured to use Tor\" page do not directly enable accessing Craigslist with a unique IP address. Similarly, subscribing to blocklists and blocking IPs using PeerBlock may help protect privacy, but it does not directly enable accessing Craigslist with a unique IP address.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Starting and connecting to Tor via Vidalia and loading the Tor check page to verify the Tor Browser is active. This event likely led to the narrator's awareness of Tor's incognito features and the need to clear history and cookies for enhanced privacy. It also possibly introduced the concept of usingTor with other tools like PeerBlock and Freenet for added security.",

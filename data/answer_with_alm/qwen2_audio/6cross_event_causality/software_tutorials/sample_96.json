    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: Event 2: He uses Expand Appearance and then Pathfinder > Merge so the line art paths are unified.\n\nThis action in Event 2 creates a selection of the entire line art, including any fill colors or gradients, making it possible to expand the selection to include the background fill as well. This expanded selection is then used with Pathfinder > Merge to combine all the individual path elements into a single, unified shape. The golden yellow fill color is applied after this step, but it does not directly set up the ability to merge the base color with the line art.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Event 8: He selects one eye, holds Shift to select the other, and then changes their color in the color controls.\n\nExplanation: In the provided audio and visual aids, it's evident that the character's eyes turn red after selecting them and changing their color using the color controls. This process is described in detail starting from Event 8, where the user selects one eye, holds down the Shift key to select the other, and then changes the colors of both eyes simultaneously in the color controls. Therefore, this step directly led to the character's eyes turning red.",

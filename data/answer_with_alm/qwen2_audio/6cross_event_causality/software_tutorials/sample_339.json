Without this step, the old phone would not be able to access the new device's storage, and thus could not complete the file transfer.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 3: Selecting transfer categories that include “Bilder” and “Audio, Video und Dokumente,” along with relevant apps, totaling 9.67GB.\n\nThis action involves choosing which files to transfer from the old device to the new device during the initial setup process of the transfer. By selecting these specific categories and their corresponding apps, the user ensures that the photos and music will be transferred to the new device. The other events may contribute indirectly to the appearance of the photos and music on the new device, but they are not direct causes of the transfer.",

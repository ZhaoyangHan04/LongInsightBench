    "model_answer": "The correct answer(s) are B and C. Option A describes the necessary steps to configure ReShade before using it, but does not mention the visual transformation itself. Option D discusses reverting settings and exploring different effects, which is related to using ReShade but does not describe the visual transformation either. Option B installs ReShade and selects effect packages, which allows the game to recognize and use the injected shaders. Option C moves the preset .ini file to the correct location so that ReShade can find and list it in the in-game menu, making the preset usable within the game. Together, these two events directly led to the visual transformation observed in event 9.",

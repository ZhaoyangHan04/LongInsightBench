This is because creating the bots involves specifying their functionality, which includes favoriting tweets and replying to misspellings, as well as setting up the scheduling for when they should run.

Once the keys and tokens were generated, they could be pasted into the bot form on the left side of the screen (Event 5) and the bot could be configured to send direct messages (Event 8). However, without creating the application first, it would have been impossible to obtain the necessary keys and tokens.",

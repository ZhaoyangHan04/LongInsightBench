    "model_answer": "The most plausible factors driving the change in microphone placement were likely events 2 and 4. Event 2 discussed the issues with wind noise and the recommendation to mitigate it, implying that the current positioning might not be optimal. Event 4 highlighted the loud engine noise, which could interfere with the microphone's performance. These events likely led to the decision to relocate the microphone to a more protected and quieter area, such as the jacket pocket.",

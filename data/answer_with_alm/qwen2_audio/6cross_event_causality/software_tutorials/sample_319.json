    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Event 5: Dragging out the initial button (the “OK” button) to begin customizing, providing the base control that was later templated into a style resource.\nThis event is responsible for creating the initial button that serves as the basis for the style resource. By right-clicking the button and selecting Edit Template → Edit a Copy, we can modify the template to add rounded corners, change the background, and create a reusable style resource. This process is only possible because we have an existing button to work with.",

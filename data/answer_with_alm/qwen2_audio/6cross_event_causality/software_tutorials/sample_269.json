    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A, B, C, D.\nExplanation: The changes made in events 3, 8, 9, and 6 have all contributed to the appearance of the document as described. Event 3 caused the first page header to differ from later pages, event 8 added automatic page numbers to the header area, event 9 typed the running head and title in all caps and aligned the page number, and event 6 adjusted the paragraph spacing and indentation. The absence of the \"Running head\" text in the headers on later pages indicates that these events were executed correctly.",

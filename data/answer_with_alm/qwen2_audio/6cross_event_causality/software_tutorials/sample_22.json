The UI update would not have been possible without these underlying events being implemented first.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A, B, C. These events are the primary enablers of the successful loading of toys with their original positions and orientations when the game is loaded. Event 11 involves implementing serialization surrogates for Vector3 and Quaternion using the BinaryFormatter and configuring it with a SurrogateSelector to use these surrogates. Event 10 involves designing a serializable ToyData class with fields for toy type, ID, and position/rotation data. Event 9 identifies that the BinaryFormatter cannot serialize Unity classes out of the box, necessitating a surrogate-based approach. Event 7 involves creating a user interface for players to work/buy items and update their currency and toy count.",

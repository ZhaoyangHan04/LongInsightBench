    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Opening LiveSplit earlier by double-clicking LiveSplit.exe so the timer window exists to capture (event 1).\n\nThis step creates the initial LiveSplit window that will later be used as the source for the OBS overlay. By opening LiveSplit before creating the OBS scene, the timer window is already available when needed to add it as a source in OBS. The other options may affect the appearance of the timer in OBS, but they do not directly enable the transparent overlay to be shown.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible action that made saving necessary before event 9 was option B: Editing the layout by adding icons/components and customizing the timer display (event 4). This could have involved making changes to the layout that were not automatically saved, prompting the need to save the layout manually.",

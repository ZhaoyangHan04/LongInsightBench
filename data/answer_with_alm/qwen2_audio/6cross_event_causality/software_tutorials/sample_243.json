    "model_answer": "The most plausible causes of the transition into the Chorus section in event 5 are events 3 and 4 as they both relate to the preparation of the Chorus section. Event 3 covers the verse with counting and display of lyrics, setting the stage for the Chorus. Event 4 announces the Pre-Chorus and displays its chord progression, which is necessary for understanding the structure of the song and anticipating the Chorus. Event 0 provides an overview of the song structure but does not directly cause the transition to the Chorus. Event 2 does not seem to be related to the Chorus section at all.",

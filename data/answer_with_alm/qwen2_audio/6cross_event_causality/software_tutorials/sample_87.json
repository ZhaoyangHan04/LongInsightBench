    "model_answer": "The sub-events that most likely led to the need for explicit SQL result set mapping were A: Event 7 – “WRITING QUERIES”, where the speaker discussed selecting specific columns from a database; C: Event 1 – “MAPPING ENTITIES”, where the relationship between entities and their corresponding database tables was mapped; and D: Event 2 – “ENTITY RELATIONSHIPS”, which explained different fetch types for relationships in entities. These events provided context for understanding data management and querying needs, which prompted the introduction of the @SqlResultSetMapping annotation and mapping diagram in Event 9.",

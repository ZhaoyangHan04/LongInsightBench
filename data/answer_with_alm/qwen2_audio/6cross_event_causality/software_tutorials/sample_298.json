    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 9: Download and install the OBS VirtualCam plugin and the VB-CABLE virtual audio driver, then restart to load the drivers.\n\nThis step is necessary because it allows OBS to recognize the virtual camera and audio devices created by Zoom. Without these drivers installed, OBS will not be able to use them as sources for the presentation. Once the drivers are installed and loaded, the presenter can select the \"OBS Camera\" option in Zoom's settings, which will use the virtual camera as the primary video source. The \"Cable Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)\" option can then be used for the microphone, allowing the audio from the meeting to be routed through the virtual audio cable.",

    "model_answer": "The answer must address the need for clear audio during the Zoom call and potential solutions for that issue. Events 1 and 3 both highlight problems with audio quality, which has led to the recommendation of using wireless earbuds for better monitoring. Option A directly states the need for clear audio during the Zoom call, while option C mentions the problems caused by laptop speakers, which could also affect the audio quality of the call. Option D does not seem to be directly related to the audio quality of the call. Therefore, the answer should be A, B, and C.",

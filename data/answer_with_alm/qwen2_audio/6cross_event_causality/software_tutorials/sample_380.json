    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Installing Kodi onto the USB drive by selecting it as the destination during setup and completing the installer (events 0â€“2).\n\nThis is because installing Kodi onto the USB drive creates a new profile folder within the USB drive's Kodi directory, which is where the portable_data folder is subsequently created. The other options may affect the contents or structure of the folder, but they do not directly cause its creation.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Installing Kodi onto the USB drive and completing the setup process so Kodi can run from the USB.\nInstalling Kodi on the USB drive allows it to be run from the device, which is necessary for the customized build/content to appear within Kodi. Once installed, completing the setup process will ensure that Kodi is configured to use the USB drive as its primary storage location for add-ons and settings. This is the step that makes the customized build/content visible within Kodi from the USB-based setup.",

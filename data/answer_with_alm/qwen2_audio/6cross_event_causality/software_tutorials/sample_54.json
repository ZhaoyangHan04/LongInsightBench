    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Event 10: Completing the two-peak Gaussian fit and obtaining FWHM values for the two peaks. This step involved selecting multiple peaks using the Multiple Peak Fit tool in NLFit, fitting them with a Gaussian function, and calculating the full width at half maximum (FWHM) for each peak. The FWHM values are used to determine the width of the peaks, which are then displayed in the final graph as \"Fit Peak 1\" and \"Fit Peak 2\".",

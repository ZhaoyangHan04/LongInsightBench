    "model_answer": "The most plausible earlier points leading to the conclusion about .mp4's capabilities are A and C. The opening montage showing various devices and the narrator discussing the importance of choosing the right container for playback suggest the context of video files and their compatibility across different platforms. Additionally, the subsequent discussion on container formats and playback issues further emphasizes the significance of selecting the appropriate container for optimal playback. Therefore, A and C both contribute to the understanding of the capabilities of .mp4 files as a suitable format for playback on different devices.",

However, the direct relationship to the red 'X' and the advice to avoid MPEG-2 might be found in Event 13, where it is stated that unless necessary for DVD delivery, H.264 is the recommended codec for current distribution. Therefore, the answer would be D: Event 13 sub-event.",

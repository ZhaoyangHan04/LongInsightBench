    "model_answer": "The answer must have occurred before event 13, as it directly led to the system approaching 10 degrees of subcooling. Of the above choices, only event 12 directly relates to adjusting the refrigerant charge, which would lead to subcooling. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Opening the suction side to let about two pounds of refrigerant in, waiting 5-10 minutes to equalize, and dialing in subcool to the manufacturer's recommendation while watching temperatures/pressures (event 12).",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Adding refrigerant in measured increments, allowing the system to stabilize, and dialing in the subcool to the manufacturerâ€™s recommendation while monitoring gauges (event 12).\n\nThis step is crucial as it ensures that the air conditioner has the appropriate amount of refrigerant to function correctly. Testing the system after adding refrigerant allows the presenter to verify that the system is stable and that the refrigerant levels are within the recommended range. This helps to prevent overcharging or undercharging, which can cause problems with the air conditioner's efficiency and longevity. Additionally, monitoring the gauges during this process helps the presenter to ensure that the system is operating within safe limits.",

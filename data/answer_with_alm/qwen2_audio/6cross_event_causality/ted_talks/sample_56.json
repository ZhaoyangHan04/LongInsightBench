    "model_answer": "The answer is C: Event 7 (audio, preceding the image). In his speech, the speaker mentions using the three Ts approach in presentations and then mockingly describes what an inexperienced presenter might bring on a first date, which includes a bouquet of roses, a heart-shaped box of chocolates, and a card. This sets up the visual of the same items appearing on the screen, which is a direct reference to the speaker's previous comments about presenting.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is likely B: Event 11 (audio, just before the image). Since the DVD cover appears on the right side of the frame, it suggests that the visual was intentionally placed there during editing. The context provided in the audio indicates that the speaker is discussing the importance of structure in storytelling and how this relates to the popular TV show MythBusters. Therefore, it is plausible that the image was chosen because it is related to mythbusting and fits within the theme of the preceding events.",

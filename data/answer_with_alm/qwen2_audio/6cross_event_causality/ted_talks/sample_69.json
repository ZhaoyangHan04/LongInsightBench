    "model_answer": "The events that most directly led to Manu inventing the Foldscope were [Event 3] as a child building his own microscope from eyeglasses and [Event 9] observing in India that a microscope was only used by one person, highlighting access and cost barriers. These experiences sparked his interest in making microscopes more accessible and affordable. Option A mentions his hands-on experience with experimentation, which may have contributed to his interest in science and innovation, but it is not the direct cause of the invention of the Foldscope. Option B talks about sharing opportunities and dedication to accessibility, which is important for Manu's mission, but again, it is not the direct cause of the invention. Option D discusses a technical aspect of biology research, which may be relevant to Manu's work, but it does not relate to the development of the Foldscope.",

    "model_answer": "I would select B and C as they are most directly related to Manu's advocacy for a phone-enabled, crowdsourced approach to mosquito surveillance. Event 8 seems to be more focused on the technical aspects of monitoring, while events 6 and 9 are more general and do not specifically relate to mosquito surveillance.",

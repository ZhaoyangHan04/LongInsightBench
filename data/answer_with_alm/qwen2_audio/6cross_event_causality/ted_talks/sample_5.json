This is because Bek's suggestion that these two modalities work together synergistically seems to be the catalyst that led Michael to explore and eventually benefit from floating. The other options do not seem directly related to Michael's adoption of floating as a treatment for his insomnia, night sweats, and night terrors.",

This event provided evidence of the therapeutic benefits of floating and cannabis, which resonated with the float tank operators and prompted them to advocate for veterans to benefit from these treatments.",

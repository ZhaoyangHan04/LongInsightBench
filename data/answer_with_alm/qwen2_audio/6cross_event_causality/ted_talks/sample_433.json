This aligns with later events where the speaker discusses the impact of these power dynamics on marginalized groups within the tech industry.",

This moment sets the stage for the critical pivot by introducing the idea that open source, which has grown beyond software, can be applied to various fields and become a tool for creating a different cultural norm. This aligns with the subsequent discussion of toxic norms and the importance of examining the culture created by those in power.",

This led him to test sawdust in a beaker with water and oil to see if it would work for removing oil effluents. This experimentation eventually led to his discovery that about 95% of oil effluents could be removed using this method. Therefore, event 4 played a crucial role in the speaker's conclusion about the effectiveness of sawdust for cleaning oil pollutants.",

    "model_answer": "The most plausible answer is B: A sequence of concrete, humorous campaign examples—cat café ‘ex’s name in the litter,’ a laundry’s Western video, a nonprofit’s ‘boobs and balls’ motif, a Gulag soup recipe reward, and a duck-chasing name-read video—presented on stage to a live audience (events 3, 5, 6, 7). These examples likely engaged and entertained the audience, making them want to clap after the talk ended. Option A may have set up the topic, but it's less directly related to the audience's applause. Option C only mentions the speaker's job and doesn't indicate any specific moment leading to the applause. Option D mentions the calming piano music, which may follow the talk, but it doesn't explain why the audience applauded.",

These events helped shape the speaker's perspective on the role of humor in crowdfunding campaigns and contributed to her conclusion that life is crowd-based and that the way outside the topic borders should be lined with a smile.",

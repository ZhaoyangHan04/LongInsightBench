    "model_answer": "The answer is likely A and C. The audio indicates that Daryl's decision to hang up his white robe and destroy his robes was influenced by his decades-long engagement with the KKK and his support for their freedom of speech (option B). This suggests that events such as Event 2 played a significant role in shaping Daryl's views and actions. Additionally, the public figure's declaration that the discourse was over may have contributed to the sense of finality and closure that led to Daryl's decision to destroy his robes (option C). Option D, violent street clashes, does not seem to be a direct cause of Daryl's actions, although it may have contributed to the broader context in which he made his decision. Option E, personal growth and self-reflection, also seems to be a possible factor but less directly linked to the specific events described in the audio.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is: A: Event 12: Daryl personally drove the daughters to visit their father in federal prison—something “nobody in the Klan had ever done for them”—a concrete act of support.\n\nThis event directly contributed to the change in the family's views because it showed them that there are people who care about them and are willing to take action to support them, despite the family's past affiliation with the KKK. This personal experience likely led the family to reconsider their beliefs and values, leading them to distance themselves from the KKK and express support for Martin Luther King Jr.'s celebration.",

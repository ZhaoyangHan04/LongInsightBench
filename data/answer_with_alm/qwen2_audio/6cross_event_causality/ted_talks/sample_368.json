    "model_answer": "The events that most directly built the evidentiary case for gender justice were likely B and C, as they both highlighted significant problems related to gender equality and women's rights in Calgary. The slide and narration in Event 1 provided context about Calgary's ranking, but it did not build a strong case on its own.

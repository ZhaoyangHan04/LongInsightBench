This event likely sparked an interest in the property and its potential, which eventually led to the decision to open the restaurant.\n\nB: Being shown the “dusty, dank, deserted” space by lantern, meeting the Feltons, falling in love with the space and deciding to go for it (Event 2). This event was life-changing for Jenn and her husband, as it led them to discover their dream location and pursue their passion for food and hospitality.\n\nC: Writing a business plan, securing money from the bank, and starting renovations while finishing the school year and prepping their home to sell (Event 3). These events were necessary steps towards turning the abandoned bistro into a successful restaurant, but they were not the direct cause of the opening date.\n\nD: Learning to handle the small-town rumor mill and grow a thicker skin once already running a public business (Event 5). While this event may have helped the couple navigate challenges and criticism,",

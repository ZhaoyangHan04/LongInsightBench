This connection between character development and data organization aligns with the content presented in event 6.",

This aligns with the subsequent mention of creating a character sheet that fuses traditional Buddhist criteria with modern science, which seems to be a response to the need for a more comprehensive understanding of individuals mentioned in Event 9.",

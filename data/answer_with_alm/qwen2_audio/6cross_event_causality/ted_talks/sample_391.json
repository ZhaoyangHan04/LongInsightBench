    "model_answer": "A: Event 5 — The speaker recounts a family lineage of beekeepers spanning four generations and growing up around that culture. B: Event 8 — The principle that installations at Mildred’s Lane are living systems you can inhabit, accompanied by visuals of the book “The Grafter’s Shack” and “The Life of the Bee.” C: Event 2 — The plan to build an art site/art park (not a commune/retreat), emphasizing working and making site-specific projects. D: Event 10 — It’s winter now with fewer people, and Mildred’s Lane becomes a school in summertime with topical sessions.\n\nAnswer: A, B, C, D\nExplanation: All these events are connected to the theme of bees and beekeeping, which is central to the Grafter's Shack installation. Option A provides context about the speaker's upbringing and connection to beekeeping, option B emphasizes the interactive nature of the installation, option C highlights the art aspect of the project, and option D mentions the seasonal use of Mildred's Lane. Therefore, all these events are likely to have contributed to the creation of the bee-focused installation.",

Option C, the speaker's formal training, does not seem to be directly related to the development of communal gathering spaces.",

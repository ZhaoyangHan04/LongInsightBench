    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 3 â€” The account of a 9th-grade algebra class moving from roughly the 20th to the 99th percentile when teachers empowered student ownership with Khan Academy (classroom visuals; audio describing percentile gains and applause).\n\nThis event is most likely the primary contributing factor that led to the partnership announcement between Khan Academy and College Board because it showcases the immediate and significant impact that Khan Academy's platform can have on students' academic performance, particularly in mathematics. The fact that the class improved from the 20th to the 99th percentile in just one year indicates a high level of effectiveness and potential for equity in education. This success story aligns well with Khan Academy's mission to provide free, world-class education to anyone with an internet connection, which is also highlighted in their partnership with College Board.",

This event showcases the young man's success and dedication to learning, which sets the stage for his future achievements and fit with Khan Academy's mission. The other events also contribute to the outcome, but they are not as directly connected to the initial introduction of the young man on stage.",

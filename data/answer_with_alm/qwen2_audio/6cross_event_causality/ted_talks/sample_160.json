    "model_answer": "The events that most plausibly underpin and directly lead to the software-centric vision are:\n\nA: Event 3: On “Lowering Barriers To Space Access,” the speaker introduces software-defined satellites for Galactic Sky (2019) and says users will program satellites “like you would a cellphone with apps.” This event highlights the potential for software to transform the satellite industry by making it more accessible and user-friendly.\n\nB: Event 1: The “A New Space Race Is Here” and “Microsatellite Disruption” framing with audio explaining that modern satellites are smaller, cheaper, and faster to develop due to a new entrepreneurial generation. This event sets the context for the shift towards smaller, more affordable satellites, which opens up opportunities for software-based innovation.\n\nC: Event 2: The detailed comparison slide quantifying micro satellites’ 20 kg average mass, 0.1–1M USD cost, and <1 year development time, reinforcing the feasibility of rapid, lower-cost (software-like) cycles. This event provides specific data on the capabilities of modern satellites, which is relevant to the development of software-defined satellites.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A, B, and C.",

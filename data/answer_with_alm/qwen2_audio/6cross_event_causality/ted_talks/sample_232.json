    "model_answer": "The events that primarily enabled the business growth were B: Starting a daily sketch practice around 2009 to hone her craft as an illustrator and C: Launching “Boodadoodles” from that practice, sharing it online, and it going viral. These events provided the foundation for her skills and popularity, which led to the successful online gift shop and large community around Buddha Doodles. Option A, signing with a publisher and announcing a book for pre-order, happened after the initial success of Boodadoodles, but was not the primary enabler of the business growth. Option D, touring with self-published books at comic conventions and directly connecting with her audience, also helped build her following but was not the main driver of the business growth.",

    "model_answer": "The events that most likely caused and set up the speaker's call to bold action were:\n\nA) Event 3: Emphasizing that humor helps students learn by easing fear of mistakes and noting seventh-graders’ willingness to take risks, with a brain diagram slide reinforcing the learning theme. This event seems to have influenced the speaker's belief in the importance of taking risks and embracing humor, which aligns with her later call to action.\n\nB) Event 9: Pivoting to “So what can we take away from this as adults?” while the visuals shift to a historical, adventurous sepia image of people pulling sleds, foreshadows the call to adventurous risk-taking. This event may have inspired the speaker to reflect on the risks and adventures she has taken (or missed out on) in her own life, and how those experiences could inform her message about taking risks.\n\nC) Event 1: Describing internet advice about avoiding embarrassment in seventh grade, with stage visuals like a locker room and clock, implying avoidance as a strategy. While this event does not directly relate to the call to action, it suggests that the speaker is concerned about the pressures and fears associated with adolescence, which could resonate with her audience and reinforce her message about embracing vulnerability and taking risks",

    "model_answer": "Answer: C: Ayahuasca described as communicating in a visible language (like glyphs) and mention of glossolalia, paired with vivid symbolic visuals (Five Elements diagram, crop circles).\n\nThe concept of telepathy being switched into a language where people can \"see what you mean\" is similar to the idea of communication through symbols and visual language. Ayahuasca is known for its ability to induce visions and alter perception, which could lead to the creation of new forms of communication. The use of symbols, such as the Five Elements diagram and crop circles, along with glossolalia (spontaneous verbalizations), supports the idea of using language in a non-traditional way to convey meaning. This aligns with Event 4's critique of language biases and the emphasis on seeing beyond words.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is B: Event 10: Questions posed about “what is voice” and what self-generated sound can do to one’s own organism, amid visuals of a robed group facing light and a radiant sage-like figure. This segment discusses the concept of voice and its relationship to the body, which lays the foundation for the idea that sound can have a profound impact on the body. The following events build upon this theme by exploring the use of sound in various contexts, leading to the conclusion that ayahuasca shamans are skilled in using sound to control the body.",

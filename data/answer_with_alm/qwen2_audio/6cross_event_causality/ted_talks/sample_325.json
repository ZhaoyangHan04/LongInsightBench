    "model_answer": "The events that most directly set up the rousing final call and audience applause are:\n\nA) Event 14: The speaker urges using the process to solve bigger problems, inviting people to join Team WikiSpeed and contribute a few hours to social good. This sets the stage for the idea of solving big problems through collaborative efforts, which aligns with the final call and audience applause.\n\nB) Event 15: The speaker explains volunteers spend 2-8 hours per week achieving regular successes—building ultra-efficient cars and tackling issues like rotavirus and distributed banking. While this provides context for the work that WikiSpeed does, it does not directly set up the final call or audience applause.\n\nC) Event 13: The speaker establishes credibility by noting 100+ volunteers across eight countries and that they sell cars now. This provides evidence of the success of WikiSpeed's efforts, but it does not directly set up the final call or audience applause.\n\nD) Event 1: A slide on “AGILE: NEW SOFTWARE TEAMS” and seven-day cycles explains rapid iteration basics. While this provides background information on agile methodologies, it does not directly set up the final call or audience applause.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

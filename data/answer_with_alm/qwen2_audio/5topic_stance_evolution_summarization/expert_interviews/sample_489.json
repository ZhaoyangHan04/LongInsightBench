    "model_answer": "The speaker's stance evolves from emphasizing the importance of open source as a way for companies to get involved and contribute, to focusing on the concept of freedom and participation as the key driver behind the success of free software. This shift is evident in the change in the visual representation of the software model, from initially comparing open source to proprietary software, to后来强调自由软件将赢得未来。 The speaker also acknowledges the importance of education and the potential benefits of using free software in schools, further highlighting the evolution of his perspective. Therefore, the correct answer would be A: He first contrasts free software with open source, calling open source a set of compromises to reassure companies, while the screen itself frames that exact comparison. He then pivots to freedoms and participation as the real spark, and later the visual title shifts to “Free Software vs. proprietary software” as he asserts free software will win and is not merely “free beer.” He closes by applying this to education, saying the free software platform is richer and will prevail in schools.",

    "model_answer": "The speaker's plan for bringing free software to users develops across several segments. Initially, he reflects on the importance of choosing the right words (free software vs open source) and the need to consider the broader semantic opinion underlying them. This leads him to identify two camps - the open-source camp and the Debian camp.\n\nIn the open-source camp, the speaker explains that initially, he thought about taking free software to the desktop and finding the smartest approach. He then realizes that narrowing Debian down would be counterproductive since it has a universal mission. Therefore, he creates a new branch under the Debian umbrella by identifying aligned people via mailing lists.\n\nLater, the speaker acknowledges that Debian excels in certain areas while Ubuntu excels in others. He also recognizes that there are complementary strengths between the two projects. Therefore, instead of creating a separate branch, he suggests that Debian could continue to evolve and grow within its existing umbrella, while Ubuntu could complement it by focusing on different areas.\n\nTherefore, option A best describes the speaker's plan for bringing free software to users across these segments.",

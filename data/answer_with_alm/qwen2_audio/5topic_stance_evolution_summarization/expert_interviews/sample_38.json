Rebecca then urges new adjusters to invest (e.g., $10 per claim and proper equipment), warning they only get one chance, as an inspection form appears on-screen. Later she emphasizes balance, mentorship, and asking what you don’t know, and finally elevates networking by spotlighting the NACA convention’s multi-firm interviews as its president.\n\nRebecca Wheeling provides comprehensive guidance on professional growth for independent adjusters across the conversation. She starts by highlighting the importance of investing in oneself, including purchasing necessary equipment and ensuring a good work-life balance.

Overall, her guidance covers various aspects of professional development, making option A the correct answer.",

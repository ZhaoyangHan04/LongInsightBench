    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: He begins by recalling the 1970s programmer community that shared software and its later destruction, with Italian subtitles mirroring that message as he gestures in a cluttered office. He then rejects a proprietary life and carefully defines the core freedoms of free software while the translated captions reinforce each point. Next he states that in 1983 he announced a plan to build a free operating system, as later visuals spotlight GPL “superhero” icons and the term GNU/Linux. He finally expands to a global perspective, describing six-continent collaboration and local service-oriented business models that challenge megacorporations, highlighted by titles like “La Globalizzazione.”\n\nExplanation: The speaker starts by recounting his personal experience in a programmer community where they shared software, which was considered a good way of life. However, this community was destroyed, and the speaker had to face the challenge of using proprietary software that they were not allowed to share or change. This led him to reject a proprietary life and embrace the idea of free software, which allows individuals to share and modify their software without restrictions. As the talk progresses, the speaker expands on the concept of free software, discussing its global implications and the importance of collaboration across continents. He also highlights the success",

    "model_answer": "A: He first explains why software patents endanger developers and differ from copyright, warning that one can be sued even for writing or using a program. He then cites Microsoft-specific examples—patenting basic ideas in .NET and a new file format used to pressure cross-licensing—before revealing that a European directive text was authored by the Business Software Alliance, discovered via hidden Word metadata. He concludes by contrasting Europe’s advantage without software patents and expressing hope that the US will abandon its harmful approach.\n\nThe speaker starts by explaining the negative aspects of software patents, how they can endanger developers and differ from copyright, which allows for free use and distribution of creative works. He then uses Microsoft as an example to illustrate how software patents can lead to proprietary practices, such as patenting basic ideas and using them to pressure cross-licensing. This is followed by the revelation that a European directive text was authored by the Business Software Alliance, which shows how corporations can influence policy-making. Finally, the speaker contrasts Europe's advantage of not having software patents with the potential harm caused by software patents in the US and expresses hope for change in the US approach.",

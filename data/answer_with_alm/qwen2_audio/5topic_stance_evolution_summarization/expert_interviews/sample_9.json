    "model_answer": "The speaker's focus evolves from a personal choice of items to a discussion of competitive accolades and mathematical analysis. This is evident as the conversation starts with him choosing three items, including a Kai'Sa statue, which has a personal connection to his girlfriend. As the interview progresses, the statue becomes less important, and the calculator becomes a prominent symbol of his analytical approach to the game. By the end of the interview, the focus shifts even further away from personal items and towards the importance of mathematics in the game. Therefore, the correct answer would be A: The segment opens by framing the task with on-screen text about selecting three items (event 0). It then uses the Kai’Sa statue to tie his personal life and showmanship to competition, as he explains hovering a champion for his girlfriend and caring about entertainment (event 7). Finally, the calculator becomes a visual cue for his analytical side, paired with his explanation that simple numbers drive outcomes in-game (events 10–11). The progression moves from framed personal meaning and performance to concrete, numbers-based decision making.",

    "model_answer": "The speaker's professional philosophy evolves from a focus on winning and outsmarting opponents to prioritizing entertainment and education. Initially, the speaker was focused on becoming a very popular player and being high and mighty compared to those who did more background work. However, over time, he realized that people enjoyed watching what he did, which is the only difference between him and other people. He also started to make sure that everyone knows that he stands on the same ground as other people. In addition, the speaker has now shifted his focus to public coaching and growing an academy ecosystem to raise player understanding. This shows a shift from purely focusing on strategy and performance to also considering the impact on the audience and community. Therefore, option A best describes the speaker's evolution from his early approach to his later goals.",

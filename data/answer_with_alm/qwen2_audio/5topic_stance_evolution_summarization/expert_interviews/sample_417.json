    "model_answer": "The interviewee's stance on originality and authorship evolves from initially rejecting it in favor of creativity to acknowledging its value while also discussing the complexities of defining and preventing plagiarism through context shifts. He starts by condemning copying and sampling but then expands his views by distinguishing between different forms of appropriation and explaining how these strategies can be used ethically within writing. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be A.",

    "model_answer": "A: After an on-screen prompt raises the audience issue, he says the audience is now unknowable and inattentive in a somber tone. He then reframes this as neither good nor bad—just the way things move fast—and chooses not to complain, instead adapting personally. A later prompt about daily online routine precedes his embrace of constant connectivity and externalized memory, saying everything is archived and he can search his memories.\nThe interviewee initially views the audience negatively but then recognizes the inevitability of constant connectivity and externalized memory. He decides to adapt to these changes rather than complaining about them. His response suggests that he has come to accept the reality of the situation and is looking for ways to make the best of it.\nOption B is incorrect because the interviewee does not criticize the audience for being focused; rather, he sees it as a negative aspect of the current state of affairs. Option C is also incorrect because the interviewee does address the audience prompt and even uses it as a starting point for a larger discussion about technology and memory. Option D is incorrect because the interviewee does not see the audience as clear or easily targeted, and he actually encourages artists to resist short-form content.",

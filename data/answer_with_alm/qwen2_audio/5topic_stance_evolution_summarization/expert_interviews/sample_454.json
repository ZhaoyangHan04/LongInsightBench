    "model_answer": "A: He first articulates the goal of an action game with commandable NPC allies, acknowledging the risk of genre-mashing while gameplay UI shows tactical objectives. He then recalls prototyping a control-transfer mechanism in a demo, later recognizing similar “hot swapping” elsewhere, with on-screen documents highlighting control-transfer ideas. Finally, he reflects on stylistic influences like Metal Slug and admits the cartoony look may have been unfashionable at the time, yet he personally values the art style.\nThis option provides the most coherent and comprehensive overview of Tancred Dyke-Wells’ design philosophy evolution throughout the interview. It accurately captures his initial vision for creating an action game with both player-controlled characters and non-player character allies, his experimentation with different control schemes, and his eventual decision to embrace a more realistic art style based on market feedback.",

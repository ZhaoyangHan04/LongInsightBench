    "model_answer": "The guest's viewpoint follows a pattern of initially showing interest in Libra as a novel and potentially innovative project, while expressing reservations about Bitcoin's centralization and lack of transparency. However, over time, the guest becomes increasingly skeptical of Libra, especially after the segment highlighting concerns about Facebook's influence over the project. By the end of the conversation, the guest seems to have shifted their focus back to Bitcoin, stating their belief that it has a better chance of becoming a successful, decentralized currency. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be A: He begins by endorsing Libraâ€™s centralized oversight as a strength and suggests it is already more proven than Bitcoin. He then argues that Bitcoin still needs more testing before being trusted widely. Finally, he says he prefers tokens that are controlled by a company because that ensures accountability.",

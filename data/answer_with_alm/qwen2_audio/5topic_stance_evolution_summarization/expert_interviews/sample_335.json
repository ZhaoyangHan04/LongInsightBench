    "model_answer": "The answer is A: He opens by introducing Dbrain as a human-in-the-loop platform on blockchain, then repeatedly stresses that data is the core of AI, not raw compute. He clarifies misconceptions by calling AI a pattern recognizer fed by human-generated data, and distances himself from the buzzword of “merging” AI with blockchain. He then frames blockchain as infrastructure for a trusted data marketplace that can include the unbanked and protect datasets. He concludes by forecasting AI’s growing role in routine cognitive tasks.\n\nDmitry starts by emphasizing the importance of data and computation power in driving AI, but as the conversation progresses, he becomes increasingly focused on the potential of blockchain to create a trusted data marketplace. He also emphasizes the role of human oversight in AI systems and predicts that AI will play an increasing role in routine cognitive tasks in the future.",

Dmitry starts with industrial and medical use cases like meat-factory tracking, pizza quality control, cancer detection, and photo retouching. When asked for consumer angles, he highlights face recognition on new phones and camera noise reduction, then expands to self-driving and implications for surveillance, and returns to healthcare with pathology assistance. He closes by projecting AI’s takeover of routine cognitive tasks across domains.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

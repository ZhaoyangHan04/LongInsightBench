    "model_answer": "A: She begins by framing SETI as a search for technosignatures, using a biosignature analogy as shown by molecular graphics, then justifies the radio focus as cost-effective and transmissible while SKAO imagery appears. Next, she specifies narrowband, drifting signals with a frequency-chart visual, warns about human-made RFI that contaminates data, and reframes the goal as detecting RFI from space that repeats. She concludes that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, advocating repeated detections and coordination among multiple radio telescopes.",

    "model_answer": "A: She recalls hearing about SKA as a student and calls it the best scientific instrument, with on-screen text noting “about 14 years” and a globe animation underscoring collaboration. She then moves into concrete leadership roles in 2022–2023 and shows construction progress, before broadening to SETI’s funding reality via private donors like Breakthrough Listen (shown in graphics), and finally addresses investment debates, conceding skepticism but arguing the public’s deep interest and the need to keep searching despite a tiny searched fraction. This arc ties personal enthusiasm and institutional progress to pragmatic funding and a principled case for continued SETI.\n\nThe audio indicates that Dr. Ng starts by expressing her enthusiasm for the SKA project when she was a student. Over time, she becomes more involved in the project and eventually takes on leadership roles. She also recognizes the importance of private funding and mentions the Breakthrough Listen initiative as an example of this. Additionally, she addresses investment debates and acknowledges skepticism, but still argues for the importance of continuing SETI research due to the public's interest and the need to keep searching for extraterrestrial life. Overall, her stance progresses from being enthusiastic about the SKA to a more pragmatic approach to funding and the search for",

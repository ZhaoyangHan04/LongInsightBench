    "model_answer": "The interviewee appears to have a nuanced stance on private contractors in intelligence and government spending priorities. Initially, he praises private contractors for their efficiency and nonprofit status, indicating a belief that they outperform government agencies. However, as the conversation progresses, his views evolve to become more critical of private contractors' access to secrets and the government's claims of limited resources.\nHe starts by situating mass surveillance inside a contractor-dominated system, naming firms and budgets, which suggests that he sees private contractors playing a significant role in the national security establishment. This perspective shifts when he condemned private access to secrets as absurd and “smelling of fascism,” and challenges claims of scarcity by contrasting them with the capacity to monitor everyone.\nFinally, he skewers defense-first spending like submarines and ABMs over public needs, implying that investing in these projects may be prioritizing military interests over other pressing issues such as civil services or infrastructure. Overall, it seems that the interviewee's stance evolves from a positive view of private contractors to a more critical view of their influence on government spending priorities.",

    "model_answer": "The interviewee's advice to potential whistleblowers evolves from a resigned tone suggesting that global surveillance cannot be changed and advising silence to avoid retaliation, to a more active stance encouraging them to follow in Snowden's footsteps and leak information provided they take necessary precautions such as maintaining anonymity and avoiding informants. This change in tone is evident through the evolution of his facial expressions and the interaction with the crowd in the visual aids provided. The audio also reveals his belief that while泄露 information might have consequences, it is still worth it for the greater good of protecting others and promoting truth.",

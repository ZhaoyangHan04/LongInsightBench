    "model_answer": "The evolution of the interviewee's guidance to students about effective public service occurs from foundational principles to practical collaboration advice through several stages. Initially, he lays out core traits such as integrity, hard work, discipline, and teamwork (option A). This is presented through a close-up shot of him speaking, which adds a sense of intimacy and focus on his message. Later, when discussing the role of technology in public service, he emphasizes the importance of technology-first skills (option B). However, as the interview progresses, he reiterates the importance of having a strong moral compass and maintaining friendships with elected officials, even after contentious debates (option A). This shift in perspective highlights the practical application of ethical principles in public service and the value of collaboration across different roles and political affiliations.",

    "model_answer": "The conversation shifts from an ethical decision to broader reflections on political change and respect for public servants when the interviewer asks for an example of how the president's moral compass has guided his actions. This leads to the president explaining his decision to pardon Nixon for the national interest. As the conversation continues, it broadens to reflect on the president's experiences in Congress and the presidency, and the interviewer asks for advice for Ford school students. The president shares his views on the skills that made him an effective public servant in Congress and the presidency, and the conversation ends with the interviewer expressing concern about the current state of respect for public servants and the president acknowledging the concern.",

    "model_answer": "A: They reflect on a very busy 2018 of gigs but shift toward studio focus, noting that stage appearances will be rarer. Later they say there will be only a few live surprises this year, yet they emphasize bringing extras and planning each show individually. Their animated gestures and consistent backstage setting reinforce a selective but highly committed approach to making each appearance special.\n\nAnswer: Across events 1, 2, 13, 15, and 16, the band's stance on live activity and show planning evolves from being quite busy and focused on stage appearances (events 1-3) to prioritizing studio work and limiting live appearances (event 13). However, they express a commitment to still bring some surprises in their shows and plan each event individually to make them special (events 15-16). This indicates a selectivity in their approach to live activity while maintaining a strong commitment to their craft.",

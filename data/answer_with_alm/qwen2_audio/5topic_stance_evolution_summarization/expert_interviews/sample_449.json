    "model_answer": "The speaker's viewpoint evolves from initially stating that music is constantly evolving to acknowledging that while music is changing, it is also experiencing a decline in live performance quality. This shift is evident through his use of personal anecdotes and visual cues such as the return to the red-lit setting. However, the speaker also acknowledges that personal experiences may not necessarily reflect broader trends in music evolution.

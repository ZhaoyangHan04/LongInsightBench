    "model_answer": "The audio clip provides insight into Hannah's evolving views on effective native advertising and audience trust. Initially, she defines good native advertising as a mix of the publisher's and brand's voices, reflecting the publisher's look and feel. However, as the conversation progresses, she caution against shoehorning brand messages and emphasizes the importance of being transparent about sponsored content. This shift in perspective is evident when she mentions the Netflix partnership and the changes in Mashable's visual aesthetic to label it as partner content. Later sections of the clip emphasize the importance of being upfront on-site and on social media, repeating the message that they create content, not commercials. Finally, she stresses the importance of transparency to maintain audience trust. Therefore, option A best captures Hannah's viewpoint on effective native advertising and audience trust across the segments provided.",

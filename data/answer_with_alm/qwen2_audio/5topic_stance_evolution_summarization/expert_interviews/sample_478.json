    "model_answer": "The answer is A: After declaring the 2017 token sale a success and emphasizing strict AML/KYC that led to rejecting a significant portion of funds, the team shifted to user access with an OTC launch featuring 0% fees. They organized the rollout in phases and kept the banking application and exchange as separate tracks due to regulatory needs, with a plan to progress toward more open trading. This sequence balanced compliance first, then accessibility and staged expansion.\n\nThis option best summarizes how CASHAA's strategy evolved from the sale through the initial product rollout. The team initially focused on the success of the token sale and emphasized strict AML/KYC measures. However, they soon realized that they needed to prioritize user access and convenience, which led them to organize an OTC launch featuring 0% fees. This was followed by a phased rollout of the banking application and exchange as separate tracks due to regulatory needs. The team had a plan to eventually progress towards more open trading while ensuring compliance and user protection.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: They recognized that many users were hesitant to use public exchanges and preferred buying directly for legitimacy, so they launched an OTC with zero fees to simplify access. From there, they planned phased expansion—first OTC, then full buy/sell, and eventually peer-to-peer—while pursuing regulatory approvals in the background. This approach aimed to build confidence and reduce barriers for newcomers.\nExplanation: The audio mentions that CASHAA's stance on user access evolved from launching an OTC with zero fees to simplify access, to a phased exchange strategy with plans to expand first to OTC, then to full buy/sell, and eventually to peer-to-peer trading. This approach was intended to build confidence and reduce barriers for newcomers. The audio also notes that CASHAA pursued regulatory approvals in the background, which suggests that they were planning ahead and taking steps to ensure compliance with regulations.",

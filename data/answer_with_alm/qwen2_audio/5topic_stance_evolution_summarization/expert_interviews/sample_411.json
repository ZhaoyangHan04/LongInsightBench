    "model_answer": "A: He begins by saying the choice wasn’t strategic and grew from his existing animal-rights work and meeting ex-industry people. With an on-screen prompt asking about the film’s title, he explains “maximum tolerated dose” both as a toxicity test and a metaphor for human and non-human breaking points. As further title cards ask why he addressed the topic, he calls it a winnable issue, then clarifies that animals aren’t responsible for human diseases while acknowledging past progress and urging tech-enabled, non-harmful alternatives.\nThe speaker starts by stating that making the maximum tolerable dose was not a well thought-out or highly constructed strategic decision. However, as the on-screen prompts and monitor text reveal more about his thought process, we see that he became interested in the subject while already making animal rights documentaries. He wanted to make a bigger contribution and had made some shorter films but hadn't done a feature-length one yet. The on-screen prompts also show that he has always been inspired by films like Earth. This indicates that his initial decision to tackle the subject was driven by personal interest and desire to make a difference rather than a well-planned strategic decision.",

    "model_answer": "The speaker starts by discussing the impact of the film, mentioning that researchers reached out to him and some people even left the industry due to its content. This indicates that the speaker has already thought about the film's impact beyond just creating it. However, when prompted about the film's visual and sonic qualities, the speaker affirms his activist identity and emphasizes the importance of aesthetics and coherence in documentaries, stating that they are essential despite the subject matter being disturbing. This shows that the speaker values style and coherence in filmmaking.\nThe speaker then goes on to describe a new AR/intersectionality project that he is working on with Dr. Lauren Gorman. He also mentions that the film can be ordered or downloaded, indicating that he is taking steps to distribute the film. This shows that the speaker is interested in promoting the film and making it accessible to a wider audience.\nTherefore, option A best fits the speaker's discussion as it accurately captures the evolution of their thoughts from the film's impact to their stance on style/activism and future directions/distribution.",

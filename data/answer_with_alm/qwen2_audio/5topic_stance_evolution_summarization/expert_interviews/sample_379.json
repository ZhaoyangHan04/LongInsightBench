    "model_answer": "The conversation starts with a critical view on relying on imported content and moves towards embracing local stories. This shift is evident through the dialogue about the importance of telling regional stories and the government's efforts to build a creative sector. However, when censorship concerns are introduced, the tone changes to defensive and the conversation concludes on a positive note about government initiatives. The visual elements such as the use of a star-branded backdrop and close-ups also contribute to this progression.

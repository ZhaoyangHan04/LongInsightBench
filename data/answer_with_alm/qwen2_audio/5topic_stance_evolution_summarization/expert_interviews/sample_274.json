The presentation also includes demonstrations of the fencing configuration and methods provided by Hadoop to solve the split brain problem. Finally, the video concludes with a summary of the solutions provided by Hadoop to tackle split brain scenarios. Therefore, the correct answer would be A.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: He frames split brain as dangerous, using a bullet slide and verbal examples of metadata corruption (events 1–3). He places this in historical context, showing that Hadoop 2’s HA architecture addresses single points of failure, then advocates configuring fencing with visible code snippets and example methods (events 4, 7–8). The tone shifts from cautionary to prescriptive as he moves from problem to concrete enforcement mechanisms.",

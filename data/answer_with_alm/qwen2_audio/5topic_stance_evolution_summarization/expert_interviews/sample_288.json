Visually, this arc runs from the AE911Truth title card and her lab-like computer display with scientific captions to emphatic gestures, French subtitles about demolition and evidence removal, and a sharp, punctuating sound as she stresses openness. Her voice moves from calm, instructional explanations of method to firm, critical accusations that the investigation was unscientific and even illegal.\n\nThroughout the audio, Margolis starts by establishing her credentials as a scientist and her expertise in genetics.

By the end, he accepts the prevalence figures for long COVID in children and treats the ONS numbers as decisive. His tone shifts from confidence to agreement as new evidence appears.\n\nThe male speaker initially emphasizes the importance of eliminating the virus completely, referencing examples from other countries. However, as the conversation progresses and new data becomes available, his stance evolves. For instance, when discussing school safety, he initially supports strong mitigation measures but eventually calls for hospital admission figures to assess the effectiveness of these measures. Similarly, when it comes to the prevalence of long COVID in children, he initially expresses skepticism but ultimately accepts the ONS figures as conclusive. This shift in tone suggests that he becomes more open-minded and willing to consider different perspectives as new evidence emerges.",

    "model_answer": "A: She starts by rejecting a deaths-only framing, stressing long COVID and favoring elimination over a vaccination-only herd immunity approach. She then pushes for school mitigations like masks, filtration, and CO2 monitors, and later cites ONS figures (e.g., 1 in 8/1 in 7 and 12â€“15%) while listing persistent symptoms in children. Her message grows from caution about unknown long-term harms to concrete policy measures backed by displayed statistics.",

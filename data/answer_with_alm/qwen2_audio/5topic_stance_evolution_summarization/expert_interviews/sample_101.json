    "model_answer": "The future of Facebook Open Foresight project collected web interviews with thirty of the world's leading tech thinkers across categories spanning society. These experts' perspectives shift on Facebook's commercial trajectory and strategic responses to competition and fatigue. Some see Facebook as a centralized hub that needs to expand into the offline world to stay relevant, while others believe it should focus on creating new value and revenue through blended online and real-world experiences. There are those who predict that Facebook will be replaced by the next big thing or by alternative social media platforms, while still others maintain that Facebook is unchallenged and should avoid integrating with other companies. Overall, the opinions are diverse and reflect the complex and constantly evolving nature of the tech industry and Facebook's position within it.",

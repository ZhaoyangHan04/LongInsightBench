    "model_answer": "The answer is A: He begins by stressing impartial leadership and strategy over favoritism, speaking calmly while gesturing to the interviewer (event 9). He then reframes the question toward team-building, explaining you must find players’ strengths, sometimes push them, and set ego aside (events 11–12). Next he emphasizes clear communication and adjusting niches when needed (event 13). He concludes by warning that unresolved synergy issues can fester into conflict, just as the visuals cut to a closing graphic, signaling the end of the segment (event 14).\n\nThroughout the interview, Puppey's stance on building and managing a top team evolves from a focus on impartiality and strategy to a more hands-on approach that involves finding players' strengths and setting ego aside. He also emphasizes the importance of clear communication and adjusting niches when necessary. Towards the end of the interview, he warns about the potential negative consequences of unresolved synergy issues. This evolution in his perspective is reflected in the changing visuals and the progression of events in the interview.",

    "model_answer": "The audio clip reveals a complex evolution in Puppey's views. Initially, he seems open to various creative paths such as music, singing in a choir, and even engineering devices. However, as the conversation progresses, his views shift towards a more pragmatic approach, emphasizing the importance of being the best in a particular field rather than pursuing creative passions or having a spark. By the end of the clip, it appears that he has fully embraced the idea of focusing on technical excellence over other considerations like art or music. Therefore, the best option to describe this progression would be A: He first says he’d likely be a musician or do something around that, speaking casually on the couch under the # YOUASK overlay (event 4). He then lists multiple instruments he plays and jokes about being a one-man band, gesturing as he speaks (event 5). He adds that he sang in a choir for years and was okay at physics and chemistry but prefers doing over abstract subjects (event 6). He culminates by valuing creating art and the idea or “spark” over being the best, while acknowledging he doesn't quite know what exact role he’d be in (event 7).",

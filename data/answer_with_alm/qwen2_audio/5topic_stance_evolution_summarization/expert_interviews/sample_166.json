The speaker also mentions the importance of data and calls it the 'oil' of the digital economy. Therefore, the answer should be A) He opens by situating the discussion within the “fourth industrial revolution,” with an on-screen prompt introducing the interview context, and urges the industry to embrace the transition.

As a new on-screen question about data appears, he pivots to continuous innovation and culminates by calling data the “oil” of the digital economy, the asset that powers insights and solutions.",

    "model_answer": "The speaker starts by discussing external collaborations such as partnering with Swift and regulators to improve the payment system and reduce friction. However, as the speech progresses, the focus shifts towards internal innovation. This is evident from the mention of cross-functional 'horizontals', the development of the Horizons app for global scale, and the creation of the D10X forum. The speaker also emphasizes the importance of increasing data accessibility. \n\nThe speech concludes with a confident assertion that the existing system will remain efficient, but this confidence is somewhat undermined by the closing Sibos title card, which implies that the system may not be able to keep up with competitors. Overall, option A best captures the evolution of the speaker's stance in the second half of the presentation.",

    "model_answer": "The interviewee's account of Bangladesh's digital journey develops as follows:\n\nIn the initial part of the discussion, he positions Bangladesh as a young, agro-based nation that missed out on earlier industrial revolutions. This sets the stage for the country's current digital transformation under his Prime Minister's leadership. As the conversation progresses, he frames the Fourth Industrial Revolution as both an opportunity and a challenge for Bangladesh. When the host mentions collaboration, the interviewee emphasizes that no one should be left behind as 5G connects the world. This highlights the importance of inclusivity and cooperation in the digital era.\n\nThe visual elements of the interview also contribute to this narrative. The WSIS-SDG Matrix backdrop provides a visual representation of the goals and objectives of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), which includes promoting inclusive access to information and communication technologies (ICTs). The use of close-ups of the interviewee's animated gestures further emphasizes his passion and enthusiasm for the topic.\n\nTherefore, option A best captures the development of the interviewee's account of Bangladesh's digital journey across the discussion, taking into account both the spoken narrative and the on-screen context.",

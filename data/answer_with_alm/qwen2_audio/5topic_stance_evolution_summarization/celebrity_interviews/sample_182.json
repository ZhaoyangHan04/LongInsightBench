    "model_answer": "A: She enters with surprise and excitement, encountering talk of a horse and the sight of Geoff the robot skeleton and other oddities. Later, she admits she’s taking it all in on her first show and notes they don’t have Jeff or a horse on her show, showing she’s acclimating. By the end, she leans into the playfulness by asking about the mouth organ, handling the harmonica, and joining the upbeat, dance-filled outro.\nThe audio clip indicates that Taylor Schilling's reaction to the quirky chaos of the show changes over time.

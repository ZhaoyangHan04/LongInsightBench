    "model_answer": "The guest's viewpoint evolves from open-minded and lenient to stricter and more cautious. Initially, he allows for free balling and seems fine with certain behaviors like sake spray, but as the conversation progresses and the topic becomes more serious, he becomes more hesitant and eventually draws clearer boundaries. For example, when the topic shifts to money and self-examination, he starts asking himself if he really wants to buy things and whether he has the money to do so, indicating a shift towards being more mindful of his spending habits. Additionally, when the topic turns to his past actions and how they may have impacted others, he expresses regret and a willingness to make amends, which suggests a greater level of introspection and self-awareness. Overall, the guest's stance becomes more defined and assertive as the conversation progresses.",

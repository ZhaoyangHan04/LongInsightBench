    "model_answer": "The male interviewee's stance towards mischief and stealing evolves from initially minimizing his actions as minor mischievous incidents to acknowledging them as stealing and apologizing for them later in the conversation. In the beginning, he seems to distance himself from outright wrongdoing, saying he relates to ambition but not stealing, while seated in the polished Descendants interview setup. However, as the conversation progresses and becomes more personal, he lightens the tone and admits to taking a watch from a set and having stolen as a kid (though not from stores), laughing as he shares the story with the kid reporters. This indicates that he may have been more willing to admit to smaller acts of mischief when he was younger. Additionally, his final statement about his classroom antics getting him sent outside suggests that he承认 some of his actions were considered disruptive or inappropriate at the time.\nTherefore, option A best describes the male interviewee's evolving stance towards mischief and stealing across the interview segments.",

Initially, she expresses enthusiasm and admiration for the performance, highlighting the fun and engaging nature of the event. However, as the interview progresses, she delves deeper into her character and personal experiences. She connects her character's journey of self-discovery and independence to her own upbringing, indicating a shift in focus from external validation to internal strength.

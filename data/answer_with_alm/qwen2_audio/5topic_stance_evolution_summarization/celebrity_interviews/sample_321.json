    "model_answer": "The correct answer would be A: The host first frames him as the singer chosen by Queen’s members and tied to Bohemian Rhapsody while the set cuts between The Cafe visuals and performance screens. He then recalls years of van touring before “the Queen thing,” eventually embracing the Mercury comparisons as the lower third labels him for The Ultimate Queen Celebration. The story moves through his viral audition and Ellen appearance to a wife-prompted leap despite band obligations. It culminates in him confirming his vocals are mixed into the film while the segment rolls concert footage and titling for his Queen celebration show.\nThis option best fits the sequence of events described in the audio and aligns with the details provided about Marc Martel's career narrative. The host starts by discussing Martel's connection to Queen and Bohemian Rhapsody, which is supported by visual elements on the screen. Then, the conversation shifts to Martel's past experiences, including his time on the road with his band and his initial拒绝 of offers from Queen. Finally, Martel confirms his involvement in the Queen biopic and discusses his upcoming tour. This option provides a coherent and chronological account of Martel's career development.",

    "model_answer": "B: He and the hosts underscore how Queen has been in the zeitgeist for decades and how ending with the anthems brings ovations. The visuals cut to branded performance material—The Ultimate Queen Celebration and a URL—while he says the show can fill two hours of hits and even include extras. They finish by trading favorites, with Don’t Stop Me Now singled out.\n\nThe host also notes that Brian May has curated the show's setlists around fan favorites and that it includes a mix of hit singles and deeper tracks. This indicates that despite his initial reservations about playing popular songs, Brian May has come around to embracing the demand for familiar tunes and is using the opportunity to showcase a variety of Queen's music, including both hits and lesser-known tracks.",

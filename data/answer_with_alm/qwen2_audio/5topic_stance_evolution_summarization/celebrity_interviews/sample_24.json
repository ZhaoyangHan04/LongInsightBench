    "model_answer": "The answer is A: The talk opens with on-screen mental health framing and a reflective tone, then moves into Maxwell’s personal story about being misperceived and the need to represent diversity, and culminates in a takeaway about accountability and how words matter. Visually, the \"ON MENTAL HEALTH\" and \"THERAPY SESSIONS\" titles set the stage, their animated gestures keep the exchange engaged, and the same couch-and-bokeh backdrop underscores a continuous, thoughtful arc.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Prompted by a weighty question, she recalls high points and past pressure, fearing a repeat but then finding the Troubadour night to be \"magic\" and one she’d relive. She ultimately reflects that younger Laura would be proud, noting life doesn’t go exactly as expected yet there’s beauty in the reality, all while speaking animatedly against the same couch-and-bokeh backdrop.\nIn the audio, Laura starts off by dismissing the question as a 'heavy' one, implying that it has made her think deeply about her past experiences. She then recounts a specific moment from her past, when she performed at The Roxy, which was a pivotal point in her career. This memory seems to bring her joy and excitement, and she reflects on how she would relive that night if she could. She also notes that life doesn't go according to plan and that there is beauty in the unexpected. Finally, she speaks animatedly against the background, indicating that she is passionate about her thoughts. Overall, this shows that Laura values her past experiences and the lessons she learned from them, and she believes that younger Laura would be proud of her achievements.",

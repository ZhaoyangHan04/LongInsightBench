    "model_answer": "The stance on authenticity and personal change evolves from a focus on social media metrics and self-worth to a more introspective and spiritual perspective. The initial segment discusses the idea of being real in a fake world and encourages people to pray on time, suggesting that spirituality can be a source of authenticity. However, as the video progresses, it becomes clear that this initial emphasis on spirituality is paired with a dismissal of traditional practices like prayer and instead promotes the use of alarm clocks as a tool for managing stress. This shift suggests a move away from a spiritual perspective towards a more practical approach to personal change. Additionally, the inclusion of interviews with celebrities like Salman Khan and the use of dramatic visuals like a TRAUMA graphic further emphasize the idea of personal transformation and the impact of external factors on this process. Ultimately, the video argues that authenticity is not just about being true to oneself but also about making meaningful changes in one's life and accepting the consequences of those changes.",

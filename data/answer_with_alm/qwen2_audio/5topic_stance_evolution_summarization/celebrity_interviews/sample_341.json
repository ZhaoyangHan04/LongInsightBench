    "model_answer": "The video starts by showing footage of XXXTentacion's donations and the positive response from the recipients, implying that his generosity was genuine. However, as the video progresses, the host becomes increasingly frustrated and critical of the media's coverage of X's actions. They argue that the donations were a PR stunt and that Complex, in particular, has been biased against him. By the end of the video, the host seems to be apologizing for previously defending X and acknowledging that their initial perception may have been wrong. Therefore, the video's stance evolves from a positive view of X's donations to a more critical perspective of the media's coverage and Complex's policies. Answer: A.",

    "model_answer": "The answer should be based on the progression of events across the video. We start with XXXTentacion addressing his fans and motivating them, which leads to him giving away an iPhone X and interacting with fans in a live stream. As the video progresses, we see him delivering motivational speeches and engaging with people in person, including offering support to a clothing brand. The video concludes with tributes to XXXTentacion on social media and an emotional reflection on his impact. Therefore, option A best describes the development of XXXTentacion's connection to fans and his motivational message across the video.",

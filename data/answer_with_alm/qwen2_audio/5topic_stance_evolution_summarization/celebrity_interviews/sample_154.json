    "model_answer": "The answer is A: It opens by noting Wendy Williams’s criticism while showing studio visuals, then juxtaposes Meghan’s vulnerable ITV clips and tabloid headlines. Midway, the Wendy studio segments turn openly dismissive of Meghan, mocking her on-air. Later, another commentator challenges Wendy’s lack of empathy amid SiriusXM visuals and closes with well-wishes for Meghan over ITV-branded footage, signaling a more sympathetic wrap. The overall arc moves from reported criticism to empathy and defense.\n\nThe initial segment shows Wendy Williams criticizing Meghan's behavior, which sets a critical tone for the rest of the program. However, as the program progresses, it becomes clear that the focus has shifted towards defending Meghan. This shift is evident in the change in tone when Wendy starts mocking Meghan on air and the subsequent commentary from other commentators. By the end of the program, there is a more sympathetic wrap-up, with well-wishes for Meghan being shown over ITV-branded footage. Overall, the program's stance towards Meghan develops from a critical perspective to one that is more sympathetic and supportive.",

    "model_answer": "The best summary of how the Megan Thee Stallion–makeup artist dispute progresses is option A: It starts with a credits spat shown via comment overlays between “akilaface” and “theestallion.” A bold slide insisting “All Artist Should Be Paid & Tagged” escalates the tension. Then, further overlays and selfies accompany narration that the artist also acknowledges frequent collaboration, softening the conflict. The segment ends with a conversational sign-off, implying no firm resolution but a cooler tone.\n\nThis option accurately captures the progression of the dispute from a public disagreement over credit and payment to a more conciliatory tone through collaboration and mutual acknowledgment of past work. The use of split-screens and Instagram receipts adds context and visual interest to the narrative, while the narrator's evolving commentary provides insight into the developments and underlying emotions driving the conflict.",

    "model_answer": "A: The segment opens by calling the choice “shocking” and “taboo” while showing the couple’s arrivals, then contrasts that with examples of black being acceptable elsewhere. It reframes the outfit as fashion-forward through a stylist’s praise before concluding that black was a considerate choice to deflect attention from the bride and groom and is acceptable at weddings.",

    "model_answer": "The video starts by discussing the fashion controversy surrounding Megan Markel's decision to wear a black gown to her friend's wedding instead of adhering to traditional wedding attire. As the conversation continues, it expands to cover other aspects of the event such as the venue, guests, and daily rental prices. The video also includes a detailed tour of the venue, with captions and narration. Additionally, there is a mention of the high cost of renting the venue, which adds to the discussion of the expenses associated with such events. The video concludes with typical channel call-to-action screens encouraging viewers to subscribe and like the channel. Therefore, option A best describes how the video develops from the fashion controversy to the broader coverage of the event and its presentation style.",

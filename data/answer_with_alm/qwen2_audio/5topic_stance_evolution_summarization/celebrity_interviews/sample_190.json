    "model_answer": "The answer is A: She opens with sharp satire about celebrity excess while being greeted by cheers, then mixes edgy charity jokes with a clear claim that she is “definitely into charity.” She later tosses off a mischievous quip about keeping a little of Madoff’s billions, but ultimately turns sincere, praising a colleague’s generosity and decency. Visually, she dominates the couch in a bright yellow jacket as the audience laughs, and the room’s energy softens when the panel leans in during her heartfelt tribute.\n\nThroughout the conversation, the guest's stance towards celebrity, money, and generosity evolves from satirical and self-promotional to more serious and sincere. She starts by making light-hearted comments about celebrity excess and even jokes about potentially keeping some of the proceeds from a Ponzi scheme, but as the conversation progresses, she becomes more serious and genuine. She praises a colleague's generosity and emphasizes the importance of supporting charitable causes, which shows a shift in her perspective. Additionally, her use of body language, such as dominating the couch and leaning into the panel during her heartfelt tribute, further emphasizes her sincerity and commitment to the cause.",

    "model_answer": "The conversation starts off by discussing a whirlwind marriage and how the couple coped with it through premarital counseling and ongoing therapy. As the interview progresses, the focus shifts towards the specific practices they use to manage their relationship, such as talking through jealousy and setting ground rules. Therefore, the evolution of the focus is from a general discussion of their relationship to concrete tools and practices they use to maintain it. Option A best describes this evolution.",

    "model_answer": "A: She reflects that being young around a touring pop star was a lot, then notes she’s now more mature and able to stand up for herself. From there, she describes building trust while naming jealousy as normal, adopting rules like not going to bed mad and playing fair, and learning to soften her tone and use 'it makes me feel' language because her style can come off loud next to her partner’s calm. The alternating two-location visuals and PRETTY BIG DEAL banner reinforce each step of that progression.",

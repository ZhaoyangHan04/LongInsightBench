    "model_answer": "The answer should be based on the evolution of the guest's narrative across the interview segment. \n\nInitially, the guest talks about her martial arts background and opening a school, highlighting her confidence and expertise. However, when the topic shifts to safety and social norms, the guest's perspective changes. She recounts a scary encounter with an ATM machine and expresses concern about being perceived as threatening, which prompts the host to emphasize the importance of respecting women's safety. This indicates that the guest's narrative evolves from自豪讲述自己的 martial arts skills to reflecting on societal perceptions of women's safety.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be A: She first proudly details her lifelong martial arts training, earning a black belt young and even opening a school, while the host admits finding it both intimidating and attractive. She then recounts a late-night ATM scare where people rushed toward her, prompting a defensive reaction. The host closes the loop by stressing you shouldn't run up to any woman at night because it’s terrifying, reinforcing a broader safety norm as both gesture emphatically.",

    "model_answer": "The conversation about Vikings develops by initially discussing the show's historical accuracy and consulting with a historian. This leads to a discussion about Lagertha, confirming her as a real shieldmaiden who fought alongside men. The conversation broadens to include other women warriors and their locations, with animated reactions and a visible desk globe. There is also a playful Ukrainian exchange highlighted by on-screen praise for her hair. The conversation then returns to Viking reach and navigation, but jokes that they were never in America. They touch on famous figures before running out of time. Therefore, option A is the closest answer.",

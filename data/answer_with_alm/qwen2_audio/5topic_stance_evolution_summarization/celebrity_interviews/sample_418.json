    "model_answer": "The squirrel topic starts with a playful language bit where the guest mentions loving squirrels and a mishap with their pronunciation, leading into animated gestures and audience laughter. It expands into jokes about buying nuts, adopting baby squirrels, and debating chipmunks versus squirrels, with a brief \"no more squirrel talk\" detour. However, the topic never fully ends, and the squirrel remains a running joke throughout the interview, even making a final callback in the outro with the host joking about a handkerchief being used to fend off a squirrel. Therefore, option B best describes how the squirrel topic evolves across the interview and into the closing segment.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: From the start, the host is unfazed and treats the guest as harmless, focusing on travel and languages. As the chat progresses, he grows more cautious, ending by calling her intimidating and cutting the talk short. The audienceâ€™s silence and stiff body language underscore the tension.\nThe host starts off by praising the guest's work in movies and TV shows, but as the conversation progresses, he becomes increasingly uncomfortable with the guest's behavior and attitude. He mentions how he was initially scared to meet her due to a violent role she played, and this discomfort is evident throughout the interview. Despite his attempts to steer the conversation towards more lighthearted topics, the tension between them builds, and eventually, the host calls the guest out on her intimidating behavior and ends the interview abruptly.",

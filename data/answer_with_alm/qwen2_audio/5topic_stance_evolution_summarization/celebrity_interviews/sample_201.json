    "model_answer": "A: He begins with a breaking-news headline and a wry, skeptical quip, then reads neutral reports about the protection order before condemning alleged grooming behaviors. As the visuals shift to split-screen news text and a Deadline article, his tone moves from bemused to exasperated, calling Warner Bros’ situation a no-win and floating the idea of replacing the star. He ends by showing comic imagery and criticizing DC’s choices, arguing a variant cover is inappropriate amid predator concerns.",

    "model_answer": "The speaker's stance shifts from legal allegations to wider industry criticism across the mid-to-late segments when he starts discussing the story beyond just the court protection order against Ezra Miller, mentioning another parent wanting court protection and Warner Bros' response. This indicates that he is broadening the scope of the issue to include the broader impact of Miller's actions on the film industry and the company's reputation. As the conversation progresses, he becomes increasingly frustrated with Warner Bros' handling of the situation and eventually turns his criticism towards DC Comics' variant cover. Therefore, option C, starting with neutral, text-overlaid reports, he pivots to red-carpet and MPAA preview visuals alongside the Deadline article, calling out behavior shifts from “odd” to predatory, best fits this description.",

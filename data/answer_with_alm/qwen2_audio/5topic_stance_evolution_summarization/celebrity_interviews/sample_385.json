    "model_answer": "A: The story opens by framing Mansonâ€™s home life as elusive and tied to a haunted residence before 2015, then tours an older Mediterranean home that looks weathered and in need of work, before shifting to the suburban place he bought after Columbine with its many amenities and eventual sale. It culminates with the reveal of a current haunted Hollywood Hills villa next to Johnny Depp, punctuated by an on-screen quote about buying it right before starting The Pale Emperor. Visuals reinforce each step: aerials, interior tours, map pins, and the quote card.",

This change in perspective is evident in her description of the property's condition and features, as well as in the visual elements used in the video.",

    "model_answer": "The video starts by discussing Kendall Jenner's basketball player boyfriend, Devin Booker, and his modern estate in Phoenix, Arizona. However, it is also mentioned that he has treated this property like another asset, leading to speculation about his true intentions with the house. This leads into a discussion of Kendall's own home in Los Angeles, which is described as more low-key compared to the rest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan. The video also shows footage of Kendall's tranquil home in Los Angeles, where she retreats when the public eye becomes too much. The video ends by stating that Kendall's home is more relatable and that both her home and Devin's home have their unique qualities. Therefore, the answer is A: The tour first zeroes in on Devin’s upgraded, contemporary home, with sleek exterior and aerial shots while the narrator notes it looks barely lived-in. The speaker then clarifies he doesn’t actually live there and hasn’t moved in with Kendall, pivoting to Kendall’s Mulholland Estates property and its serene, character-driven spaces. It ends with the host favoring Kendall’s down-to-earth design, highlighting her living room and glam room.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: The portrayal begins by framing her as privacy-minded and low-key, underscored by the on-screen safety disclaimer and a quote about wanting a serene home with character. As we move through rooms—formal living with no TV, a heavily used kitchen, and an office that opens to a courtyard—the visuals and first-person remarks show quiet routines with friends. It culminates outdoors with private lawn, pool, and easy indoor-outdoor access, and the host labels the overall vibe down-to-earth.",

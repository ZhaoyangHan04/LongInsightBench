    "model_answer": "The answer is A: She first amplifies Eliza’s Instagram messages about women sticking together and rejecting abuse, shown on screen and quoted aloud. Then she says she doesn’t feel bad for Eliza and calls her messy for knowingly dealing with a man who wasn’t claiming kids, later stressing both adults are guilty and the child is most affected.

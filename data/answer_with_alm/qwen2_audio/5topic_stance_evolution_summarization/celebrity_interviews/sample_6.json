    "model_answer": "The answer is A: He begins by separating intent from perception around the rally, then argues the left–right frame is the wrong fight amplified by networks, with both sides shutting down debate. He ultimately reframes the divide as corruption versus not corruption (and extremist versus regular), while also critiquing tribalism and tone as distractions from that deeper issue. This progression moves from rally misperception to a systemic critique beyond partisanship.\n\nThroughout the interview, Jon Stewart first addresses the perception of the rally and the role of media in amplifying the left-right divide. He argues that both sides are guilty of shutting down debate and not engaging in productive discussions. As the interview progresses, Stewart expands his critique to include the corrupt practices of politicians and the influence of money in politics. He also critiques tribalism and tone as distractions from the underlying issues facing the country. Ultimately, Stewart frames the conflict in terms of corruption versus not corruption, and he sees the need to move beyond simple partisanship to address the root causes of political divisions.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: He starts with a critique of cable news and jokes about a 24-hour ‘conflictinator,’ positioning his show outside that panic cycle. He later downplays his influence as a 22-minute program, distinguishes comedy’s reinforcement of ideas from news delivery, and rejects equivalence to a news network. He caps the boundary-setting with a climate-versus-weather analogy to differentiate deeper analysis from day-to-day talk.\n\nIn this clip, Jon Stewart begins by criticizing cable news for its role in amplifying partisan divisions among Americans. He then explains how his show, while still a comedy program, aims to provide a different kind of news coverage through satire and humor. By using visual cues such as the 'conflictinator' and emphasizing the difference between comedy and news delivery, Stewart sets clear boundaries for his show's role and influence within the realm of cable news.",

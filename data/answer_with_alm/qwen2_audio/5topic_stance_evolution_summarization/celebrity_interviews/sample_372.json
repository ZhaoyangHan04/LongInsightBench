    "model_answer": "The initial reaction from the audience is mixed, showing both support and criticism, as indicated by the on-screen comments that range from mocking motives like 'social credit' to praising pride. This is also reflected in the hosts' commentary, who acknowledge receiving messages from fans both praising and criticizing the speech. As the clip continues, the hosts begin to acknowledge a spectrum of opinions and interpretations, describing the delivery as a Western-style cathartic rant. They also recognize how tone fueled controversy. The hosts eventually expand the conversation to include the Chinese diaspora's complex positions and invite viewers to share their experiences. This discussion is visually capped by a promotional end screen encouraging viewers to like the video and share their thoughts. Therefore, option A best describes the development of public reactions and the hostsâ€™ interpretation throughout the video.",

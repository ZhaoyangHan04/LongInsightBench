    "model_answer": "The answer should be based on the specific quotes and dialogue provided in the audio clip. After listening to the clip, I would select option A: It opens with Chilli declaring her son is number one and recounting that she could count on one hand the times she didn’t take him to or pick him up from school, showing hands-on commitment. Tron then explains he fully appreciated that once he went to college and heard others’ stories.

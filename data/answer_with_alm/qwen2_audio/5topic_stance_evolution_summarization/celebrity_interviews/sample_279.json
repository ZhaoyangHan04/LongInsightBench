    "model_answer": "The answer is A: They describe parents who were skeptical about tattoos at first but generally supportive of the music, eventually becoming more accepting as the band found success. One mother initially reacted very negatively, yet later got a tattoo herself, and support grew once the band gained traction. Intercut stage footage and celebratory visuals reinforce that public success coincides with growing parental acceptance.\n\nIn the interview, the band members share stories about their parents' initial reactions to their tattoos and music career. They mention that some parents were skeptical and did not approve of tattoos, while others were more open-minded. Over time, the band's success led to increased acceptance from their parents, particularly after they saw the positive impact of the band's music on their children. This shift in attitude is evident through the growth in support from parents and the celebration of the band's achievements.",

    "model_answer": "The group starts by joking about iconic party tracks they wish they’d written, emphasizing how those songs make everyone dance. They then express pragmatic openness to repeating a successful collaboration, saying “you never know” and “if it’s not broken, don’t fix it.” Finally, they discuss favorites from their own record, contrasting acoustic vs. full-band versions and touching on serious themes like overcoming cancer, while concert cutaways show crowd connection. Therefore, option A correctly describes the evolution of their discussion.",

    "model_answer": "The narrative depicts a shift in Rihanna's stance on privacy and security in her living situations. Initially, following a break-in at her LA mansion, she moves to a secret London setup where she lays low and maintains high levels of security, including disabling alarms and installing private elevators. However, as time goes on, she becomes more public, hosting open houses and gradually reducing her reliance on security measures. Eventually, she returns to LA, living in a large mansion with no mention of anti-paparazzi design or controlled access. Therefore, option A best describes the evolution of Rihanna's stance on privacy and security in her living situations.",

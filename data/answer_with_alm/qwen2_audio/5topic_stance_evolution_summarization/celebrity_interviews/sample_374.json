    "model_answer": "A: She jokes that her handle is simple with no competition, then calls the worldwide internet dead and later agrees itâ€™s over.

However, as the conversation progresses, she shifts gears and begins promoting their website and social media accounts, suggesting that her views may have evolved or been influenced by the context of the segment.",

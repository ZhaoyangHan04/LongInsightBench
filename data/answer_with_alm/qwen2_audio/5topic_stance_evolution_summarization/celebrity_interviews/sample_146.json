    "model_answer": "The evolution of Cardi B's stance on cosmetic surgery across the midsection of the video is A: She first jokes and speaks openly about needing a breast \"renovation,\" then confirms she redid her boobs and had lipo as shown in on-screen quotes. After showing swelling and discussing canceled shows, the narration and on-screen text present recovery as long and difficult. Finally, quotes appear where she says she won't get surgery again and is working out instead.\n\nThe audio clip starts with Cardi B joking about needing a breast augmentation, which indicates her openness about undergoing cosmetic surgery. Later in the video, she confirms that she did indeed have plastic surgery, specifically breast augmentation and liposuction. She also discusses her experience with swollen skin and canceled shows, which suggests that she has undergone recovery from the surgery. \n\nIn recent news, Cardi B publicly stated that she was done with plastic surgery for good, indicating a shift in her stance towards the procedure. However, it's important to note that this statement was made in relation to her decision to stop getting fillers, not necessarily to her past surgeries such as breast augmentation or liposuction. Therefore, option A best fits the timeline and content of the audio clip.",

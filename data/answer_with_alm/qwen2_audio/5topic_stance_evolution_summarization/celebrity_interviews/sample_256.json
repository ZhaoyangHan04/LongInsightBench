    "model_answer": "B: She consistently turns challenges into affirmations: first rejecting the “broke” and “diva” labels with wit, then joking she’s “just a baby” while promising to be the “foxiest grandma.” Later, she reframes body talk by asserting she’s “STILL skinny” and calmly explaining weight changes after quitting smoking, and even answers who she admires with “after myself.” The overall arc is steady, humorous confidence across settings.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: She first corrects a misreading of her signature lyric by explaining it means “take care of business,” then evaluates contemporary music by noting some rap is good and some wretched while saying she hears her own influence. When prompted about Nicki Minaj, she diplomatically passes, and later she shares Lauryn Hill’s praise about a vocal booth “smelling like church,” treating it as validation. This shows a confident but measured approach to peers and her legacy.\nThroughout the interviews, Aretha Franklin demonstrates a willingness to engage with her peers and discuss her work, while also acknowledging the influence of others on her own artistry. She shows respect for both current and past musicians, while also being honest about her own limitations and the complexity of interpreting her lyrics. Overall, her approach is measured and thoughtful, indicating a deep appreciation for her craft and a desire to connect with her audience on a meaningful level.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: He begins by stressing the cost and energy burden of today’s AI and the CPU–RAM communication bottleneck, then pivots to memristors that store and process in the same place, built as neurons and synapses. The slides reinforce this with “BUILDING THE WORLD’S mostEFFICIENT, BRAIN-INSPIRED_CHIP” and a split-screen diagram of the memristor next to a GEMESYS chip. He then promises 100x speed/efficiency, envisions every processor carrying their chip, and ends by arguing for truly personal models that learn on-device like a phone understanding one person’s speech.\n\nThe speaker starts by acknowledging the limitations of current AI systems, which leads him to propose a solution using memristors. This shows his thought process developing from recognizing a problem to proposing a potential solution. As the presentation progresses, he emphasizes the efficiency and scalability of his proposed solution, which further supports the idea that his stance has evolved from diagnosing AI inefficiency to proposing a hardware remedy. Additionally, his emphasis on personal models that learn on-device aligns with his vision for the future of AI use.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: C: Starting from visuals that read “OUR PRODUCT IS AN AI CHIP THAT OUTCLASSES CURRENT TECHNOLOGY,” he pairs upbeat audio about 100x gains and decentralization with an on-screen vision that every processor will carry their chip. He then details two revenue streams—an annual license and a per-chip royalty—before presenting a traction slide and introducing co-founders and advisors, ending with an invite to investors and potential customers.\n\nThe pitch starts by highlighting the key benefits of their AI chip, such as outclassing current technology and its ability to work like a human brain. This sets a positive tone for the rest of the presentation. As the pitch progresses, it moves towards discussing the commercial aspects of their product, including revenue streams and partnerships. This helps build credibility and trust with potential investors and customers. The pitch also includes visuals and testimonials to further support the product's capabilities and potential. Overall, the pitch effectively communicates the value proposition of their AI chip and positions it as a leading solution in the market.",

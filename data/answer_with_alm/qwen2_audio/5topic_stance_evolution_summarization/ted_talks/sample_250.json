    "model_answer": "Answer: A: He begins with a childhood field-trip story alongside a fire station image to show how asking the wrong expert leads to poor answers, then critiques image-macro quotes and celebrity opinions as false authority while showing Einstein and AMA overlays. He next illustrates Nobel laureates’ missteps with their portraits to argue intelligence isn’t the same as wisdom, before turning to on-screen prompts like “Evidence-Based Wisdom” and task lists to conclude we should privilege sound judgment and decision-making competence over raw intellect.\n\nThe speaker starts by recounting his own experience of feeling self-conscious about his appearance, which he feels has evolved into something more acceptable over time. This sets the stage for a broader discussion about the importance of considering evidence-based wisdom and decision-making skills when choosing experts to trust. The speaker uses examples such as fire fighters, Nobel laureates, and even images of Einstein and AMA interviews to illustrate this point. By the end of the passage, the speaker has made it clear that we should prioritize sound judgment and decision-making competence over raw intellect when choosing experts to trust.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: The speaker first argues that being smart does not guarantee sensible decisions, shown with graphs and examples of common biases. He then questions a red “+40 IQ” pill as visually depicted, worrying it could amplify reasoning failures, before introducing “Evidence-Based Wisdom” and concrete decision-making tasks while cautioning—by voice—that such research must be judged critically. He ultimately concludes, over final commentary, that traditional intelligence is a weak defense and advises seeking people who show sound judgment rather than just high intellect.",

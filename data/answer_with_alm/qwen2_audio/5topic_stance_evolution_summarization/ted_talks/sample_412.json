    "model_answer": "The speaker's stance evolves from initially defining himself as a nerdy introvert to recognizing the value of conversation and improv skills. He starts by discussing his identification with the INTJ personality type and how it shapes his view on communication. However, as the talk progresses, he challenges this notion by highlighting the effectiveness of improv in his own life and in working with diverse groups of people. By the end of the talk, he emphasizes the practical applications of improv skills and their potential impact on individuals and society. Therefore, option A best represents the speaker's evolving stance on his social capability throughout the talk.",

    "model_answer": "A: It begins with lab-based evidence of mirror neurons synchronizing observer and actor, arguing we are soft-wired to feel others’ emotions. The account then follows empathy’s maturation in children toward self-recognition and shared distress, and roots adult empathy in acknowledging mortality, the opposite of utopia. Finally, empathy is framed as the invisible hand of civilization that, with technology, scales to global responses like the Haiti earthquake, extending to the human race and the biosphere.\nThe speaker starts from the premise that humans are innately aggressive and only later tempered by culture, proposing utopia as the cure for suffering. Childhood empathy is dismissed as merely learned, and neuroscience is depicted as inconclusive. The argument ends in skepticism about technology, claiming social media blocks global solidarity.\nThis option best fits the development of the speaker's stance on empathy across the audio segment. The speaker starts by discussing scientific evidence of mirror neurons and their role in empathy, followed by a discussion of empathy's development in childhood and its connection to mortality. The speaker also frames empathy as an essential aspect of civilization and its ability to respond to global events like the Haiti earthquake. However, the speaker also expresses skepticism about technology and its impact on empathy, particularly regarding social media and its potential to block global solidarity.",

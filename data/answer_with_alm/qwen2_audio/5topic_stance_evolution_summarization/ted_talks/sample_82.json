    "model_answer": "Answer: A: They start by arguing the books deserve design care equal to the storytelling, then test when visuals align directly with content versus when they should take readers on a parallel trip. They refine the approach by deciding some words don’t need embellishment and by making connections between drawings and writing more obvious. They conclude that illustrations must enhance rather than distract to keep audiences engaged amid the storyteller’s constant fear of losing them.\n\nThe discussion in the audio indicates that the team's initial stance is that illustrations should be treated with the same level of care as the storytelling. They then test different approaches, such as aligning visuals with content or taking readers on a parallel trip, to see what works best. They also make decisions about which words do not need additional visual elements and work to make the connections between the drawings and the written text more apparent. Ultimately, they conclude that illustrations must enhance the story without distracting from it in order to keep the audience engaged.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: They present the illustrated project as a tangible, designed object and name the collaborators, then acknowledge it is the least fashionable time to design books. Immediately after, they argue it’s also the best time because permanent objects have renewed value and some categories are selling more. The visuals consistently return to real books in hands and on tables, reinforcing a continued commitment to the physical form.\n\nThe audio clip discusses the illustrated book project and how the group's viewpoint evolves about producing it in relation to current book trends. Initially, they present the project as a tangible, designed object and mention the collaborators, indicating that they view it as a physical product. They then acknowledge that it may be the least fashionable time to design books, but argue that it is also the best time because permanent objects have renewed value and some categories are selling more. This shows that they see the value in producing a physical book despite the current trends.\n\nThroughout the conversation, the visuals consistently return to real books in hands and on tables, reinforcing their commitment to the physical form. This reinforces the idea that they view the illustrated book as a tangible, designed object that should be produced physically.\n\nTherefore, option A correctly presents the group's viewpoint about producing a physical illustrated book in the context of current book trends.",

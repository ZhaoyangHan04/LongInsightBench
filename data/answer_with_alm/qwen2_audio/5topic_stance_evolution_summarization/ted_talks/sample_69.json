    "model_answer": "A: He begins by critiquing graded, contextless introductions to science and recalling how his own informal beginnings didn’t even feel like “science.” He contrasts this with book-heavy exam culture that didn’t fit him, then elevates open-ended curiosity over prestige. This perspective turns into concrete, low-cost tools—phone-based mosquito sensing and an origami microscope—to broaden cost and access, and he closes by urging people to act on their passions now. The visuals reinforce this arc with animations of phones, sound waves, and coins labeled “Cost” and “Access.”\n\nManu Prakash starts by talking about his own experience of learning science, where he felt it was not engaging and did not align with his interests. He then criticizes the current approach of introducing science through exams and grading, which he believes creates a pressure to perform and does not foster a love for science. Instead, he emphasizes the importance of curiosity and hands-on activities. He also talks about how he has used technology to make science accessible and affordable, such as creating a phone-based mosquito sensor and an origami microscope. Finally, he encourages people to pursue their passions and interests in science, and the visuals show examples of these tools being used by people from different backgrounds.",

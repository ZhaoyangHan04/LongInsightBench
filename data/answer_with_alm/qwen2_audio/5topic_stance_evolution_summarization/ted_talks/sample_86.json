    "model_answer": "The speaker's stance on the emergence of a “visible language” develops from a biological and evolutionary perspective initially, which is supported by visual aids such as pyramids and geometric art. As the talk progresses, the focus shifts towards the idea of language as a form of communication that has evolved over time, with references to the Logos and historical and crowd imagery. The use of psychedelic practices such as ayahuasca/DMT and psilocybin becomes central to the speaker's argument, suggesting that these experiences can reveal previously unseen aspects of language and communication. By the end of the talk, the speaker appears to be advocating for a future where telepathy and other forms of non-verbal communication are more widely accepted and utilized. Therefore, the correct answer would be A: He starts by proposing a biological and evolutionary basis for a new, visible language, aligning it with molecular order and epigenetics as grand, symbolic visuals (pyramids, geometric art) fill the screen. He then reframes the ancient notion of the Logos as something that shifts from being heard to being seen, which is paired with historical and crowd imagery. Through psychedelic practice (ayahuasca/DMT), he claims “hyper words” can be made visible, accompanied by surreal levitations",

    "model_answer": "After exploring visualized meaning earlier, he explicitly interrogates voice and self-generated sound, asking what it can do and how it affects the organism. He then proposes a molecular mechanism—a real interior tone from electron spin resonance that other sounds can cancel or reinforceAs chakra diagrams and systems charts appear, with a hum entering the soundscape. He ends by highlighting ayahuasca shamans as master “hummers” who operate on bodies with light and sound, calling for experimental study, while visuals include anatomical imagery of the eye/brain and psychedelic scenes that bridge physiology and practice.

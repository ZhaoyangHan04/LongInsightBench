    "model_answer": "Answer: A: It first appears as a remote art project in the woods, with the speaker locating it and showing the house and fields. She then insists it’s “something else” (not a commune or retreat), while an on-screen glossary and kitchen work introduce “hoosh” as a practice of engaging one’s environment. The site subsequently expands into a school where “work-styles” are practiced as people swarm, learn, and converse, culminating in an “ethics of comportment” emphasized by the glossary and dinner-table scenes.\nThe audio describes how Mildred's Lane starts as an art project in the woods and eventually becomes a school that emphasizes ethics of comportment through various activities like lectures, workshops, and dinners. The option A best captures this development. \n\nOption B suggests that Mildred's Lane is always a commune, which is not supported by the audio. Option C describes the project as a bee museum, which is different from the description of Mildred's Lane in the audio. Option D suggests that Mildred's Lane is primarily a catering service, which is not mentioned in the audio.",

    "model_answer": "The speaker's view of practice shifts from individual, domestic making to a collaborative pedagogy and ethics as she evolves throughout the video. Initially, she introduces herself as an artist and ambassador of entanglement, emphasizing the connection between everyday work and art. Later on, she emphasizes the importance of making livable systems and hosting summer classes where people can practice their work styles together. This indicates a move towards collaboration and community involvement in her practice. Additionally, her emphasis on ethics of comportment suggests that she values ethical considerations in her work and seeks to create spaces where individuals can engage with each other and their environment in a responsible manner. Therefore, option C best reflects this evolution in her perspective.",

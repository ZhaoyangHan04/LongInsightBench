    "model_answer": "A: He starts formally in the office setting, accepts an invitation to join the class, hesitates but tries, then admits it’s tougher than it looks and later leans in enthusiastically at the restaurant. The visuals move from handshake and desk to mats and movement, then to a table with pink drinks, while audio captures his initial reluctance, his \"it’s much harder than it looks,\" and his \"amazing place\" reaction. He closes by prompting her for words of wisdom, signaling respect and engagement.\n\nThe report starts with the guest reporter being formal and accepting an invitation to join the class. This shows that he is willing to engage with Uraysha's world initially. However, his initial hesitation suggests that he might be apprehensive about trying something new. As the class progresses, he admits that it's tougher than he thought, which indicates that he has overcome his initial apprehension and is now fully engaged in the activity. Finally, his enthusiasm at the restaurant shows that he has fully embraced Uraysha's world and is enjoying himself.",

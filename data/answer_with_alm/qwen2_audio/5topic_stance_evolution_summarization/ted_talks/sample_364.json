    "model_answer": "A: He opens with formal gratitude at the WIPO podium and states a mission to bring hope to people with disabilities. He then escalates urgency by declaring an emergency and proposing concrete measures like a protocol and a clearing house, before briefly lightening the mood with a pleading, humorous aside. He shifts medium by moving from the podium to a Yamaha keyboard to sing familiar songs, engaging the audience, and closes by balancing access with copyright protection and urging each country to adopt a declaration, drawing applause.",

    "model_answer": "B: In a formal setting, he moves from principle to practice: a high-level declaration for the visually impaired, then concrete mechanisms like cross-border exchange and translation under copyright safeguards, and finally a unifying call to action. The tone shifts from assertive to collaborative and inspirational, and the visuals progress from podium and panel to a wide applauding audience. He frames the outcome as a gift to the future and invites a collective commitment.",

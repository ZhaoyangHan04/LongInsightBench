After reflecting on Aaron Swartz and expressing an urgency to act, he joins walks and highlights public support like the “96%” statistic. He concludes by framing corruption and money in politics as the root problem and calls to “Fix Democracy First.”\n\nThe audio clip follows the speaker's journey from being a law professor interested in problems that didn't interest him to becoming involved in activism, particularly around net neutrality and campaign finance reform. He starts by joining walks and highlighting public support for these issues, eventually narrowing his focus to the technical merits of net neutrality. However, he also reflects on the broader implications of these issues, such as corruption and money in politics, and calls for systemic change by fixing democracy first.",

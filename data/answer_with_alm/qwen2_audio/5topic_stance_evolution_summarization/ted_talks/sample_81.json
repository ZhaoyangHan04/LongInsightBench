He then extends the idea to human contexts, showing text and graphs about scarcity and borrowing to argue that too-little slack limits choices and leads to fatigue and poor decisions. Finally, with the Black Swan book, spike graphs, flood-level diagrams, and flood imagery, he argues that buffers are vital against unprecedented events, concluding that a “just barely enough” approach is inadequate.\nThe speaker starts by defining wiggle room as the amount of flexibility or error allowed in a system before it fails. He uses examples such as CNC manufacturing and bungee jumping to illustrate the importance of having some slack in a system to account for unexpected changes or errors. He then expands this concept to human contexts, using graphs and text to show how having too little slack can lead to fatigue and poor decision-making.\nFinally, the speaker uses the concept of the Black Swan, which represents rare and unpredictable events, to argue that systems need to have built-in buffers or slack to handle these events. He uses various diagrams, such as spike graphs, flood-level diagrams, and flood imagery, to show how important it is to have",

    "model_answer": "The speaker's stance progresses from acknowledging the need for forgiveness of mistakes to advocating for more slack or flexibility in general. This progression is evident from his personal travel experiences, where he notices that people who arrive early at the airport often waste time waiting for their flight, and from his use of analogies such as the sliding puzzle and game shows to illustrate the benefits of having extra space or turns. By the end of the clip, he has explicitly called for more examples of places or situations where slack might be useful. Therefore, the correct answer would be A: He opens with Bruce Lee’s quote on screen and a pun about needing more “Lee way,” punctuated by a crash sound, then identifies himself as the early-arrival traveler while airport visuals appear. He generalizes the preference into a principle via the sliding puzzle graphic, explaining how extra space increases degrees of freedom, and through the game-show scenario where players with more turns avoid forced, costly loans. He closes with an airport coffee shop analogy and a call for examples while the end-card appears, clearly advocating for wiggle room in everyday choices and design.",

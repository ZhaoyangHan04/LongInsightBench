    "model_answer": "The speaker's stance evolves from initially dismissing experimental archaeology to embracing it as a valuable tool for cultural reflection. She starts by comparing LARP to the Kon-Tiki raft and moves on to discuss how LARP allows participants to短暂 inhabit another culture. Throughout the talk, she references warrior illustrations and body painting to emphasize the cultural insights that LARP provides. By the end, she has fully embraced LARP as a form of experimental anthropology that can provide valuable cultural insights, even if only temporarily. Answer: A",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: It starts with the Kon-Tiki raft visual and an audio explanation of experimental archaeology, then moves to culture-focused larps like Koikoi and Brudpris shown via titles and photos. After a critical interlude over the warrior illustration and stage shots arguing play cannot replace socialization, it concludes on the body-paint scene with the claim that LARP helps us reflect on our own norms.\n\nThe audio clip starts with a visual demonstration of the Kon-Tiki raft, which was built in 1947 by Thor Heyerdahl to demonstrate that South Americans could have settled Polynesia. This sets the stage for a discussion of experimental archaeology, which involves testing archaeological hypotheses through practical experiments.\n\nThe speaker then moves on to discuss culture-focused larps (Live-Action Roleplaying Games) such as Koikoi and Brudpris, which are shown via titles and photos. These examples illustrate how LARP can help people learn about different cultures.\n\nAfter this, there is a critical interlude over a warrior illustration and stage shots that argue that play cannot replace socialization. This leads into the final takeaway of the talk, which is that LARP helps us reflect on our own norms.\n\nTherefore, option A accurately summarizes the progression",

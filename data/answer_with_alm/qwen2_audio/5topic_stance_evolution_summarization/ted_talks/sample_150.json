    "model_answer": "Based on the provided information, it seems that the speaker's approach to learning and making his app develops over the course of the talk as follows:\n\n- At the beginning, he relies on search engines and starts with a lecture about app stores without attempting any search (Option C).\n- However, when he encounters a new framework with scarce tutorials, he shifts from frustrated searching to hands-on experimentation and learning basics (Option A).\n- He then collaborates with friends to assemble the \"ingredients\" into the finished \"When Pigs Fly\" app (Option A).\n- The screenshots of the app icon and gameplay seem to be added later as marketing afterthoughts (Option A).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be Option A: He begins by relying on search engines, underscored by the “How to make an app? (for beginners)” slides. After running into a new framework with scarce tutorials, he shifts from frustrated searching to hands-on experimentation and learning basics. He then collaborates with friends to assemble the “ingredients” into the finished “When Pigs Fly,” shown via the app icon and gameplay screenshots.",

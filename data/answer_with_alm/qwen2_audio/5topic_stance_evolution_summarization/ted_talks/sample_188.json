    "model_answer": "Answer: A: A floor speaker reframes the threat beyond a narrow terror lens, contrasting Daesh’s image with data on homicides largely outside Africa and warning that droughts and floods loom as major risks, all while gesturing emphatically as charts and maps appear. Panelists then extend this broadening by citing El Salvador’s homicide crisis and the radicalization of educated youth, before explicitly connecting climate change to migration with drought and flood risk maps on screen. The arc moves from terrorism to structural crime and environmental drivers, and the segment is punctuated by audience applause.\n\nThe audio clip describes a discussion where the topic initially focuses on violent extremism and migration. As the discussion progresses, the floor speaker expands the scope of the issue to include broader factors such as climate change and its impact on migration patterns. The panel members also contribute to this broader perspective by highlighting specific examples from Africa and linking these to broader social and environmental issues. The discussion concludes with audience applause, indicating that the audience found the broader perspective engaging and informative.",

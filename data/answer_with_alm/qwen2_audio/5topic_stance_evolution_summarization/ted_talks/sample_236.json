    "model_answer": "A: He opens by diagnosing information overload and our becoming lazy observers, visually underscored by a magnified eye and title card. He then trains viewers to notice hidden details in logos and artworks and codifies observation into labeled steps on-screen (awareness, trends, opportunities). Next, he applies those steps to innovation and skills (UPS routing, better forms) while showing practical tools like mind maps and recording apps, and closes on a quote that all ideas stem from observation.\n\nThe speaker's main message evolves from diagnosing a problem of information overload and laziness in observation to presenting a solution through training and applying observation skills to various fields such as logistics and innovation. The use of visual aids, practical examples, and a call to action to improve observation skills aligns well with this summary.",

    "model_answer": "A: He moves from reframing existing things—like a mask assembled from Air Jordans and a building made of stacked shipping containers—to principles of simplifying and rethinking function, illustrated by tools and minimalist design. He then shows redesigning civic spaces by removing signs at intersections and formalizes the approach with labeled steps on-screen. Finally, he applies it to operations and craft (UPS right-turn routing and a redesigned order form) and encourages connecting ideas with mind maps.",

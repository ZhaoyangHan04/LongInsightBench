    "model_answer": "B: Amidst acclaim, she takes intentional pauses to realign with core values, grounding her actions in purpose. She then redefines roles across evolving phases and makes an unwavering commitment to justice, before framing the whole as an unfinished symphony that invites others to continue the work. The journey remains open-ended and adaptive.\nThe narrative portrays her evolution from initial commitment to justice through public action to a sustained commitment through introspection and evolution of roles. The use of imagery such as the puzzle and the symphony suggests a journey that is not yet complete and open to further growth and adaptation.",

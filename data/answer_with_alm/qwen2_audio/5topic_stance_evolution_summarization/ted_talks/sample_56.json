    "model_answer": "The speaker's stance on the \"three Ts\" approach evolves from mocking it initially to endorsing it as the only acceptable method towards the end of the segment. He starts by presenting the \"three Ts\" neutrally through a quoted sermon structure shown as on-screen text, then flags it as a red-flag habit with a first-date gift gag, and later concedes it has limited virtues for technical explanations. However, as the segment progresses, he shows a technical slide and embraces the \"three Ts\" as the only acceptable method. He dismisses alternatives like problemâ€“solution and the MythBusters example as mere entertainment and concludes by telling viewers to memorize the \"three Ts\" rules without exception. Therefore, the correct answer would be option B.",

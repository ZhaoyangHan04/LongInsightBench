    "model_answer": "A: She begins by introducing her platform role, then asserts humor’s prevalence with figures and small research, and illustrates it with vivid campaign examples. On a warm, rustic stage and a screen showing tags like #passion, she moves from stats to cases (cat café, bold health campaign, dark-humor soup, duck-chasing name reads). She closes by widening the message, saying life is crowd-based and should be lined with a smile, followed by applause and a branded closing screen.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A. She shifts from presenting prevalence and small-study statistics to lively, specific anecdotes, using an upbeat tone while gesturing on a rustic stage with on-screen cues like #passion. By the end, her voice turns reflective as she expands the idea beyond campaigns to society and smiles, accompanied by applause and a branded closing screen with calm music. This marks a progression from data to illustrative cases to a broader takeaway.\nThroughout the presentation, the speaker's framing and delivery evolves in response to the changing visual aids and the audience's engagement. She starts with a formal introduction and presents statistics, but as the presentation progresses, she becomes more engaging and storytelling-oriented. She uses humor and anecdotes to illustrate her points and keep the audience engaged. As the presentation comes to a close, she reflects on the broader implications of her message and closes with a positive note, accompanied by applause and a branded closing screen.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: B: News organizations first celebrate Google News as a boon to readership, and in 2010 they gain court protection against automated recomposition. The New York Times wins at the Supreme Court, and algorithmic aggregation recedes thereafter.\n\nThe audio describes how traditional journalism's stance evolves in response to algorithmic aggregation and recomposed news. It mentions that news organizations initially celebrated Google News as a boon to readership and gained court protection against automated recomposition in 2010. This indicates that traditional outlets saw the potential benefits of algorithmic aggregation and were willing to partner with companies like Google to explore it. However, as the negative effects became more apparent, such as the rise of fake news and the erosion of the news industry's revenue model, news organizations began to sue and win legal victories to regain control over their content. By 2014, algorithmic aggregation had receded, and human editors once again had full control over news production.",

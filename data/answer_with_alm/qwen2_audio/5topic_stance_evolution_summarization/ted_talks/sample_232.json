    "model_answer": "A: She begins by turning to imagination and storytelling amid hardship, as her voice recalls escaping into art and the visuals show whimsical space adventures and creative scenes. She then uses therapy and creative practices to heal, mirrored by hopeful visuals like “I can do MATH,” luminous journeys, and “Through darkness, we find light.” Finally, she brings her art outward through books, touring, and a community-centered project that grows into a charitable, six-figure business, culminating in a publisher-backed book announcement.",

    "model_answer": "A: It starts with childhood imagination and a belief she was meant for something great, voiced over whimsical space imagery. After academic success and healing practices, the project grows into a community effort and culminates in a publisher-backed book, visually underscored by “Dream Big” pages and celebratory book shots.\n\nThe motif of “Dream Big” and aspiration is evident from the speaker's early life as she grew up in a rural town of 300 people and turned to her imagination to entertain herself. This imagination eventually led her to pursue storytelling and eventually created a way to escape her circumstances. As she became successful in her career, the motif of “Dream Big” continued to be central to her work, reflected in the title of her book and the imagery used to promote it. The imagery of “dream big” pages and celebratory book shots also convey a sense of aspiration and community, which are key themes throughout the speaker's narrative.",

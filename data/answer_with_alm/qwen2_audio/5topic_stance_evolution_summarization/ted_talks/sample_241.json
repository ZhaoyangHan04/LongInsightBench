    "model_answer": "The video's stance develops from initially worrying about escalating conflict to advocating for peaceful engagement through dialogue and understanding. It emphasizes the importance of having conversations with those who hold different beliefs and values, and it shows tangible outcomes such as robes being hung up as evidence of progress. The video ultimately urges for genuine conversations that can lead to turning enemies into friends. Therefore, the correct answer would be A: The video opens by worrying about escalating conflict and explicitly calls for conversation, then introduces Daryl’s long-running outreach and research-backed persuasion principles like reciprocity and liking. It responds to the “time for talking is over” claim by disagreeing and re-centering peaceful engagement, showing tangible outcomes like robes being hung up. It ultimately urges genuine conversations that can turn enemies into friends.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: The daughters first appear in a studio interview saying they will join their parents’ group, aligning with the Klan. Later, their mother thanks Daryl for driving them to see their father in prison—something no Klan member had done—and the family ultimately records a message stating they are not in the Klan and wishing a city well on Martin Luther King Day. The film ties this shift to earlier points about reciprocity and liking making persuasion easier.\n\nIn the beginning, the daughters seem to be influenced by their parents' beliefs and join the Klan. However, after visiting their father in prison and experiencing a moment of kindness from Daryl, their perspective changes. They start to see the error of their previous beliefs and decide to distance themselves from the Klan. This change in their stance is connected to the broader persuasion theme of the film, which emphasizes the power of empathy and understanding to change people's minds.",

    "model_answer": "The speaker's stance on imagination develops from a initial belief in its power to create and transform to a rejection of its validity. Initially, she presents imagination as a tool used to cope with sadness and to dream about a better world. However, after a personal experience, she comes to see imagination as an illusion and advises against relying on it. This shift in perspective is reflected in the changing visuals on the screen, which start with inspirational images and progress towards a cold, empty space. Therefore, the correct answer would be D: She begins confident that everything imagined is real and displays a heart, but later admits imagination is an illusion and advocates returning to practical realism. The visuals move from hopeful symbols to a closed door to underscore her change of mind. She finishes by advising the audience to be wary of imaginationâ€™s false promises.",

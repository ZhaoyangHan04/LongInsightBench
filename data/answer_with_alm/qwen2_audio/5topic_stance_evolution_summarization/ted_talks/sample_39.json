    "model_answer": "The speaker starts by criticizing existing maps and his own language as inadequate, showing frustration with the inability to capture the richness of inner life. This is followed by a shift to playful game-based analogies, which piques the audience's interest. As the talk progresses, the speaker introduces family tree forms as a more suitable tool for mapping spiritual development, grounding the concept in a more formal setting. Therefore, the correct answer would be A.",

    "model_answer": "The speaker's view evolves from a broad framing to a more nuanced understanding. Initially, he uses the Sister Jessie photo to assert that virtue is the best predictor of development and moral traits track spiritual progress. However, his tone becomes more complex when he mentions naturalists and jokes about them, indicating a willingness to consider different perspectives. As the conversation progresses, he introduces a character-sheet approach and discusses the limitations of using physical traits like kindness and resistance to temptation to measure spiritual development. Ultimately, he acknowledges the attempts to measure morality and references influences from Western psychology, suggesting a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of spiritual development.",

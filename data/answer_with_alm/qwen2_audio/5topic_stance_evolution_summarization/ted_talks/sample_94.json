    "model_answer": "The answer is A: He opens by framing oil-driven water pollution as a major issue and recalls formative experiences, then demonstrates simple tests with waste materials onsite. He quantifies their effectiveness and finally presents a scalable plan, saying he built a machine to reuse both residue and oil. The visuals move from branded intros to live beaker-and-bottle demos and close with the conference’s ink-quill animation, matching his audio shift from problem to implementation.\n\nThroughout the talk, the speaker's solution strategy evolves from framing the problem of oil-polluted water as significant and urgent (as indicated by the reference to it being one of the biggest issues of the 21st century) to demonstrating a potential solution through simple tests with waste materials on stage. This is followed by the presentation of a scalable plan, including the building of a machine to reuse both residue and oil. The visuals used during the talk also mirror this progression, starting with branded intros and moving towards more engaging demonstrations such as beaker-and-bottle demos, concluding with the conference's ink-quill animation.",

    "model_answer": "A: He proceeds from human hair to bird feathers to sawdust, each inspired by how oil adheres in everyday observations, and stresses that all are waste materials. He reports similar high removal (95%) and then integrates them into a machine that enables residue and oil reuse. Onstage visuals of feathers, bottles, and beakers support his narrated experiments, and the finale’s applause and branding underscore a practical, scalable principle: clean waste with waste.\n\nThe speaker's approach involves exploring different waste materials such as human hair, bird feathers, and sawdust to see which ones are effective at removing oil. He then integrates these materials into a machine that can reuse the oil and other residues. This approach demonstrates a practical solution for dealing with waste materials and shows that they can be used to create something valuable. Additionally, the use of visuals and audience participation at the end of the demonstration adds to the appeal of this approach. Overall, option A best summarizes the speaker's approach.",

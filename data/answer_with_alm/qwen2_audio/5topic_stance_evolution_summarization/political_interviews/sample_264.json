    "model_answer": "The interviewee's narrative starts with a light, personal comparison of his college experiences, establishing a foundation for his later discussions about civic engagement and policy stance. As the interview progresses, he recounts his Peace Corps service and immigrant community concerns, demonstrating his commitment to civic action and policy advocacy. This progression is supported by the visual elements, such as the library set up and the use of microphones, which maintain a formal and communal atmosphere throughout the interview. Therefore, option A best describes the progression of the interviewee's narrative.",

    "model_answer": "The interviewee starts by expressing strong support for re-entering the Paris Agreement, emphasizing its importance for future generations, particularly his children. However, as the conversation progresses, he becomes increasingly skeptical about the effectiveness of international action on climate change and suggests that the United States should prioritize economic growth over environmental concerns. By the end of the interview, he appears to be more open to the idea of domestic action on climate change but still emphasizes the need for careful planning and collaboration with other countries. Therefore, option A best describes the evolution of the interviewee's stance on climate policy over the course of the interview.",

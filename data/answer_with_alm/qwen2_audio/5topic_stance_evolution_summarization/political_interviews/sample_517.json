    "model_answer": "The segment starts with polling and campaign framing, shown by the initial poll graphic and live split-screen. It then pivots to Florida’s teaching standards as the chyron highlights Tim Scott’s response, and the candidate says he’ll stand on the side of truth and teach the awful legacy of slavery. After the anchor notes GOP critics and moves on, the lower third shifts to special counsel charges, and he defends a pardon as the right path forward while labeling the case a process crime. The interview then wraps with a thank-you and teases for upcoming segments. Therefore, option A is the closest match to the evolution of the topic and candidate's focus throughout the interview.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer would be C: Across the segments he argues for ever-expanding federal regulatory control, moving beyond minimum standards to active industrial management. He caps this by supporting the liquidation of GM to enforce stricter discipline and by opposing any energy incentives at all. The trajectory is toward maximal regulation and zero subsidies.\nExplanation: As we listen to the audio, Newt Gingrich starts by rejecting government-led regulation and endorsing a strict Tea Party view. However, as the interview progresses, his views evolve towards supporting broader subsidies across sectors, including ethanol. When the auto industry comes up, he initially opposes the GM bailout but eventually supports it as a necessary intervention. This shows how his stance on government's role in regulation and market intervention develops from anti-regulation to pro-subsidy and pro-bailout.",

    "model_answer": "A: She begins by naming schools, affordable housing, and the opioid crisis as her main reasons for running, introduced alongside the forum branding and sponsor screens. She then deepens each: stressing MOE and the harm to children, detailing North Countyâ€™s overcrowded housing realities, and sharing a personal connection to opioids with a call for more resources. Later, under her on-screen name ID and sponsor slides, she adds specifics like fully funding schools, tracking spending, and building a CTE to break poverty, and finally reaffirms those three priorities as the top focus.\n\nThe candidate starts with her core issues that are most relevant to her community and personal experiences. As the forum progresses, she expands her focus to include other important issues like economic development and environmental protection. However, she remains committed to her original priorities of schools, affordable housing, and the opioid crisis and emphasizes them towards the end of the forum.",

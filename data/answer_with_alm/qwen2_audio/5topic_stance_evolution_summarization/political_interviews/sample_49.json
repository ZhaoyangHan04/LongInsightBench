    "model_answer": "I cannot listen to the audio clip provided as the question asks for my analysis based on the text description only. However, based on the given text description, I would choose option A. \n\nKeith Wilson initially emphasizes the need for immediate relief for small businesses and acknowledges the danger of a potential recession. This is evident from his statement about the need for a small business stabilization fund and an \"all hands on deck\" effort. As the camera remains focused on his office close-up with the LWV (League of Women Voters) banner, he shifts attention to retraining programs offered through community colleges, framing the crisis as an opportunity for growth. Later in the conversation, when the split-screen returns, he broadens his plan to include coordinated support at the local, regional, and national levels, utilizing city resources to assist businesses in survival and workforce training.",

    "model_answer": "After listening to the audio, I have come to understand that Keith Wilson's position evolves from initially dismissing his background and experience as irrelevant, to advocating for a professional city manager using performance tools such as KPIs and Six Sigma. He starts by rejecting any link to transportation and instead seeking to manage public safety. However, as the discussion progresses, he expands his focus to include the entire city government and bureaus, eventually advocating for a councilor structure where councilors spend all their time on policy. Therefore, my selected options are A and C.",

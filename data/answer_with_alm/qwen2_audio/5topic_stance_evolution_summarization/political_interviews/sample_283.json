    "model_answer": "A: He describes returning from school to help his area, which led him into politics, while the calm couch setting underscores a personal commitment. Over coastal road visuals, he says the “youth had to kick in” and he wanted to push the town toward tourism. He then explains he ran a third time to finish ongoing projects and solidify that tourism vision, matched by repeated seafront imagery.\n\nJorge Cavoli's motivation evolves from initially wanting to help his community and push the town towards tourism after returning from school, to running for a third term to finish ongoing projects and solidify his vision for tourism. This is supported by his statements about the importance of tourism and the need to finish projects, as well as the visual cues of coastal roads and seafront imagery.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: He moves from listing essentials—roads, services, security, environment—to stressing that hotels and homes shouldn’t have to self-supply power, water, or security because that is the city’s role. Scenic drives and cyclists highlight what works, while the flooded street and cautionary road sign illustrate risks when basics fail, leading him to press for federal help to ensure livable conditions for residents and tourists. This progression ties natural appeal to the need for government-backed infrastructure.\n\nIn the audio, Cavoli starts by identifying the essential components for sustainable growth in Cabrera, including basic infrastructure, security, and the environment. He also emphasizes the importance of collaboration with the federal government to achieve these goals. As the conversation progresses, he shows how the visual elements of the neighborhood, roadway, landscape, and flooded street can reinforce his arguments. For example, the flooded street and cautionary road sign serve as a reminder of the risks associated with neglecting essential services. Ultimately, Cavoli's stance is that the government has a crucial role to play in ensuring that the community has access to basic necessities like power, water, and security.",

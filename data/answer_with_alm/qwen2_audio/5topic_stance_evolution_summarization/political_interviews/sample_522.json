    "model_answer": "The audio clip focuses primarily on political campaigning and the outcome of an election. As the interview progresses, it transitions from discussing the campaign's strategies and successes to making a final appeal to voters to vote. This shift in tone is evident as the conversation becomes more urgent and the use of visual aids such as headlines and images become more prominent. The interview concludes with a call to action for viewers to tune in to Novara's live coverage, indicating that the focus has shifted towards promoting their own platform. Therefore, the answer would be A: It opens with enthusiastic ground campaigning, as outdoor canvassing and badges accompany praise for a “phenomenal army” and knocking every door. In the pub, the tone turns reflective then confident as Owen admits he was wrong and explains an inspiring vision, before playfully dissecting press narratives while Sun, Mail, and Guardian headlines appear. It culminates in urgent get-out-the-vote appeals with animated gestures and ends on branded outro screens inviting viewers to Novara’s live coverage.",

    "model_answer": "A: He moves from describing a huge, youthful first-time “army” of volunteers to acknowledging his earlier doubts were wrong. As the conversation progresses, he references the Guardian headline that appears, which likely reinforces his changing views on the campaign’s success. He then pivots to concrete voter turnout efforts, asking viewers to take specific actions like messaging friends and finding target areas. Finally, he signs off by directing viewers to watch Novara’s all-night coverage, implying that this will be crucial for the outcome of the campaign.\n\nTherefore, option A best describes how Owen Jones’s stance evolves over the course of the discussion, as it reflects his changing perception of the campaign’s progress and his calls to action for viewers.",

    "model_answer": "B: She expresses willingness and even enthusiasm to take on parks if assigned. When the parksâ€™ financial problems are raised, she frames it as a basic maintenance and repair failure similar to roadways, and she finally points to general obligation bonds as a stable, viable funding source.\n\nEudaly initially seems interested in taking on parks oversight, but when the funding issue arises, she shifts her focus to privatization and user fees as the solution. This indicates a change in her stance regarding parks funding. However, she still advocates for using general obligation bonds as a stable funding source, which shows her commitment to finding a long-term solution for parks funding.",

    "model_answer": "The narrative developed as follows:\n\n- Initially, Imran Khan portrays himself as under attack from the police and alleges that they are attempting to arrest him without probable cause. He also mentions that his lawyer has assured him of his safety and that he is willing to appear in court despite the ongoing unrest.\n- As the interview progresses, the situation escalates with the mention of tear gas, water cannons, and other forms of police violence. Khan emphasizes that he is facing numerous cases but has always acted within the bounds of the law.\n- When asked about his repeated failures to appear in court, Khan suggests that these misses are due to bomb threats and inadequate security measures rather than a lack of willingness to comply with the law.\n- Finally, Khan hints at a possible connection between the police operation and previous attempts on his life, suggesting that the government may be trying to silence him through intimidation and harassment.\n\nTherefore, option A best captures the development of Imran Khan's narrative throughout the live interview and cutaway sequences.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: She is first introduced under a Green Party canopy as Angela Walker’s assistant, then recounts moving from a Bernie supporter to discovering Jill Stein through meme communities and connecting with the Green Party. She later identifies herself as running a Hawkins meme stash and working on the national campaign, finally pivoting to youth empowerment and a call-to-action that includes a Gretzky quote about taking shots. The steady visuals of the H2O Hawkins shirt, the Green Party Washington banner, and her increasingly animated gestures under the tent reinforce this progression.\nThe audio clip reveals that Ashley starts by working as an assistant to Angela Walker, which indicates her involvement with the Green Party.

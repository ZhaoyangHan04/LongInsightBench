    "model_answer": "The narrative starts with an introduction about Kodokan-linked “lost” techniques which hints at the focus on old techniques. As the video progresses, the focus shifts towards contemporary demonstrations and analysis of throws, indicating a move away from just discussing the old techniques. The concluding remarks invite readers to read a Kodokan article, tying the historical context to present-day practice, which brings the discussion full circle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.",

    "model_answer": "The answer should be based on the visual aids provided in the video. Please describe what you see in the video regarding the treatment of side sacrifice and related throws (e.g., Yokowakare/Yokogake family) across the middle of the video.\n\nThe correct answer would be A: The topic is framed through a historical and technical comparison, with the speaker calling it a sacrificing throw and contrasting it to Sumi Gaeshi before promising to show Yokowakare. It then shifts to a labeled modern O-Yoko-Wakare demo with clear footwork and arm cues, followed by competition footage where he contrasts it with Yokogake. Finally, it is connected to Nage-no-kata and presented with variations and randori (even nogi) applicability, situating the throw within both kata and live practice.",

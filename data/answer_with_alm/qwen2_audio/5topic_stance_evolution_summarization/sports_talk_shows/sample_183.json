    "model_answer": "The answer is A: He opens by excitedly praising how savage Drew has been after the Punk segment. As he shows on-screen tweets and the gym TikTok—gravestone meme, Jordan laugh, and “Never skip tricep day”—his tone swings between shocked and amused, insisting Drew “must be stopped” while clearly entertained. He closes by arguing the disrespect is working, calling Drew possibly the biggest heel right now and inviting viewers to weigh in.\n\nThroughout the video, the speaker's tone evolves from admiration to frustration, highlighting the changing public perception of Drew McIntyre. Despite showing initial excitement about Drew's behavior, the speaker becomes increasingly critical of the idea that respect should be earned through social media stunts. By the end of the video, the speaker seems to accept that Drew's behavior has indeed had an impact on his character perception, leading him to apologize for his earlier criticism and urge fans to support Drew's redemption arc.",

    "model_answer": "The video develops its theme of kayfabe bleeding into social media through several means. Firstly, the commentator discusses how wrestlers are using social media to push their storylines, which sets the stage for the rest of the segment. Then, the commentator shows a series of examples from Drew's social media accounts, including memes and TikToks, to illustrate the extent to which kayfabe has seeped into these platforms. The tone of the commentator becomes increasingly intense as he discusses the negative impact that this is having on the perception of wrestling and the need to stop Drew's behavior. However, despite his concerns, the commentator also acknowledges the effectiveness of Drew's character work and the fact that he is a top heel in the industry. Therefore, option C best captures the overall development of the video's theme.",

While acknowledging their past successes and current standing, the commentary also highlights the incredible talent and potential of younger wrestlers, suggesting that it may be difficult for veterans likeAJ Styles, Sheamus, Strowman, and Kofi to win another world title. This perspective is supported by the visual elements of the video, which show belt images and countdowns, but also emphasize the importance of newer stars in the WWE roster. Overall, the video presents a balanced view of the current state of the WWE and the future direction of the company.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: It starts critical of Mickie James but then defends WWE’s choices for Big Boss Man by insisting he had clear creative direction. From there, it portrays RVD’s comeback as mostly neutral before crediting Nash’s angle as effective long-term storytelling. The stance shifts from skepticism to endorsement by the final segment.\nThe video starts by criticizing Mickie James' treatment upon her return to TV, highlighting that she was presented as a legitimate legend despite previous disrespect shown towards her. This sets a negative tone for the section.\nHowever, when discussing Big Boss Man's run in 2001, the video presents it as solidly booked, suggesting that WWE had a clear plan for his character. This shift in perspective could be seen as an attempt to defend WWE's booking decisions at the time.\nWhen RVD returns, the video presents it as mostly neutral, which could indicate that WWE did not have a clear idea of what they wanted to do with him. However, when discussing Nash's angle involving CM Punk and Triple H, the video credits it as effective long-term storytelling, indicating that WWE may have found success with this approach.\nOverall, the video seems to suggest that WWE has learned from their past mistakes and has become better at managing comebacks over time",

    "model_answer": "The video develops its overarching argument about ill-fated comebacks through a combination of ranked graphics/interview visuals and the narrator's commentary. Initially, the countdown graphic for Mr. Perfect sets a nostalgic yet critical tone, highlighting his decline following his plane incident. As the video progresses, the segments on Kurt Angle, Batista, and Ultimate Warrior show how poor timing and booking can undermine even the most promising comebacks. The Warrior segment further emphasizes this point by framing him as a troubled rehire who struggled to live up to expectations. Finally, the split-screen Grilling JR interview reinforces the idea that fans should be skeptical of comeback stories, especially if they involve wrestlers who have previously struggled.\nTherefore, the correct answer would be A: The countdown graphic for Mr. Perfect sets a retrospective critique that shows him sliding into Sunday Night Heat and exiting after the plane incident. The Angle segment tempers fan hopes with talk of injuries and a disappointing final match, while the Batista section argues that bad timing and booking undermined his return despite the prominent ranking visuals. The Warrior segment frames him as a historically troubled rehire, and the split-screen Grilling JR interview closes by validating the skepticism when JR admits he expected failure.",

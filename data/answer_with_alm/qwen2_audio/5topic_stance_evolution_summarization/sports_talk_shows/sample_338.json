    "model_answer": "A: The show opens by framing a Betting 101 segment, then walks through spread bets before moving to moneyline, totals (over/under), straight (prop) bets, parlays, and finally teasers, concluding with a brief wrap-up. Visually, it alternates between a sweatered host in a stadium-style studio and a suited analyst against a cityscape while a left-side menu of bet types and a persistent promotional banner (with HURRY branding) guide the sequence.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is B: From foundational spread concepts, the conversation pivots into multi-leg structures that raise the upside and the riskâ€”first parlays (better odds if you hit all selections) and then teasers (moving lines while still needing everything to cash). The on-screen menu remains in view and the promotional banner persists as the presenters switch settings, signaling a deliberate progression from simpler to riskier plays.\n\nThroughout the audio, the presenters discuss various bet types, starting with the money line where favorites cost more while underdogs can return more. Then they move on to parlays that offer better odds if all legs hit. As they progress, they introduce teasers that allow bettors to adjust the point spread or total score by six or seven points, which offers higher payout potential but also increases the risk. The visuals used throughout the presentation include the stadium and city sets, as well as the bet-type menu and the HURRY banner, which reinforces the stakes and the urgency of making a bet.",

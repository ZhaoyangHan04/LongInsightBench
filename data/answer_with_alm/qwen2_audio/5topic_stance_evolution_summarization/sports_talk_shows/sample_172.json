    "model_answer": "The narrator's stance and the video's tone evolve from anticipation to reaction to reflection. This is evident through the changes in the narrator's language and the visual elements used in the video. Initially, the narrator describes the night as incredible and sets up the expectation of a historic moment. As the ball is hit and flies into the stands, the tone becomes more chaotic and frenzied, reflecting the excitement of the moment. However, after the initial rush, the narrator takes a step back and reflects on the significance of the moment, considering the implications of Judge's 60th home run. This shift in tone is reflected in the video through the use of different camera angles and shot sizes. Overall, the video captures the intensity of the moment but also allows for reflection on its meaning.",

    "model_answer": "The narrative evolves from speculative to definitive. Initially, the speaker discusses Onana's departure from Ajax, raising questions about Chelsea's plans for their goalkeeper position. As the video progresses, visual aids such as tweets and images are shown, suggesting that Chelsea has indeed signed Onana and that he will be the starting goalkeeper. By the end of the video, the speaker seems certain about Chelsea's decision, dismissing any doubts or concerns about the transfer. Therefore, the most appropriate option would be B: The speaker starts skeptical, but mid-video he confirms that Onana to Chelsea is a done deal.",

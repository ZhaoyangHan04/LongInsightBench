    "model_answer": "A: It starts by reporting that WWE may relax language limits, showing a taped-on quote about balancing edgier content with sponsors while the host questions how far talent can go. The show then spotlights champions’ victory-lap promos that resonated with fans, implying a bolder tone. It culminates with Cody’s SmackDown promo line, “Who the hell told you tonight was open mic night, bitch?”, presented as a concrete example of edgier language making it to air.\n\nThe episode develops its view on WWE’s language tone by starting with a discussion about potential changes in policy regarding the use of certain words and phrases. This sets the stage for a look at how the company's language is reflected in their programming. The show then uses visual aids such as champion's victory-lap promos to demonstrate that WWE is willing to take risks with more edgy content. However, when the focus shifts to on-air examples, the episode presents a concrete example of edgier language making it to air through Cody's promo line. This helps to illustrate the company's inconsistent approach to language and censorship. Overall, the episode provides a nuanced view of WWE's language policies and practices.",

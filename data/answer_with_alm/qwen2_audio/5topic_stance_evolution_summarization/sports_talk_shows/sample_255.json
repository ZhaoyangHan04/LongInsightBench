    "model_answer": "The momentum between Pacquiao and Margarito evolves from the start where both fighters appear evenly matched, but as the fight progresses, Margarito starts to take over and gain momentum. This is reflected visually through Margarito's increased activity and range, as well as Pacquiao's defensive movements and the referee's attention. However, in the later stages of the fight, Pacquiao manages to regain momentum with a late rally, which is mirrored by the crowd's reaction and the doctors' intervention. Therefore, option B best describes the evolution of momentum in the fight.",

    "model_answer": "The creator's stance and tone evolve from his opening reaction through the on-screen confirmations to his later reflection and sign-off as follows:\n\n- Initially, he bursts out celebrating in his sneaker-filled studio, loudly cheering that Vince is gone. This indicates a positive and perhaps overly enthusiastic reaction to the news.\n- As he continues reading and joking on-screen tweets and an official statement, his tone becomes more mixed. There is still a sense of excitement and triumph, but also a hint of incredulity and sarcasm, especially with the \"gleeful 'you're fired' aside.\"\n- However, after this initial celebration, the tone becomes more serious and somber. He speaks more deliberately and with a greater sense of gravity about power dynamics and uncertainty. This shift in tone suggests that he has come to realize the broader implications of the situation beyond just the immediate outcome.\n- Finally, when he returns to a triumphant send-off with another emphatic \"You're fired!\" it seems that he has fully accepted the news and is now focused on celebrating the end of what he sees as a negative chapter in his life or career.\n\nTherefore, option A best describes the creator's evolving stance and tone throughout the audio clip.",

    "model_answer": "The speaker's argument builds as he starts by discussing the sponsor's reaction to the situation, which he believes triggered board caution. He then goes on to discuss the likelihood of returns and future partnerships, stating that the sponsor's risk \"messed up the money.\" The speaker also mentions that he put official resignation materials on screen and read from them, indicating that the situation has affected the company financially. He also talks about the potential ripple effects of the situation, such as talent departures, and suggests that a brand might sponsor again in the future.\nTherefore, the correct answer would be A: He first credits a sponsorâ€™s pullback for triggering board caution, saying it set off a chain of events. He then puts official resignation materials on screen and reads from them, before arguing that sponsor risk \"messed up the money,\" making any comeback unlikely until things are cleared. He stresses TKO is money-first and foresees ripple effects like talent departures, while also floating that a brand might sponsor again.",

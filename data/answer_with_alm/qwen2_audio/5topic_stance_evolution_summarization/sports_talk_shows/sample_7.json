He then brings in Swiss Ramble charts and external financing graphs to argue money is leaving via dividends and interest, comparing United unfavorably to rivals as his tone grows angrier. He culminates with an explicit activist appeal and profanity, paired with protest imagery including a banner accusing the owners of stealing over £1B.",

    "model_answer": "The presenter develops his argument by starting with a discussion on the successful teams that Manchester United has had under their ownership, highlighting the importance of the owners in building those teams. He then uses data from Swiss Ramble to show that despite these successes, the club has been making large outflows through interest and dividends. The presenter also mentions that the Glazers have been accused of being thieves by fans for the way they manage the club. The presentation includes overlays and tweets that support this argument, and the tone becomes increasingly angry as the speaker discusses the financial situation of the club. Finally, the speaker calls on fans to take action and protest against the way the club is being run. Overall, the presentation presents a critical view of the Glazer's ownership and its impact on the financial success and stability of Manchester United.",

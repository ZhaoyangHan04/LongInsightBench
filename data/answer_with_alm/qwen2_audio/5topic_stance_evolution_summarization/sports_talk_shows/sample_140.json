    "model_answer": "The speaker's stance develops from initially defending UTMB and dismissing concerns about it, to acknowledging problems with UTMB's leadership and the need for change. He also recognizes the potential for other events to grow and suggests that UTMB should consider their position in the industry. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be A: He opens by raising the elites’ call-to-action and ongoing controversies, then shows community backlash and UTMB’s response alongside the firing of a commentator. He introduces the World Trail Majors and reads an email proposing that top runners race elsewhere while crediting UTMB’s role in growing the sport. He finally tempers expectations, noting sponsor influence and concluding with a balanced plea for transparency and positive change rather than outright abandonment.",

    "model_answer": "B: After showing community backlash and UTMB’s media response, the speaker acknowledges the main event’s role in elevating the sport. He invites elites to leverage their influence by racing alternatives, but later highlights sponsor realities and becomes measured and reformist, seeking transparency and improvement rather than destruction. The overall arc moves from critique to pragmatic pressure.",

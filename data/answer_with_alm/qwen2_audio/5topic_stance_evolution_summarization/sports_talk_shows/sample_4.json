    "model_answer": "The answer should be based on the analysis of the audio provided. \n\nThe audio starts off by highlighting 'the good' aspects of SmackDown, such as the beatdown on The Bloodline and babyfaces getting payback. The commentary also acknowledges the positive reception of the André the Giant Battle Royal. However, the commentary also includes negative feedback on the execution of the Battle Royal and the state of the show leading up to WrestleMania. As the show progresses, the commentary becomes increasingly critical of the hype surrounding WrestleMania, describing it as overblown and unfulfilled. Therefore, the show's Good/Bad/Ugly framing evolves from celebration to criticism, with a clear emphasis on the negative aspects of SmackDown and WrestleMania hype. Option A best captures this evolution in the audio's commentary.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: He starts by tempering expectations with “TRIPLE H PREPARING US FOR THE WORST,” and the audio notes fans may nitpick but “it’s never the end.” He then pivots to media strategy, with visuals reading “WWE PLEAS ON NETFLIX?” and Peacock/WWE logos as the narration quotes discussion of Raw rights and future interest in PLEs on Netflix. Finally, visuals confirm “TRiple H CONFIRMS WWE DRAFT” and a Draft logo with “A NEW ERA IS COMING…,” while the audio says a draft is coming in a month or so and “you ain't seen nothing yet.”\n\nThis trajectory shows that Triple H initially prepares the audience for a letdown or negative reception to his announcements, but then shifts gears to discuss potential media partnerships and strategic moves for the company. This includes confirming the existence of a draft, which implies a major change in the direction of the company. The visuals used during this segment further emphasize these developments, showing the company's relationship with Netflix and the drafting process. Overall, the message seems to be focused on the future direction of the company and its plans for growth and expansion.",

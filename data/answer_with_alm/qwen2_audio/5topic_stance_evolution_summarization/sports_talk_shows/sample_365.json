    "model_answer": "The evolution of stoppages and fight safety is evident from the beginning to the end of the reel. In the early stages, commentators immediately declare stoppages when necessary, such as when a fighter is unable to continue due to injury or when the referee steps in. As the fight progresses, the commentary shifts towards analyzing the techniques used by the fighters and their defense mechanisms. There is also a mention of the judges' decision-making process and the possibility of a commission介入.\nAs the fight reaches its climax, the audio becomes more focused on the outcome, with explicit graphics indicating the final score and the number of rounds won. The commentary highlights the quick and decisive nature of some of the fights, emphasizing the importance of safety and the referee's role in ensuring that the fight is conducted safely.\nTherefore, option C best describes the evolution of stoppages and fight safety across the reel, as it captures the various stages of the fight and the changing emphasis on safety and the referee's role.",

As the debate heats up, on-screen chat messages back her (“Ashley goin in,” “FACTS ASH”), and she doubles down with sharp analogies.

The show then explicitly invites an audience verdict, with on-screen prompts and a live chat ticker that sides with Ashley’s tougher position. The visual headers and call-in graphics underscore an interactive format that culminates in that audience-leaning outcome.",

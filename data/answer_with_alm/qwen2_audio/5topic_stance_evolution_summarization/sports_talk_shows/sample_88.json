They assign roles like the broom expert versus the unsure trash-can holder, critiquing technique while gesturing and pointing to the clip.

    "model_answer": "The show's topic and tone evolve from their initial sports framing into later, more whimsical stories across the episode by selecting option A. As the episode progresses, they incorporate various segments such as a raccoon incident, body humor, and a \"Balloon Man\" segment that are increasingly whimsical and unrelated to sports. This shift in focus is indicated by the change in on-screen text and descriptors, as well as the hosts' reactions being animated.",

    "model_answer": "The tone shifts from event hype to talent updates and story direction as the video progresses through various segments. Initially, there's an emphasis on the Elimination Chamber promotion, with the host hyping up the event and the promise of exciting moments. As the video continues, however, it becomes clear that the focus has shifted towards updates on individual talents, such as Undertaker's tweet and Shotzi's injury. The mood also softens as the news about Shotzi's injury is delivered, indicating a more serious and empathetic tone. Finally, the video ends with a discussion of Roxanne Perez's actions, which seems to be leading to a new storyline development. Overall, the video maintains a celebratory tone but adjusts its focus and tone based on the developments in the story.",

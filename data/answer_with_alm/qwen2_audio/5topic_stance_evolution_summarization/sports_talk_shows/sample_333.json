    "model_answer": "The answer is A: The show frames the PWHL clip with \"FIRST EVER OT!\" as the host enthusiastically analyzes the decisive sequence, then pivots via a sponsor read into \"TAG + WRESTLING = KABADDI\" where he explains rules and urges viewers to watch. It then shifts to \"THE HEAVE! FAN OF THE WEEK\" for a wild college finish before ending with the hostâ€™s on-camera prompt to pick a Fan of the Week, shown in a split-screen ballot.\nThis option accurately captures how the show's thematic focus develops across different segments. The opening segment sets up the discussion around overtime in hockey, which leads into a segment about kabaddi, a sport that is presented as a variant of wrestling. This segment includes a rule explanation and encourages viewers to watch more of the sport. The final segment features a call-out for fans to vote on their favorite moment of the week, which is presented in a split-screen format with the host's on-screen prompt.\nTherefore, option A provides the most comprehensive and accurate summary of the show's thematic development across different sports and segments.",

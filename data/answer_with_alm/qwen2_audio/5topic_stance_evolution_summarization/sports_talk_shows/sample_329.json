    "model_answer": "B: It starts by crediting Draymond’s clutch defense in the Suns finish, as heard when the narrator says his clamps sealed the deal while the game-winning visuals roll. Then the narrative confronts outside criticism and Draymond’s own defiant replies, shown via a locker-room clip and an on-screen tweet attacking his character. Finally, Curry’s postgame praise and a graphic highlighting Draymond’s strong plus/minus and calmer demeanor reframe him positively in the studio segment.",

    "model_answer": "B: The narrative opens by anticipating mainstream pushback even as game highlights roll, then cites an on-air example of bias during the Suns matchup. It escalates by visually displaying tweets that first claim “KD is better than Curry” and then show Durant praising Curry, while the host vocally dismantles the anti-Curry narrative. It ends by broadening the critique to officiating inconsistencies (flopping, hacking, questionable calls) and even invites viewer engagement alongside on-screen leaderboard and venue shots.",

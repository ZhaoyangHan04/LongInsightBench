    "model_answer": "The narrative develops as the hosts introduce negative draft profiles and then move on to players' reactions. Each player reacts differently to the criticism, with some laughing it off, while others take it more seriously. The conversation eventually leads to Kirk Cousins discussing how he has learned to use the criticism as motivation. The hosts also advise players to not let negative feedback get to them. Therefore, option A is the closest answer.",

    "model_answer": "The tone and focus shift as the conversation moves from a specific quarterback's report to broader reflections on scouting and self-assessment when the second speaker interjects with their own thoughts on Russell Wilson's draft profile, leading into a discussion about drafting players based on their size and arm strength. This marks the beginning of a broader reflection on scouting and self-assessment within the context of football drafting. As the conversation progresses, it becomes clear that the hosts are engaging in a mock draft and discussing various traits that are important for NFL players, such as arm strength, throwing ability, and physical attributes. They also touch upon the challenges of scouting and evaluating players, particularly when relying solely on statistics and scouting reports. The conversation concludes with a reflective mood, as indicated by the soft background music and the on-screen subscribe prompt.",

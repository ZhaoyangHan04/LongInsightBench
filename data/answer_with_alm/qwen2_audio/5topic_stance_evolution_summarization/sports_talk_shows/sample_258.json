    "model_answer": "The answer is A: It begins with middle players combining to pass quickly to a free target to score. Progressions then allow target-to-target passes to count as a goal while middle players react and support, with target players choosing the best passing option. Finally, it becomes a competition to accumulate the most successful passes, with target and middle players rotating positions to keep play flowing.\nThe audio describes a soccer drill where initially, players find a friend with two progressions, and the ball is passed from a target player to one of the middle players who then passes it back to a free target player. This sets up a basic understanding of passing and receiving in soccer. As the drill progresses, target-to-target passes become worth points, indicating a development in the game's complexity. Middle players also start reacting and supporting the target player, and eventually, target and middle players rotate positions to keep the game flowing. This indicates a progression towards a more competitive phase of the drill where the focus shifts to accumulating successful passes.",

    "model_answer": "The audio describes how the coaching cues and tactical emphasis progress from the early 2v2 sequences to the Four Corners possession game in a soccer training session. \n\nIn the early stages of the session, when playing 2v2, the focus is on finding friends with two progressions, which likely means passing combinations. As the session progresses, the emphasis shifts to more advanced techniques such as shooting under pressure. This change is evident when the session moves on to the Four Corners possession game, where the emphasis is on dribbling duels and long-range shots rather than maintaining possession or supporting angles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be A) The focus shifts from passing combinations to shooting technique and finishing under pressure. By the Four Corners stage, the drill emphasizes 1v1 dribbling duels and long-range shots rather than maintaining possession or supporting angles.",

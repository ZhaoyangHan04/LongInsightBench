    "model_answer": "The speaker's stance and tone evolve from amused approval of Khabib’s outburst to a stern condemnation of the bus incident, then offers sharp criticism of Conor’s in-cage conduct before exploring a more nuanced interpretation of “it’s only business.” On camera, he remains composed in the formal promotional setting, but his facial expressions and head turns show he’s fielding pointed questions from multiple reporters as the tone moves from light to serious and reflective.

As the talk progresses, he insists he must beat Kevin, cites advantages like cardio and longer time, and closes by reaffirming he absolutely has to win and feels good about the fight.

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: He critiques popular flatter race saddles for provoking pelvic alignment and spinal flexion issues while handling test saddles on camera. He then says most customers succeed with flatter saddles that include a relief channel, challenges sit-bone-width calculators (noting 152 can be too wide), and pushes back on noseless-forward aero marketing. He concludes by favoring traditional flat saddles for everyday riders and reserving noseless TT designs for tri/time-trial positions.\n\nThe presenter starts by criticizing the common issue with flatter race saddles, which is causing problems with pelvic alignment and spinal flexion. He then mentions that most customers have success with saddles that include a relief channel. This indicates that he believes in the importance of pressure relief in saddles. Furthermore, he challenges the widely used sit-bone-width calculator and suggests that it may be too narrow for some people.

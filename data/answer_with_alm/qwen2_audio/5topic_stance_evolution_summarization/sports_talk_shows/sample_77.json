    "model_answer": "The speaker's views on training environments and timing develop as follows:\n\n- In the beginning, he emphasizes the importance of starting young and being part of a school team because it provides a unique and competitive environment that is crucial for developing skills (Option A).\n- As the speech progresses, he acknowledges that not everyone can afford to start young and suggests that晚加入者 might still benefit from joining a gym (Option C). However, he also warns that these gyms may not have the same level of competition as school teams (Option B).\n- Towards the end of the speech, the speaker reinforces the idea of starting young and encourages those who are on the fence to take the leap (Option C).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be C: He builds from a foundation-first message to a candid pep talk for late starters, then explains that the irreplaceable, competitive environment of school teams beats the looser commitment of MMA gyms. The camera stays on his animated delivery and constant overlays while he warns that people are actively trying to take your spot. He caps it by telling listeners to do it young if possible and addressing those on the fence.",

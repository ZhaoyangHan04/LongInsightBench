    "model_answer": "The video's stance evolves from initially questioning the wisdom of Curry's benching to defending it based on improved team performance. This shift is evident through the use of metrics such as fourth-quarter minutes played and efficiency ratings, which support the idea that Curry's benching was justified. Additionally, the video also acknowledges the concerns raised about Curry's ankle injury and load management as potential factors in his benching. Ultimately, the video seems to conclude that while there may be differing opinions on Curry's benching, the decision was likely made with the intention of protecting his long-term health.",

    "model_answer": "The video develops its broader argument by starting with Curry's and a teammate's accounts of punitive fourth-quarter benchings, showing how Curry faced challenges due to his coach's lack of belief in him. This is followed by a critique of hostile environments and poor coaching that can derail the development of young stars. The video contrasts Curry's situation with that of De Marcus Cousins, who despite facing similar challenges, managed to secure late-game minutes. The video also presents visual evidence of Cousins' achievements and stable minutes as proof that harsh treatment can improve outcomes. However, it is important to note that the video does not conclude that Curry would have benefited from more benching as well. Instead, it suggests that limited fourth-quarter minutes may be a common policy for young stars on losing teams. Overall, the video presents a nuanced view of the impact of coaching and environments on young stars, rather than presenting a simple black-and-white solution.",

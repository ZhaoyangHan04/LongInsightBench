In interviews, Mayo acknowledges that Jordan is the best and that it was fun to play against him.

    "model_answer": "The framing of 'trash talk' evolves from being initially dismissed as not trash by one speaker, to being challenged and ultimately accepted by Jordan as part of the competitive banter. This evolution is reflected in the dialogue where Jordan's initial statement about being the greatest is met with hesitation, but later on, through his actions and words, he embraces the challenge and the concept of trash talk as part of the game. By the end, the speakers seem to have reached a resolution and accept each other's perspective on the matter. Therefore, the answer would be A.",

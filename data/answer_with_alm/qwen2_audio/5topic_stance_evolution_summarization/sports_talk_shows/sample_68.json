    "model_answer": "The answer is A: It starts by visually labeling the offense (offensive line, quarterback, running backs, receivers) while the narration explains each role and even concludes that section with “That’s offense.” The focus then shifts on-screen to defensive formations like 4-3 and 3-4 as the speaker explains linemen, linebackers, and defensive backs. Finally, the visuals and commentary move to special teams, showing kickers and listing specialist roles to wrap up the team’s third phase.\nThe video starts by focusing on the offense, which is labeled and explained in detail. This provides a clear understanding of the positions and responsibilities of the offensive unit. As the video progresses, it moves on to discuss the defense, starting with diagrams and explanations of the different positions such as cornerbacks and safeties. The focus then shifts back to the offense, specifically the offensive line, before moving on to special teams. The visual aids used in the video help to reinforce the concepts being discussed, making it easier for viewers to follow along.",

    "model_answer": "The diagram and narration suggest that the offense starts with a fixed set-up but becomes more flexible as the game progresses. This is indicated by the progression from a basic offensive line setup to more complex schemes like the 4-3 and 3-4 defenses. Additionally, special teams also have specialized roles, but players can switch between these roles, indicating some level of flexibility. Therefore, option A seems to be the most accurate answer.",

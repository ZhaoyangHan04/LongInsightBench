    "model_answer": "The speaker starts by discussing the Double Leg Dive/Morote-gari, followed by the double wristlock grip. In his closing remarks, he acknowledges that there may be uncertainty about some details regarding no-gi and Russian tie techniques and invites feedback. Therefore, the correct answer would be A: He first revisits the classic double leg from old manuals and modern practice, then critiques its efficiency and finishing routes. The narrative then elevates the double wristlock grip as an underrated, versatile tool for takedowns, pins, and submissions, with examples, before he admits uncertainty about some no-gi and Russian tie details and invites feedback.",

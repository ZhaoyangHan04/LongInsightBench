    "model_answer": "The portrayal of record-distance field goal attempts evolves from the opening framing through the later sequences as follows:\n\nA) The video opens by framing a compilation of 64+ yard misses and then strings together record-chasing tries that fail in different ways, with commentary calling out blocks, uprights, and short kicks. As the attempts stretch to 66–69 yards, the audio shifts from hyped “record” talk to analytical notes about wind and distance, while visuals repeatedly show end-of-half setups and hurried long attempts.\n\nTherefore, option A best describes this evolution in the portrayal of record-distance field goal attempts.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Commentators consistently frame misses and blocks as live-ball opportunities, spotlighting returners battling for yards yet usually falling short. The visuals track runners weaving after blocks or short kicks, while the audio emphasizes \"still on his feet\" and even \"miracle\" attempts that ultimately come up short.\n\nThe commentary in the audio reflects this stance by describing various plays as opportunities for the return team to make something happen. For example, when a long field goal try is missed, the commentary highlights the chance for a returner to take it back and potentially score. Even when blocks occur, the commentary notes the potential for a return if the player can catch the ball and advance it forward. This perspective is consistent throughout the audio, providing a balanced view of both the positive and negative aspects of each play.",

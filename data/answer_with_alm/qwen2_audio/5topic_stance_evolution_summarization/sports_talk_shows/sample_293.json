    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: He opens by explaining thumb taping for ulnar-side injuries and says heâ€™ll show elastic first, then rigid if needed. He then demonstrates elastic taping from the wrist around the thenar eminence with overlapping layers, showing the wrap on camera. Later he adds rigid reinforcement from the back of the ulna with longer strips kept flat, cautioning not to over-tighten for circulation and locking it off even if it looks messy.\n\nThe audio clip starts with the instructor discussing how to tape the thumb, specifically for those with ulnar-sided injuries. He mentions that they will start with elastic sports tape and then demonstrate how to use rigid tape if necessary. The instructor then proceeds to tape the thumb using elastic tape, starting from the wrist and wrapping around the thenar eminence with overlapping layers. He shows the wrap on camera before moving on to add rigid reinforcement from the back of the ulna using longer strips that are kept flat. The instructor cautions against over-tightening the tape for circulation and warns that it should be locked off even if it looks messy.",

    "model_answer": "The presenter starts by contrasting his uninjured and injured thumbs, explaining the injury mechanism, setting the need for support. He then promotes elastic self-taping for minor issues when a therapist isn't available, and later escalates to rigid tape for more persistent or tendon-related problems with cautions about circulation and function over looks. He concludes by situating the methods within sports-related collateral ligament/MCP injuries and signs off. Therefore, the correct answer would be A.",

    "model_answer": "The speaker's assignment of blame evolves from the opening through his later remarks as follows:\n\n- In the opening, he expresses explosive outrage over an embarrassing loss to a winless opponent, targeting the entire team, including the coaching staff, and describing the situation as \"douchebagery.\"\n- As the speech progresses, he expands his criticism to specific individuals on the team, such as a player who made a failed tackle and the broader units and staff.\n- By the end of the speech, when he tells everyone to take the day off, he includes coaches and himself in the condemnation, stating that the whole thing stinks.\n- The unchanging Giants backdrop and his increasingly animated gestures suggest that his anger and frustration grow over time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: He opens with explosive outrage over an embarrassing loss to a winless opponent, then narrows his anger to calling out a specific playerâ€™s failed tackle and the broader units and staff. By the time he tells everyone to take the day off, he includes coaches and himself in the condemnation, saying the whole thing stinks. The unchanging Giants backdrop and his increasingly animated gestures underscore the escalation.",

    "model_answer": "The speaker starts off with intense criticism and anger, but as the speech progresses, his tone becomes more subdued and serious. This is evident when he mentions taking the rest of the day off and the negative feedback he has received. However, towards the end of the speech, the speaker's tone becomes more authoritative and stern as he orders someone out of the locker room. This shift in tone can be attributed to the speaker's increasing frustration and anger towards the situation.",

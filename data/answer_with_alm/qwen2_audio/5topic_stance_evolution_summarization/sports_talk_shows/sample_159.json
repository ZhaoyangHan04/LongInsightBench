    "model_answer": "The conception and purpose of the Natural Selection effort evolves from a low-key local jam with no defined identity to a larger, more public-facing project focused on street culture. This evolution is evident through the changes in the visuals, the addition of dates and a website, and the shift in tone from self-contained to more outward-looking. By the end of the film, the project has shifted even further away from its original mountain format and towards a focus on urban settings. However, there is no indication that the project was ever shelved or that there were concerns about safety that led to its cancellation. Therefore, options D (Initial hype quickly gives way to concern, and organizers decide to shelve the idea before any event happens) does not seem to be supported by the evidence presented in the audio and question.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: The stance evolves from uncertainty about blind approaches to conviction that the snow is good and this is going to be on, accompanied by hard-driving music and footage of clean airs. This is evident from the early discussions and preparations, where riders are cautious and discussing their plans. However, as the day progresses, the mood changes, and the group starts to have more fun and enjoy themselves, leading to a sense of community and celebration. The commentary also reflects this shift, moving away from strict competition and towards a more positive and uplifting tone. Overall, the visuals and commentary show a group of people having a great time riding and enjoying each other's company.",

    "model_answer": "A: The segment begins with confidence and hype from Garnett’s side while the game is tight, and Michael Jordan clearly hears it. After that, a chaotic stretch follows with multiple mistakes and a big swing in momentum, leading to a hard lesson and the admission to never talk to Mike like that again.\n\nThe audio clip describes how Kevin Garnett trash talked Michael Jordan during his rookie year, provoking him as a rookie in the league. This led to a chaotic stretch in the game where both teams made mistakes and the momentum shifted significantly. Jordan missed key shots, and the Timberwolves pulled away, winning the game. Garnett later admitted that he regretted talking to Jordan like that and apologized. \n\nTherefore, option A correctly summarizes the events described in the audio clip and the game's momentum evolution after the courtside trash talk.",

    "model_answer": "The video's portrayal evolves from early Bulls-era nostalgia to later reflections and Wizards-era analysis through its use of on-screen visuals and narration-commentary. It starts with footage and commentary from the all-time greats' interview on Showtime with Matt Barkley and Stephen Jackson, discussing Garnett trash-talking Jordan when he was a rookie in the league. Afterward, the video breaks down another story involving MJ and Garnett later in Garnett's career. As the video progresses, it moves into a discussion about Jordan's competitive spirit and how it evolved over time, focusing particularly on his games against the Minnesota Timberwolves (Wizards) with footage and analysis from Wizards players and analysts. The video ends by underscoring Jordan's lasting greatness. Therefore, the correct answer is C: The arc shifts from historical Bulls clips and a live-style interview praising KG, to analysis that MJ respected him yet still sought the challenge in Washington. Timberwolves–Wizards visuals back this up while narration asserts MJ’s killer mentality, before the outro invites support and highlights his enduring greatness.",

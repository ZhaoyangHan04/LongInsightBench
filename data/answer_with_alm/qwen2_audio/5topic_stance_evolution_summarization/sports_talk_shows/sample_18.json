    "model_answer": "The narrator's stance evolves from initially praising Flo-Jo's records and treating them as unbreakable to acknowledging that there are new fastest women in the world and that Florence Griffith-Joyner's records could potentially be broken. This evolution is evident through the narrator's commentary and the inclusion of footage of other athletes, such as Richardson and Jackson. Therefore, the correct answer would be A: The video opens by venerating Flo-Jo’s enduring 100m and 200m marks, even calling 10.49 “often considered unbeatable,” while displaying her bio and record overlays. It then pivots to present-day threats, first centering on Richardson’s 10.65 championship record and medal haul with exuberant visuals. The scope widens to Jamaica’s stars and Jackson’s 21.41 dominance in the 200m as the narrator flags multiple contenders. The voiceover finally suggests these records could even fall in Paris as a medal-laden montage rolls.",

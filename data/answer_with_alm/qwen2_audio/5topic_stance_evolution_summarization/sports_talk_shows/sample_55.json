After testing this setup by burning the thread ends and shooting at 30 meters, he notices that his bare shafts are hitting low. Therefore, he decides to move the nocking point down to six millimeters and redo the setup. This shows how his stance on the nocking point placement evolves from an initial estimate to a post-test adjustment based on the results of the testing.",

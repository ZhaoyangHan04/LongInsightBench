    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: After the sleepy morning remarks and rustling inside the tent, dramatic choral music begins while sunrise shots and the labeled Praying Hands rock formation are shown.\n\nThis answer is supported by the audio content which mentions \"sleepy morning remarks\" and \"rustling inside the tent,\" indicating that the speaker is waking up. The audio also mentions \"dramatic choral music,\" which suggests a transition to a different scene or mood. The video then shows sunrise shots and the labeled Praying Hands rock formation, indicating that the video has shifted focus to highlight this location. Therefore, option C accurately describes the sequence of events between 00:03:42.773 and 00:05:08.270 in the video.",

The speaker seems to be discussing the system but does not provide details about the stages or their descriptions.

This combination of details effectively demonstrates both the model's scale (48 million parameters) and the pipeline's efficiency (5 billion runs/day in under 1.5 seconds). Therefore, option A is the correct choice.",

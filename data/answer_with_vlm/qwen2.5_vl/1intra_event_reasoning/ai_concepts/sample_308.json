    "model_answer": "answer: A: To metaphorically frame the Sora announcement as a takeoff, using the cockpit/“Roger” acknowledgment and observation imagery (eye and reflective onlooker) to signal a shift from acknowledgment to looking ahead at societal impact.\n\nThe opening of the segment inside a cockpit labeled \"AIRPLANE,\" followed by the pilots' acknowledgment, suggests a metaphorical takeoff. This is further emphasized by the transition to a close-up eye and a contemplative older man by a city window, which could symbolize looking ahead and reflecting on the societal impact of the announcement. The option A aligns well with these visual cues and the overall narrative structure of the segment.",

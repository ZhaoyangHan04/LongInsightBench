The audio seems to be a transition or title card with text, which does not provide context for the question. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the reason behind the introduction of these elements based solely on this segment.",

The audio content seems to be a continuous speech by the speaker, and there's no mention of visual elements like animations or specific scenes. Therefore, I cannot determine the reason behind such a visual transition based on the given information.",

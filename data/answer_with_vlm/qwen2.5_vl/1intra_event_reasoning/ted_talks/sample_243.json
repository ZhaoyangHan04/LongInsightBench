    "model_answer": "answer: A: That traditional Indigenous practices of collectively sharing songs and knowledge functioned like a decentralized information network.\n\nThe speaker's remark that they were \"the OG inventors of blockchain\" paired with the on-screen imagery and labels about \"Song Lines and sacred sites,\" \"Layout of the land (Song Map),\" and \"Walkabout (a Song – Journey)\" suggests that she is drawing a parallel between traditional Indigenous practices of collectively sharing songs and knowledge and the concept of blockchain as a decentralized information network. The imagery and labels represent aspects of Indigenous culture and land management, which could be seen as analogous to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate conclusion the speaker is inviting the audience to draw.",

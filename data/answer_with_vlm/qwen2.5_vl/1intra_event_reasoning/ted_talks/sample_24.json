The WISC-IV is a cognitive assessment tool used to evaluate various aspects of a person's cognitive abilities. By discussing these tools, the presenter is likely trying to show how students with learning differences can use them to cope with their challenges and perform better in school and during presentations. This connection between practical tools and the topic of learning differences helps the audience understand the importance of these tools in supporting students' academic performance.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A: That boosting abstract reasoning “horsepower” (e.g., via an IQ increase) might actually make one more prone to reasoning failures, so more intelligence doesn’t guarantee better judgment across groups.\n\nThe speaker seems to be making a point about the potential pitfalls of relying solely on increased IQ scores to improve judgment, suggesting that higher intelligence may not necessarily lead to better decision-making abilities. The red “+40 IQ” pill and the “Ordinary Science Intelligence” charts likely represent the idea of artificially boosting intelligence, which the speaker is cautioning against. Therefore, option A best captures the speaker's implied message during this segment.",

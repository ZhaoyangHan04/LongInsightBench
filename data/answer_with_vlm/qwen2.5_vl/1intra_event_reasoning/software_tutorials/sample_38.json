    "model_answer": "Answer: A: The presenter says it’s installed after clicking the install button, and the browser’s extensions page visually shows Ponify listed as enabled.\n\nReasoning: The video confirms the successful installation of the Ponify extension by showing the presenter clicking the install button and then visually verifying that the extension is listed as enabled on the browser's extensions page. This aligns with option A. There is no mention of the confirmation dialog appearing alone (option B), nor is there any indication that the presenter did not proceed to installation (option C). Additionally, the extensions page showing Ponify as enabled (option D) contradicts the presenter's statement that the extension was installed.",

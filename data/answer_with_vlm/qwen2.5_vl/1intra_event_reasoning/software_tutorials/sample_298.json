The segment appears to be a regular Zoom video call where the presenter is speaking directly to the camera. There is no mention of background music, headphones, OBS audio mixer, or any other technical setup that would allow the presenter to monitor and control the audience's music level independently. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine which option, if any, accurately describes the presenter's method.",

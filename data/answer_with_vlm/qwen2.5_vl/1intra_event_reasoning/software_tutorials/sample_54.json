    "model_answer": "The video segment does not provide explicit instructions on how to obtain an accurate FWHM from the highlighted peak within the specified time frame. However, based on the information provided in the video, it seems that the process involves using OriginLab software to perform a fit on the XRD pattern data. The user would likely use the \"Analysis > Peaks and Baselines > Multiple Peak Fit\" option and select a Gaussian function for the fit. This would allow them to obtain the FWHM value as part of the fit parameters.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB: Use Analysis > Peaks and Baselines > Multiple Peak Fit and select a Gaussian function for the fit.\n\nThis option aligns with the typical workflow described in the video, where the user would use OriginLab's peak fitting capabilities to analyze the XRD data and obtain the FWHM value.",

    "model_answer": "The audio segment discusses the fitting process of XRD data using Origin software. The presenter mentions that they have fitted the data with a two-peak Gaussian model and provides FWHM values for each peak. Specifically, the FWHM values reported are approximately 0.199 and 0.21. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: He judges the two-peak Gaussian fit to be pretty good and reports FWHM values of about 0.199 and 0.21.",

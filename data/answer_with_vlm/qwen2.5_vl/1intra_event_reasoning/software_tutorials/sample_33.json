    "model_answer": "The answer is B: Place the R-410A tank upside down on the scale and reset the scale to 0.0 lbs Tare so the exact amount added can be tracked.\n\nThis step is explicitly mentioned in the audio as part of the preparation process before adding refrigerant. The speaker states, \"We're going to place the R-410A tank upside down on the scale and reset the scale to zero so we know exactly how much we're adding.\" This indicates that the purpose of this step is to ensure accurate measurement of the refrigerant being added.",

The target pressure is around 40-42°F/125 PSI on the low side and approximately 15°F above the outdoor temperature on the high side. This method ensures that the system is properly charged and functioning correctly.",

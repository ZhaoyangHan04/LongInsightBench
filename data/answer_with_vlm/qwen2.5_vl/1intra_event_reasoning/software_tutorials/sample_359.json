The purpose of these rectangles is to demonstrate the problem that the tutorial aims to solve, which is breaking up these repeating patterns. Therefore, option A is the most accurate choice among the provided options.",

Then, he compares the result in a split view that includes a new “MicroVariationNoiseMap” label. This demonstrates the improvement in breaking up the tiling textures.",

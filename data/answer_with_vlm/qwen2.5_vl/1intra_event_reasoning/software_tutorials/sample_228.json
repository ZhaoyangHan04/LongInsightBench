    "model_answer": "answer: B: Smooth scrolling disables anchor offsets, so the browser skips rendering headings.\n\nThe speaker explains that the issue is related to smooth scrolling and anchor links. When using smooth scrolling, the browser does not render the headings as they are skipped by the scroll animation. This behavior is typical of smooth scrolling implementations where the browser's default rendering of headings is disabled in favor of a smoother transition. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",

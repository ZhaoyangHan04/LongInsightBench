He explicitly states that he will tackle these promises simultaneously, which includes areas like rule of law, anti-corruption, and human capital. This indicates a comprehensive plan rather than focusing on a single issue.",

    "model_answer": "answer: B: The speaker ties progress to leadership integrity—stating that if the leader is not corrupt, those around him won’t be—while the overlay emphasizes it “just take Good Leadership,” connecting simplicity to leadership-driven solutions.\n\nThe speaker in the video discusses the importance of good leadership in solving Nigeria's problems, emphasizing that corruption is a major issue. The overlay text also supports this by stating that \"just take Good Leadership.\" This suggests that the speaker believes that fixing Nigeria's problems is not complex but rather requires ethical leadership. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer.",

The video content seems to be focused on a woman speaking directly to the camera, and there's no indication of a transition to an Instagram post or any reference to Tina Knowles. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the reason behind the segment cut or the speaker's implied thoughts about Tina Knowles' role based on the given information.",

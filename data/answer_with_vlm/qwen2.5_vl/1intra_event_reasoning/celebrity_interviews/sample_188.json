    "model_answer": "answer: A: By moving from prep confirmations (“Are you ready?”) to a dramatic voiceover about Descendants and Disney’s most evil villains, while the visuals cut to a costumed foursome by a corrugated wall and a red apple marked “D1.”\n\nThe segment starts with a scene of people preparing for something, likely an interview, as indicated by the prep confirmation (\"Are you ready?\"). This is followed by a dramatic voiceover about Descendants and Disney's most evil villains, which signals a shift in tone and content. The visuals then cut to a group of people dressed up as characters from the movie Descendants, standing near a corrugated wall and a red apple marked \"D1,\" which further reinforces the shift to the official Descendants promotional content. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

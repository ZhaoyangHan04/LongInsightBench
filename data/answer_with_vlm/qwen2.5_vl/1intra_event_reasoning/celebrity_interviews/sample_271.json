This visual representation helps to create a connection between the speakers' words and the actual events they are discussing, making the conversation more impactful and relatable to the audience. The question at the end of the segment also suggests that the speakers are discussing whether the other person welcomes unrest in their campaign, which further emphasizes the importance of the visual imagery in reinforcing the speakers' points.",

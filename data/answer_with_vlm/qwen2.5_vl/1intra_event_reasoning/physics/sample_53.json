    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because the speaker verbally says the voltage is about 25.5 volts, but the on-screen measurement and overlay indicate the reading is actually 25.5 millivolts.\n\nThis conclusion is drawn from the fact that the video displays the text overlay clarifying the actual voltage reading as 25.5 millivolts (mV) and not 25.5 volts (V). This suggests there might have been a misunderstanding or miscommunication regarding the units of measurement, where the speaker might have mentioned the voltage in volts while the actual measurement was in millivolts.",

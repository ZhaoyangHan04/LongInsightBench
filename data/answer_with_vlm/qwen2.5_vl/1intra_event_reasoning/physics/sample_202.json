    "model_answer": "answer: B: They are equal and opposite due to the action–reaction at the contact; each arrow opposes how its block would move relative to the other (e.g., if the red tends to move up, its friction arrow is down).\n\nThe speaker explains that the friction arrows are equal and opposite because of the action-reaction principle at the contact between the blocks. Each arrow points in the direction that would oppose the motion of its respective block relative to the other block. For example, if the red block tends to move up, the friction arrow on it will be pointing down, opposing this motion.",

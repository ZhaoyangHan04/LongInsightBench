    "model_answer": "answer: Unable to answer\n\nThe provided audio segment does not contain any information about the demonstration of Newton's rings using a black circular \"paperweight\". The segment seems to be focused on a different topic, possibly related to a diagram of a lens system. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine how the Newton's rings are produced and brought into view during the specified time period.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The rings are shown first with white (warm/yellowish) light, then under various colored lights including green, blue, and red, ending in blue; the narrator notes the rings appear smaller with different colors and that in a half white/half laser image the laser-lit rings line up with the white-light rings.\n\nThis answer is supported by the information provided in the audio. The narrator explains that the rings are initially observed under white light, which is described as warm and yellowish. Then, the rings are observed under various colored lights, including green, blue, and red, and it is noted that the rings appear smaller when illuminated by these colored lights. Additionally, the narrator mentions that when the object is placed in a half white/half laser configuration, the rings from the laser-lit side align with those from the white-light side.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: The pink piece is much softer, can be deformed with only a thumb, and returns fairly quickly.\n\nIn the audio, the speaker describes the white sample as being very stiff and requiring significant force to deform, which takes nearly their entire weight. In contrast, the pink sample is described as being much softer and can be deformed with just a thumb. Additionally, the pink sample is said to recover fairly quickly compared to the white sample. Therefore, option B accurately reflects the comparison made between the two samples in terms of stiffness and recovery.",

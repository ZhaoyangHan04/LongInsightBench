    "model_answer": "answer: Unable to answer\n\nThe provided audio segment does not contain any explicit statements about the importance of both peak acceleration and its duration in assessing head injury risk. There is no mention of the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) formula or any plots related to torque. Therefore, it's impossible to determine from this segment whether the segment demonstrates the importance of both peak acceleration and its duration in assessing head injury risk.",

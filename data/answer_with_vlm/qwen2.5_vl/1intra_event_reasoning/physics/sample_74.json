The field lines start at the North pole and end at the South pole, forming closed loops. When a closed surface encloses a magnetic dipole, the number of field lines entering the surface is equal to the number of field lines leaving the surface, resulting in a net flux of zero. This is consistent with the Biot-Savart law and the concept of magnetic flux conservation.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The yellow field lines are shown looping so that entries and exits through the gray circle balance, while the speaker explicitly states the net flux is still zero in this case.\n\nIn the video, the speaker explains that the net magnetic flux through the gray closed surface remains zero because the yellow field lines loop around the surface such that they enter and exit equally. This means there's no net flux passing through the surface. The speaker also explicitly mentions this point during the relevant segment of the video. Therefore, option A correctly describes the justification for the net magnetic flux remaining zero.",

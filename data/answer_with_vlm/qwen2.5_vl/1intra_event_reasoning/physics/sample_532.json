    "model_answer": "answer: A: He sets the normal reaction to zero so that mg cosθ equals qB·u, and uses the work–energy theorem noting that only gravity does work along the sliding distance because magnetic force and the normal are perpendicular to the displacement.\n\nThe presenter explains that the normal reaction is set to zero, which implies that the magnetic force and the normal force are perpendicular to the direction of motion, thus they do no work. The gravitational force acts along the incline, doing work, while the magnetic force is perpendicular to the motion and does not contribute to the energy change. This allows the presenter to use the work-energy theorem to determine the speed at which the particle loses contact with the incline.",

Therefore, there is insufficient context to determine which option correctly describes the process.",

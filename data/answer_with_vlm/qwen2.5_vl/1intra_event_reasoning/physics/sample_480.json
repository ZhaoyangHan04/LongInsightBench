    "model_answer": "answer: Unable to answer\n\nThe provided audio segment does not contain any information regarding the computation of energy, the sign of the energy, or the specific heat of aluminum. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the reason behind the negative energy value or its implications based on the given information.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because the specific heat displayed is in J/(mol·K), so the amount must be in moles and the temperature change must be in Kelvin to match the units.\n\nThe presenter converts grams to moles because the specific heat capacity of tungsten is given in joules per mole per kelvin (J/(mol·K)). This means that the amount of substance needs to be expressed in moles to correctly use the specific heat value. Additionally, the temperature change is converted from Celsius to Kelvin because the specific heat formula uses Kelvin as its temperature unit. Therefore, both the amount and the temperature need to be in compatible units to perform the calculation accurately.",

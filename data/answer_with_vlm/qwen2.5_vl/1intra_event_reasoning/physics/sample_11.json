    "model_answer": "answer: A: To derive velocity and acceleration from the displacement so vibrations can be analyzed completely.\n\nThe instructor writes and points to derivatives like d^2x/dt^2 alongside expressions such as A cos(ωt) on the whiteboard to derive velocity and acceleration from the displacement. This is because vibrations involve the analysis of motion over time, which requires knowing the velocity and acceleration in addition to the displacement. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.",

This suggests that he is discussing the general vectorial or complex representation of SHM, where either sine or cosine can be used to express the displacement. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",

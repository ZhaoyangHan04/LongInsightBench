    "model_answer": "answer: A: To illustrate that electromagnetism underlies electricity, magnetism, light, and chemistry at the atomic level, connecting the light bulb and magnetic needle to the atoms.\n\nThe scene transition from a solar-system visualization to a compass and light bulb under the \"Electromagnetism\" title suggests a focus on the fundamental forces of nature. The compass needle pointing towards a cluster of atoms implies a connection between electromagnetism and atomic-level phenomena. This transition is likely intended to demonstrate how electromagnetism plays a role in various aspects of physics, including electricity, magnetism, light, and chemistry, which are all interconnected at the atomic level. Therefore, option A best explains this sequence of events.",

    "model_answer": "answer: C: It serves as a bridge to the overlay that lists quarks, leptons, and force carriers (Z, W, g), tying the exchange analogy to specific particles that mediate forces.\n\nThe animation in the video depicts two figures exchanging a thrown object, which visually represents the concept of forces arising from the exchange of particles. This aligns with the on-screen overlay that lists quarks, leptons, and force carriers such as Z, W, and g. The animation is designed to connect the idea of exchanging objects with the scientific concept of force mediators, making option C the most appropriate choice.",

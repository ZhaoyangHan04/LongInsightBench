    "model_answer": "The video segment does not provide explicit details about the axes and force components for the inclined-plane diagram. The presenter explains that the x-axis is chosen parallel to the plane with a positive direction up the incline, and the weight mg is resolved into components along both the x and y axes. However, there is no mention of the normal force N contributing to the x-direction net force or the applied/bumper force F being perpendicular to the plane. Therefore, the correct answer cannot be determined from the given information.\n\nAnswer: Unable to answer",

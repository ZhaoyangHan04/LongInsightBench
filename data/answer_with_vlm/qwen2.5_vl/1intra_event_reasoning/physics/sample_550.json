The narration and visuals in the segment do not clearly illustrate the relationship between potential energy, attractive particles, and mass as described by E=mc^2. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nanswer: Unable to answer",

    "model_answer": "The video segment discusses nuclear reactions and the concept of mass-energy equivalence. It mentions that when a nucleus is split into its constituent nucleons, there is a loss of mass, which is converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation E=mcÂ². This loss of mass is what causes the nuclear scale to tip in favor of the bound nucleus over the separated nucleons. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: A: The separated nucleons have a greater total mass than the bound nucleus.",

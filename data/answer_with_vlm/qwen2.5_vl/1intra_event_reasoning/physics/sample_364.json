The audio seems to be discussing the relationship between energy and mass as represented by the equation E=mcÂ² and a humorous statement about instant beans. Therefore, there is insufficient information to answer the question accurately.",

    "model_answer": "answer: Unable to answer\n\nThe provided audio segment does not contain any information about an isolated neutron's behavior or decay process over time. The visuals and narration in the given audio clips pertain to the concept of energy and mass equivalence and a humorous statement about instant beans, but they do not address the decay of a neutron. Therefore, there is insufficient information to draw a conclusion about the state of an isolated neutron after 15 minutes.",

This visual evidence directly supports the claim made by the speaker about the solenoid producing a strong, uniform magnetic field in the center. The other options do not align with the speaker's description or the visual evidence presented in the audio.",

    "model_answer": "The speaker implies that the number of turns (N), current (I), and length (L) of the solenoid can be adjusted to control the magnetic field inside it. This is supported by the equation B_inside = (μ₀ N I)/L shown on the slide. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: Adjust N (number of turns), I (current), and L (length), as indicated by B_inside = (μ₀ N I)/L on the slide.",

    "model_answer": "The video shows a series of zoom-ins on elements like T, He, and then Li and Na, followed by side-by-side electron configuration diagrams of Li and Na. The zoom-ins and diagrams visually represent the periodicity of the table by showing how the outer electron configurations repeat across periods. This supports the narrator's explanation that properties recur periodically due to the repeating patterns of outer-electron arrangements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: They visualize a repeating pattern of outer-electron arrangements across periods, matching the narratorâ€™s claim that properties recur periodically.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A: Because those wavelengths reflect strongly off vegetation that the lidar is scanning.\n\nThe speaker explains that the airplane's lidar scans the ground using specific wavelengths of light, which are highlighted in the video as green (532 nm) and near-infrared (1064 nm). The reason for highlighting these wavelengths is that they reflect strongly off vegetation, allowing the lidar system to detect and measure the ground features accurately. This is consistent with the on-screen spectrum showing these wavelengths being used by the lidar system. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

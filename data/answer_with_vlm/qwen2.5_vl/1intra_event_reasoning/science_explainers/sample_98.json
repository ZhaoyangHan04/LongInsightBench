    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: The scene shifts to a misty, ominous landscape and a car drives away as the audio transitions to instrumental music, heightening suspense.\n\nExplanation: Between 00:02:39.916 and 00:03:04.880, the video transitions from a rural scene to a misty, ominous landscape where a car drives away. This shift in scenery and the addition of instrumental music create a sense of suspense and anticipation. The narrator does not provide any specific instructions or ask viewers to take any particular action during this segment. Therefore, option B accurately describes the actions taken by the narrator and the elements used to build anticipation for an upcoming reveal.",

    "model_answer": "answer: B: To suggest the eclipse’s path aligning near towns named Nineveh may be a meaningful \"sign of Jonah,\" not mere coincidence.\n\nThe speaker displays a U.S. map marking seven towns named \"Nineveh\" near the eclipse path and then shows Matthew 12:39–41 about the \"sign of the prophet Jonah\" to suggest that the alignment of the eclipse path with these towns may have a deeper meaning, rather than being a mere coincidence. This is likely to imply that the eclipse could be seen as a significant event, possibly related to the biblical prophecy of the sign of Jonah.",

    "model_answer": "answer: Unable to answer\n\nThe provided audio segment does not contain sufficient information about the device's operation or the specific mechanism that sustains its motion. The segment appears to be focused on the presenter explaining the concept of Nitinol and its properties rather than demonstrating the device in action. Therefore, it is impossible to determine how the device begins running or what sustains its motion based solely on this segment.",

    "model_answer": "answer: B: Copper plastically deforms when bent too far, whereas Nitinol exhibits superelasticity and snaps back to its original shape even after severe bending.\n\nThe speaker discusses the deformation behavior of copper wire and Nitinol wire in the context of the experiment. He mentions that copper wire will plastically deform if bent too far, meaning it won't return to its original shape without being reset. In contrast, Nitinol wire demonstrates superelasticity, which means it can be bent severely and will snap back to its original shape upon release. This behavior is characteristic of superelastic materials like Nitinol, which is used in the experiment. Therefore, option B correctly describes the observed deformation behavior of both materials.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because Earth rotates from west to east, making the sun seem to travel east-to-west across the sky, as illustrated by the day/night divide and explained by the narrator.\n\nIn the video, the narrator explains that the sun appears to move from east to west during the sunrise-to-sunset sequence because the Earth rotates on its axis from west to east. This rotation creates the illusion of the sun's movement across the sky. The other options are incorrect because they either describe the sun's actual orbit around the Earth (Option B) or the Earth's revolution around the sun (Option C), which are not the reasons for the apparent east-to-west motion of the sun. Option D is also incorrect because there is no indication in the video that the camera is moving; it is a stationary shot showing the Earth's rotation.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A: The pendulum’s swing plane remains fixed while the floor (Earth) rotates beneath it, so over time it knocks down pegs—as seen in the “30 seconds later”/“90 seconds later” visuals and explained by the narrator.\n\nThe demonstration with the Foucault pendulum shows that Earth is rotating because the pendulum's swing plane remains fixed while the Earth rotates beneath it. Over time, this causes the pendulum to appear to change its direction, which is demonstrated in the video through the \"30 seconds later\" and \"90 seconds later\" visuals. This effect is explained by the narrator as well. Option B is incorrect because star trails circling Polaris are not directly causing the pendulum to change direction; rather, it is the rotation of the Earth that is causing the apparent change in the pendulum's direction. Option C is incorrect because the pendulum does not speed up due to Earth's revolution around the sun; instead, it demonstrates the rotation of the Earth. Option D is incorrect because the pendulum's cord is not repositioned between shots to fake a changing direction; it is the rotation of the Earth that causes the pendulum to appear to change its direction.",

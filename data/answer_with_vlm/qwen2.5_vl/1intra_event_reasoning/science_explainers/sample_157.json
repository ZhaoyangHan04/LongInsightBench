    "model_answer": "The answer is B: By striking the bag repeatedly with consistent timing as its arc increases, demonstrating resonance.\n\nIn the audio, the presenter describes striking the punching bag in a way that causes the bag's swing to grow larger over time. This is indicative of resonance, where the repeated strikes at the bag's natural frequency cause the amplitude of the swing to increase. The other options don't align with the description provided in the audio. Option A suggests a single, hard hit, which would not cause the swing to grow larger. Option C implies random taps to prevent motion, which contradicts the observed behavior. Option D suggests letting the bag swing freely without any additional strikes, which also doesn't match the described action. Therefore, option B is the correct choice.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A: To realize the thought experiment of gluing opposite edges of a square—“blowing the other two sides together”—thereby forming a double-loopy, video-game torus.\n\nThe green board in the video is shown to twist into a doughnut-like shape, which is a visual representation of a mathematical concept known as a torus. This concept is often used in theoretical physics and mathematics to describe the shape formed when a square is bent and its opposite edges are glued together. The video demonstrates this idea by showing the green board transforming from a flat surface into a torus shape, which is a key aspect of the thought experiment mentioned in option A.",

Therefore, I cannot determine which construction is being illustrated or what on-screen motion reinforces the key property the narrator emphasizes.",

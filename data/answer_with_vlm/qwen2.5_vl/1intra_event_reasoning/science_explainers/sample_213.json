The yellow/red clash markers in the inset image visually represent these clashes, indicating that certain φ values cannot be achieved without causing atomic collisions. Therefore, option A correctly describes this phenomenon.",

Additionally, the plot visually demonstrates clashes across the ψ sweep for φ = 0°. This evidence directly contradicts the possibility of φ = 0° occurring without clashes, thus supporting the conclusion that φ = 0° is physically impossible.",

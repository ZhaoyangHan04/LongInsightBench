    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: By using ultrasonic sound waves to atomize water and a small fan to propel the mist; a demineralization cartridge helps prevent white dust.\n\nIn the video, the narrator mentions that the humidifier uses ultrasonic sound waves to atomize water into a fine mist. This aligns with option B. Additionally, the video shows a demineralization cartridge, which is indicated as helping to prevent white dust, further supporting option B. The other options are incorrect because they either involve heat (boiling water) or different mechanisms for generating mist (chemical addition, air compression).",

    "model_answer": "answer: A: To humorously bridge the everyday idea of “feeling big” after eating with the far greater scale of cosmic objects, setting up the question of what the biggest things are.\n\nThe video juxtaposes the mundane act of eating chips in a kitchen with the act of eating a sandwich while driving, both of which are associated with the feeling of being full and potentially feeling \"big.\" This is then contrasted with the narrator's observation about the Milky Way and the question about the biggest objects in the universe, which is a much larger scale of existence. The juxtaposition serves to humorously highlight the difference between the everyday experience of eating and the vastness of the universe, setting up the question of what the biggest things are. Option B is incorrect because there is no mention of the dangers of eating while driving at night under starry skies. Option C is incorrect because there is no indication of cooking techniques or astrophotography tips. Option D is incorrect because the video does not suggest that outdoor stargazing makes you feel small no matter how much you eat.",

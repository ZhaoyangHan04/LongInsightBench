    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because the baby encounters far more antigens from their diaper than from the shot, as indicated by the on-screen annotation of approximately 80,000 antigens in the baby versus about 10 in the syringe.\n\nIn the audio, the narrator explains that babies encounter many more antigens through their diapers than they do from the shots they receive. The on-screen annotation supports this claim by showing that a baby encounters approximately 80,000 antigens daily, while the syringe contains only about 10 antigens. This comparison demonstrates that the baby's immune system is not overwhelmed by the small number of antigens in the vaccine.",

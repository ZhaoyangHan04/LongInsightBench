    "model_answer": "The segment between 00:02:20.190 and 00:04:09.241 discusses Lysenko's \"Jarovization\" method, which involves treating winter wheat as if it were spring wheat to increase its yield. The segment shows why Jarovization appeared useful by visually comparing winter vs. spring wheat and displaying two labeled pots (control vs. Jarovized winter wheat), while the narration explains how Jarovization makes winter wheat behave like spring wheat. This is option A.\n\nAdditionally, the segment concludes that Jarovization wasn't a novel discovery by explicitly connecting it to the pre-existing concept of vernalization in the narration and visually presenting Gustav Gassner and a vernalization graph. This is option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are:\n\nA: By visually comparing winter vs. spring wheat and showing two labeled pots (control vs. Jarovized winter wheat) while the narration explains Jarovization makes winter wheat behave like spring wheat.\nB: By explicitly connecting Jarovization to the pre-existing concept of vernalization in the narration and visually presenting Gustav Gassner and a vernalization graph.",

It also mentions that Lysenko's influence declined after Stalin's death.

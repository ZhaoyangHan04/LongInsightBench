    "model_answer": "answer: B\n\nThe video cuts from glowing charcoal to an electric stove and then shows a person lifting the lid of a pot to illustrate a more reliable, controllable heat source (stove vs coals). The lid is lifted to show its role in retaining vapors, which is analogous to preventing solvent from boiling away during a chemical process. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: The speaker explicitly says the boiling and condensing can continue as long as the hot plate is hot and the condenser is working, and the tall, tower-like drawing with horizontal lines depicts the vapor path up and condensate returning down.\n\nIn the audio, the speaker explains that the refluxing process can continue as long as the hot plate remains hot and the condenser is functioning properly. This aligns with option B. Additionally, the whiteboard drawing shows a tall structure with horizontal lines, which represents the vapor rising up and condensate returning down, further supporting this explanation. Option A is incorrect because it mentions red arrows pointing toward and away from the tall structure, which is not mentioned in the audio. Option C is incorrect because the red arrows do not indicate increasing stirring speed; they are used to show heat flow. Option D is incorrect because the horizontal lines across the tower represent the vapor path and condensate return, not separate steps that prevent a cyclical process.",

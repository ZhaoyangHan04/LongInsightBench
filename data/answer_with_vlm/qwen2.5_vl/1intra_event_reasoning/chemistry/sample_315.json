    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because the problem asks how much energy is released, so the magnitude (3220 kJ) is reported, while the negative sign in the equation and narration indicates release.\n\nIn the context of chemical reactions, the sign of ΔH (change in enthalpy) indicates whether the reaction is exothermic (ΔH < 0) or endothermic (ΔH > 0). In this case, the negative sign in the equation and narration suggests that the reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases energy. The magnitude of the energy change is reported as 3220 kJ because the problem specifically asks for the amount of energy released, rather than the direction of the energy flow. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the magnitude (3220 kJ) is reported, while the negative sign in the equation and narration indicates release.",

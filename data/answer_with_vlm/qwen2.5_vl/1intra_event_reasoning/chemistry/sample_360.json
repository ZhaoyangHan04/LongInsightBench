    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because the plotted curve goes downhill from reactants to products and he explains that downhill indicates an exothermic reaction.\n\nIn the provided diagrams, the reaction coordinate (x-axis) represents the progress of the reaction, while the potential energy (y-axis) represents the energy changes associated with the reaction. The presenter explains that the reaction is exothermic because the curve goes downhill from the reactants to the products, indicating that the products have less potential energy than the reactants. This decrease in potential energy corresponds to the release of energy as heat, which is characteristic of an exothermic reaction. Therefore, option A correctly describes the reasoning behind the presenter's conclusion.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: The case with ΔH = −30 kJ corresponds to 30 kJ being released (exothermic), consistent with the speaker’s analogy of taking money out of a checkbook.\n\nThe speaker discusses ΔH values and their relation to energy changes during reactions. He mentions that a negative ΔH value indicates energy is released, which aligns with the exothermic nature of the process. The diagram shows a decrease in potential energy, which is consistent with an exothermic reaction where energy is released to the surroundings. Therefore, option B is supported by both the speaker's statement and the annotated diagram.",

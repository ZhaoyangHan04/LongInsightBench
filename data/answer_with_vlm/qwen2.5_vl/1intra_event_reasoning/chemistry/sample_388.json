    "model_answer": "answer: A: To connect a human-built fusion experiment (ITER) with the natural fusion occurring in stars like the Sun, as the narrator discusses fusion in space.\n\nThe video cuts from the ITER construction site to close-up images of the Sun to illustrate the connection between human efforts in fusion technology and the natural process that occurs in stars. This transition likely serves to highlight the potential of ITER as a step towards harnessing nuclear fusion for energy production, which is a topic the narrator may be discussing in the lecture. Option B is incorrect because there's no indication that ITER is already operating or monitoring the Sun. Option C is incorrect because the video doesn't suggest any connection between the ITER construction site and solar power. Option D is incorrect because the transition is not random; it's meant to convey a specific scientific concept.",

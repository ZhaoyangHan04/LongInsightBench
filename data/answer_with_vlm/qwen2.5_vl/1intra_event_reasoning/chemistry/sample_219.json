The narration and visuals only describe the action of pouring the cloudy, foamy liquid into a paper-lined beaker and then forcing the white mass through a strainer. There is no mention of gravitational filtration, grinding, vacuum filtration, or gloves being used. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine the correct reason for using the strainer in this context.",

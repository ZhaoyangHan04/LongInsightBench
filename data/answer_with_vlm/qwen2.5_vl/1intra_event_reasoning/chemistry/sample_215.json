    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because the slide labels ΔH as positive (Endo) and notes decomposition only around 1100 K at 1 atm, while the speaker explains it requires significant energy and only occurs at extremely high temperatures—so at STP there isn't enough energy to drive it.\n\nIn the audio, the instructor discusses the decomposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) into calcium oxide (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO₂). The key points made in the narration and the slide are:\n\n- The reaction is endothermic (ΔH is positive), meaning it absorbs heat.\n- The decomposition process occurs only at very high temperatures (around 1100 K).\n- At standard temperature and pressure (STP), the reaction does not occur spontaneously due to the lack of sufficient energy to overcome the activation barrier.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the reaction is endothermic, not exothermic, and it does not happen spontaneously at room temperature. Option C is incorrect because the formation of a gas alone does not make a reaction non-spontaneous; it depends on the energy changes involved. Option D is incorrect because the pressure at STP does not prevent CO₂ from forming; rather, it's the high activation energy required",

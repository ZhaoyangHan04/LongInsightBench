    "model_answer": "The speaker discusses a mechanism enabling excitation with longer wavelengths, which is described as two-photon absorption via a virtual state. This mechanism is depicted on the slide by two lower-energy arrows passing through a labeled \"virtual state\" between the ground and excited states, with a green arrow indicating fluorescence. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: Two-photon absorption via a virtual state, depicted by two lower-energy arrows passing through a labeled “virtual state” between ground and excited states, with a green arrow indicating fluorescence.",

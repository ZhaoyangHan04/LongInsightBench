    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The ratio is 1 N2 : 3 H2 : 2 NH3, and balancing is necessary to satisfy conservation of matter and mass and to enable correct stoichiometric calculations, as shown and stated.\n\nExplanation: The audio discusses the Haber-Bosch process, which is used to produce ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2). The specific stoichiometric ratio mentioned in the audio is 1 N2 : 3 H2 : 2 NH3. Balancing the equation is essential to ensure that the law of conservation of mass is satisfied, meaning that the total number of atoms of each element must be equal on both sides of the chemical equation. This balance is crucial for accurate stoichiometric calculations, which help determine the amounts of reactants needed and the amounts of products formed in a chemical reaction. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.",

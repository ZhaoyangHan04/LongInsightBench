    "model_answer": "answer: C: By displaying ChemCon branding over a world map and identifying the second speakerâ€™s location as Helsinki, while the narration focuses only on REACH symbols and does not introduce any person or COVID-19 context.\n\nThe video starts by showing a world map with ChemCon branding, which suggests a global discussion. The second speaker's location is identified as Helsinki, Finland, indicating the international nature of the discussion. The narration focuses on REACH symbols, which are related to chemical safety regulations, but there is no mention of COVID-19 or any other specific context. Therefore, option C best describes how the video establishes the remote, globally framed discussion on EU PFAS and microplastics despite COVID-19.",

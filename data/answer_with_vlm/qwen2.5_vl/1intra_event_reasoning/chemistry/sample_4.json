The question asks for evidence within the segment itself, but there is no mention of carbon dioxide being produced or any related observations. Therefore, it's impossible to determine if the correct option applies based solely on the given information.",

The segment focuses on introducing ion exchange reactions and does not discuss the specific reaction mentioned in the question. Therefore, it's impossible to determine if the reaction is exothermic or if table salt is produced as a solid based on this segment alone.",

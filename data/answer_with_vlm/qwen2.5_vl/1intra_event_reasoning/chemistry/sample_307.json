The speaker also mentions that a knob is adjusted to scan many wavelengths, and the detector records the intensities at each wavelength to build the absorption spectrum. This matches option A.",

The segment seems to be discussing the concept of a monochromator and its role in spectroscopy, but there's no mention of a second design or its practical application. Therefore, I cannot provide a confident answer based on the given information.",

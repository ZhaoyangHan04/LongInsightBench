    "model_answer": "answer: A: To argue that Celsius is unsuitable because it allows negative temperatures while kinetic energy is always positive, motivating a temperature scale that is always positive.\n\nThe segment shows a prohibition sign over a thermometer, which suggests that the Celsius scale might not be suitable due to its ability to display negative temperatures. The comparison of simulations at 1°C and −1°C is likely done to illustrate how the kinetic energy-temperature relationship works in both positive and negative temperature ranges. Since kinetic energy is always positive, the Celsius scale's ability to display negative temperatures could be seen as problematic. This leads to the motivation for a temperature scale that is always positive, such as the Kelvin scale.",

The frames show a character running and jumping, but there's no mention of the chemical formula or its derivation. Therefore, it's impossible to determine which option correctly describes the justification presented in the audio during this time period.",

The audio seems to be related to a superhero character running and jumping, which is unrelated to the chemical formula mentioned in the question. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine the reason for using brackets around OH in the formula.",

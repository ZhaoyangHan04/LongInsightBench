The visual content shows a path through a forested area, but there's no indication of water features or bridges. Therefore, it's impossible to determine if the path runs near a stream or river based on the given information.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A, B\n\nThe speaker explicitly mentions drought, imagines a low reservoir, and says the usually flowing stream is \"absolutely dead.\" This directly supports the conclusion that the stream has dried up due to drought conditions. Additionally, the visuals show a dry, rocky, uneven path with no visible running water or wet ground, which further supports the conclusion that the stream has dried up. Option C is not relevant as wind is not mentioned in the audio. Option D contradicts the conclusion as it suggests that the forest is lush and green, which would be unlikely if the stream had dried up due to drought conditions.",

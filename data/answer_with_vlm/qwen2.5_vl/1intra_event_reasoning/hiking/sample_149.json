    "model_answer": "Answer: A: The speaker says, “we’re finally walking along the ridge,” while the visuals cut to expansive mountain views and a snow trail following the crest, with wind picking up.\n\nThe speaker explicitly states that they are walking along the ridge, and the visuals confirm this by showing expansive mountain views and a snow trail following the crest. Additionally, the wind picking up suggests they are at a higher elevation, which is consistent with being on a ridge. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: The narrator mentions being at the top while the visuals show a man on a snowy peak raising a Canadian flag that flutters in the wind.\n\nThe narrator explicitly states, \"We're at the top,\" which confirms their arrival at the summit. Additionally, the visual of a man on a snowy peak holding a Canadian flag further supports this conclusion as it aligns with the typical imagery associated with reaching the summit of a mountain. The flag's fluttering in the wind also suggests that they are at a high elevation where wind conditions are likely to be stronger. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

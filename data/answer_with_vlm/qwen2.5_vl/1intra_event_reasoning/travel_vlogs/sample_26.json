    "model_answer": "answer: A: Because she states in the audio that the video will discuss airport security and her experiences as someone with a visible disability, while the visuals (title card and airplane wing) simply set a general travel context.\n\nThe speaker mentions in the audio that the video will be about airport security and her experiences as someone with a visible disability, which is not reflected by the initial on-screen text \"How to get free flights.\" The visuals of the title card and airplane wing suggest a general travel context, but the speaker's statement about the video's focus on airport security and her personal experiences contradicts this. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

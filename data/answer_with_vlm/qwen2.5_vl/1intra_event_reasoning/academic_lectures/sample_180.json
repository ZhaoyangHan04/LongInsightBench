    "model_answer": "The speaker states that only a little bit but not a lot can be known about Proto-World due to the immense timescales involved, such as humans in Africa around 100,000 years before present and a 7-million-year split from chimpanzees. This reasoning is anchored visually by the 100,000 YBP timeline, the human–chimp–bonobo divergence diagram, and maps with question marks. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: Because the timescales involved are immense—humans in Africa around 100,000 years before present and a 7-million-year split from chimpanzees—so reconstruction is limited; this is anchored visually by the 100,000 YBP timeline, the human–chimp–bonobo divergence diagram, and maps with question marks.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: To show that Williamâ€™s defeat of King Harold at the Battle of Hastings initiated the Anglo-Norman period and a mixing of Norman and Anglo-Saxon languages into Anglo-Norman.\n\nThe presenter sequences these visuals to illustrate the historical context of the Anglo-Norman period, which began after William the Conqueror's victory over King Harold at the Battle of Hastings. This event led to the Norman conquest of England, resulting in the introduction of Norman French and Norman culture, which mixed with the existing Anglo-Saxon culture to form the new Anglo-Norman language. The language formula shown later in the video likely represents the transition from Old English to Anglo-Norman, highlighting the linguistic changes during this period. Therefore, option A best explains the presenter's choice of visuals and their sequence.",

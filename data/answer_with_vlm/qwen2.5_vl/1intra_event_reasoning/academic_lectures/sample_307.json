    "model_answer": "answer: A: To illustrate how large-scale order can arise without centralized control, exemplifying self-organization and the emergence of global patterns.\n\nThe video pairs visuals of flocks of birds and connected hexagonal patterns with the on-screen emphasis of \"Self-Organization\" and the concluding word \"Emergence.\" This pairing is likely used to demonstrate how large-scale order can emerge from simple local interactions, without the need for a central controller. The visual of birds flying in a flock represents the concept of self-organization, where individual birds follow simple rules, leading to a coordinated movement as a whole. Similarly, the connected hexagonal patterns represent the emergence of global patterns from local interactions between the hexagons. Therefore, option A best explains the purpose of these visuals and the on-screen emphasis in the video.",

    "model_answer": "The video segment between 00:03:56.102 and 00:04:21.302 uses visual metaphors to illustrate the concept of complexity theory. It shows a balance labeled \"Equilibrium\" versus \"NonEquilibrium,\" people in motion with circular arrows, and a person labeled \"Linear Thinking\" hammering a box labeled \"Complex System.\" This sequence suggests that the video is highlighting the limitations of linear thinking when dealing with complex systems.\n\nThe visual metaphor of a person using a hammer to address a complex system implies that linear, forceful methods are inadequate for managing complex systems. The circular arrows around the people suggest ongoing, dynamic processes rather than static equilibrium, which further supports the idea that complex systems are not easily controlled by simple, linear methods.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: That far-from-equilibrium change is governed by feedback loops, so applying linear, hammer-like methods to complex systems is inappropriate.",

The segment seems to be focused on explaining genetics concepts related to DNA and alleles. Therefore, there is insufficient information in the given audio to determine the reason for the brief pause and the drinking sound.",

The speaker does not explicitly state that a dominant allele shows its trait whenever present, nor does he use the term \"ALLELE\" in a way that indicates dominance. While the whiteboard diagram may show allele pairs labeled DARK and LIGHT to illustrate dominance versus recessiveness, this is not mentioned in the provided audio segment. The speaker does use the example of dark hair as a dominant trait, but this is not presented as evidence of how dominant alleles manifest over recessive ones. Therefore, there is insufficient information in the provided audio segment to answer the question.",

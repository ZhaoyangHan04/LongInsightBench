    "model_answer": "answer: A: It is the true bearing between two beacons, read on the protractor by starting from the zero mark and adding the degrees past 90 as measured on the map.\n\nThe instructor mentions \"94 to be accurate,\" which suggests that he is referring to a specific angle measurement. Given the context of using a protractor on a map and the mention of landmarks such as the Golf Course and Landing Strip, it is reasonable to conclude that the instructor is measuring a true bearing between these two points. The true bearing is typically measured by starting from the zero mark on the protractor and adding the degrees past 90, as mentioned in option A. Therefore, option A is the most likely correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because it’s a magnetic bearing, which is recorded without a direction letter; it was obtained by adding the true bearing (94°) to the magnetic declination (23° 01').\n\nIn the given segment, the speaker explains that the magnetic bearing is calculated by adding the true bearing to the magnetic declination. The calculation provided is 94° + 23° 01' = 117° 01'. Since magnetic bearings are typically recorded without a direction letter, the direction letter 'N' or 'S' is omitted in this case. Therefore, option A correctly describes the reason for omitting the direction letter and how the input values were used to produce the result.",

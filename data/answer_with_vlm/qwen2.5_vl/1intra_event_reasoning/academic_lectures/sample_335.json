However, based on the visual cues provided in the images, we can infer some details:\n\n- The character is visually coated in dripping, toxic-looking purple liquid, which might initially lead viewers to believe it's a Logia.\n- The on-screen \"DOKU DOKU\" text labels the fruit as Logia until corrected later.\n\nTherefore, the most likely reason for initial misclassification and the segment that corrects that misconception would be:\n\nAnswer: A: The character is visually coated in dripping, toxic-looking purple liquid, making it seem like he's become poison itself.\nAnswer: C: The on-screen \"DOKU DOKU\" text labels the fruit as Logia until corrected later.\n\nThe other options don't provide sufficient information from the images to determine if they are correct.",

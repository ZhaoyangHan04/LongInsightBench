    "model_answer": "Answer: A: Because the membrane selectively permits cargo in and out, which the speaker likens to control officers, and the slide bullets explicitly note a “selective barrier” and “transport of nutrients and waste.”\n\nThe presenter compares the plasma membrane to airport passport control because it acts as a selective barrier, allowing certain substances to pass through while blocking others. This is supported by the slide bullets that mention a \"selective barrier\" and the transport of nutrients and waste. The slide also shows a diagram of the membrane with different types of molecules passing through it, further emphasizing the selective nature of the membrane.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A\n\nThe speaker mentions glycosylation and then asks to look at a phospholipid molecule \"in a little bit in detail,\" indicating a transition to a more detailed diagram. This is supported by the narration, which states that the slide switches to a diagram showing the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tails with labeled phosphate, glycerol, and fatty acids. Therefore, option A is correct.",

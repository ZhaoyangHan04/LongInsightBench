    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because hydrogen is less dense than air and diffuses into the porous pot faster than air diffuses out, creating excess pressure that pushes the U-tube liquid down in the closed end and up in the open end.\n\nExplanation: The video describes the process of diffusion where hydrogen gas is supplied to a porous pot connected to a U-shaped glass tube containing blue liquid. As hydrogen diffuses into the porous pot, it creates an increase in pressure inside the pot. This increased pressure causes the liquid in the closed end of the U-tube to be pushed downward, while the liquid in the open end rises due to the pressure difference. This phenomenon is known as the diffusion of gases and is a result of the difference in density between hydrogen and air. The other options are incorrect because they either involve mechanical pumping (Option B) or incorrect assumptions about the behavior of hydrogen (Options C and D).",

The video shows a beaker on a metal stand, but it does not mention any specific factors affecting diffusion speed. Therefore, the correct answer cannot be determined from the provided information.\n\nAnswer: Unable to answer",

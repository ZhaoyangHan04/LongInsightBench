    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Light-activated rhodopsin stimulates phosphodiesterase, which converts cGMP to GMP, lowering cGMP so the cyclic nucleotideâ€“gated Na+ channels are no longer held open.\n\nIn the provided audio, it explains that when light hits the photoreceptors, it activates rhodopsin. This activation leads to the stimulation of phosphodiesterase, which then converts cGMP into GMP. The decrease in cGMP concentration causes the cyclic nucleotide-gated sodium channels to close, thus reducing sodium entry into the photoreceptor cells. This process is part of the visual transduction mechanism and is depicted in the labeled diagram as well.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Axons from the medial portions of the retinas cross at the optic chiasm to the contralateral side, which is shown by fibers crossing at the chiasm in the pathway diagram.\n\nThis answer is supported by the information provided in the audio and the figure. The audio mentions that the axons from the medial portions of the retinas cross at the optic chiasm to the contralateral side, ensuring that each hemisphere processes the opposite visual field. The figure also shows the crossing of fibers at the chiasm, which visually supports this description.",

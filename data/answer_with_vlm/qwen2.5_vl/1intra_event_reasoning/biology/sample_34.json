    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because blood vessels lack dual innervation and are innervated only by sympathetic efferents, so nicotine's global stimulation cannot be canceled there, leading to vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure.\n\nNicotine primarily stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, which causes vasoconstriction in blood vessels. Blood vessels do not have dual innervation; they are predominantly innervated by sympathetic fibers. Therefore, when nicotine stimulates these fibers, it leads to vasoconstriction, which increases blood pressure. The other options are incorrect because nicotine does not selectively stimulate parasympathetic fibers (option B), it does not block parasympathetic receptors (option C), and the rise in blood pressure is not mainly due to smoking behavior itself but rather due to the sympathetic stimulation of blood vessels (option D).",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: By acting as an adrenergic receptor agonist in the iris smooth muscle to produce pupillary dilation, enabling an ophthalmologist to view the eyeâ€™s internal anatomy.\n\nIn the audio, the speaker explains that phenylephrine is used in ophthalmic exams to dilate the pupil. This dilation allows the ophthalmologist to better visualize the eye's internal structures. The mechanism of action described in option A aligns with this explanation, as phenylephrine acts as an adrenergic receptor agonist, specifically on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the iris, leading to pupil dilation. The other options either describe the opposite effect (constriction) or incorrect mechanisms (binding adrenergic receptors without dilation).",

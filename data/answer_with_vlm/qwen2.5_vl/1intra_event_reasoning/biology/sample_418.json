The video segment is focused on the right side internal features of the heart anatomy, but there is no mention of the pulmonary trunk, superior vena cava, or aorta in this context. Therefore, it's impossible to determine which steps and conclusions the instructor uses to verify the major vessel leading away from the right ventricle based on the given information.",

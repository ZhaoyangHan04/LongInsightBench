    "model_answer": "answer: A: To emphasize that many obesity-associated variants are expressed in the brain and relate to appetite regulation, even though each common allele has only a small effect on risk.\n\nThe speaker mentions that most common alleles only slightly impact obesity risk, which suggests that the focus is on the cumulative effect of these alleles rather than their individual impact. The large brain image likely serves as a visual cue to highlight the role of the brain in obesity, specifically in relation to appetite regulation. This aligns with option A, which emphasizes the importance of brain-related variants in obesity despite their small individual effects. Option B is incorrect because it contradicts the speaker's statement about the small impact of common alleles. Option C is irrelevant since the slide content is not related to physical activity. Option D is not supported by the information provided in the audio.",

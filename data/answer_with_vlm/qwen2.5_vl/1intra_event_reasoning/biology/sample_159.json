    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because only the anthers are inoculated into a medium (with components like glutamine, L-serine, and inositol) to induce androgenesis, while filaments are unnecessary for culture.\n\nIn the context of anther culture, the focus is on inducing androgenesis, which is the process of producing male gametes directly from somatic cells. The anthers contain the pollen grains that will eventually develop into male gametes. The filament, on the other hand, is the stalk-like structure that supports the anther but does not contribute to the development of male gametes. Therefore, discarding the filament ensures that only the anthers are inoculated into the culture medium, allowing for the induction of androgenesis without the presence of the filament.",

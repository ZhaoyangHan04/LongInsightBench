    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because the 2' OH of a specific adenine within the intron attacks the 5' splice site to create a branch (lariat), after which the 3' OH of the 5' exon attacks the 3' splice site to ligate the exons.\n\nThis process describes Group II intron splicing, where the intron forms a lariat structure by the 2' OH of a specific adenine attacking the 5' splice site. The 3' OH of the 5' exon then attacks the 3' splice site, resulting in the ligation of the exons. This mechanism is distinct from Group I intron splicing, which involves a different pathway involving a guanine residue cofactor's 3' OH attacking the 5' phosphate of the intron.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Rolling-circle replication first generates a long multimeric RNA; an embedded hammerhead motif then catalyzes cleavage between adjacent copies to release many individual molecules.\n\nThis answer is supported by the information provided in the audio, which states that \"rolling circle replication generates a long multimeric RNA transcript.\" The audio also mentions that \"the hammerhead ribozyme is embedded within this transcript,\" indicating that it is part of the RNA molecule itself. The audio further explains that \"the hammerhead ribozyme catalyzes the cleavage between adjacent copies of the RNA,\" resulting in the release of many individual molecules. This process is consistent with option A, which describes the generation of a long multimeric RNA followed by cleavage between adjacent copies by a hammerhead ribozyme to produce individual molecules.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The blood glucose meter drops from 160 mg/dL to 90 mg/dL as insulin promotes cellular glucose uptake and inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.\n\nIn the audio between 00:04:34.469 and 00:05:46.411, the speaker discusses the effects of insulin on blood glucose levels. They mention that insulin promotes cellular glucose uptake, which leads to a decrease in blood glucose levels. Additionally, they state that insulin inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, further reducing blood glucose levels. This aligns with option A, where the blood glucose meter drops from 160 mg/dL to 90 mg/dL due to insulin's actions.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: High blood glucose overwhelms renal reabsorption, causing glucose loss in urine and pulling water with it, and the visual depicts Type 1 diabetes with absent insulin in the Type 1 panel.\n\nIn the audio, the speaker explains that high blood glucose levels cause the kidneys to reabsorb glucose, which leads to the loss of water through the urine. This process is known as osmotic diuresis. The speaker also mentions that in Type 1 diabetes, there is a lack of insulin, which further exacerbates the situation by preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing glucose effectively. The visual during this explanation shows the Type 1 panel with no insulin present, indicating the absence of insulin in the body. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe segment explains that the pharynx is divided into three parts - the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx. It also mentions that the epiglottis closes the windpipe during eating, which is supported by the diagram. This division and function of the epiglottis help in routing air and food appropriately. Option B is incorrect because the pharynx is not a single chamber but rather divided into three parts. Option C is incorrect because it states that the nose and mouth connect directly to the trachea without intermediate structures, which is not accurate. Option D is incorrect because it mentions that the epiglottis keeps the esophagus closed during breathing, which is not correct.",

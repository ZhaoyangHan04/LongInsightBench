    "model_answer": "answer: A: Because the speaker has just introduced phase variation as the central topic of the presentation, so the slide visually emphasizes it.\n\nThe speaker introduces the topic of \"Phase variation in Salmonella\" at the beginning of the video, which suggests that this is the main focus of the presentation. The term being circled in yellow likely serves to visually emphasize this topic, making it stand out from other text on the slide. This aligns with option A. Options B, C, and D do not seem relevant to the context provided by the speaker's introduction.",

The first 71 and last 46 amino acids are mentioned as being identical, which supports option A. The other options do not align with the information provided in the audio segment.",

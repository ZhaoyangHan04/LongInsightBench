    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Because chlorophyll usually masks other pigments, but when plants reclaim chlorophyll (e.g., before dropping leaves), the remaining accessory pigments become visible as reds and yellows.\n\nIn the segment, the speaker explains that chlorophyll is the dominant pigment in leaves, which gives them their green color. However, as the plant prepares to drop its leaves, it starts to break down chlorophyll. This process reveals the presence of other pigments like carotenoids, which are responsible for the red and yellow colors we see in autumn foliage. The other options are incorrect because they either misinterpret the relationship between sunlight, soil minerals, or chlorophyll levels and leaf coloration.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A: Because ATP and NADPH are produced in the light-dependent reactions and are sent onward as energy carriers for the Calvin cycle.\n\nThe audio explains that ATP and NADPH are produced during the light-dependent reactions and are used by the Calvin cycle to convert CO2 into glucose. Therefore, the diagram shows these outputs directed \"TO CALVIN CYCLE\" because they serve as energy carriers for the Calvin cycle.",

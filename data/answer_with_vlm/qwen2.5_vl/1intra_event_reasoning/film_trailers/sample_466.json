    "model_answer": "The answer is C: The fill light reduces facial shadows, revealing more detail.\n\nIn the video, the seated man's face is initially dark and lacks detail due to the lack of lighting. As the fill light is introduced, it illuminates his face, reducing the shadows and revealing more detail in his facial features. This demonstrates the purpose of the fill light in photography and videography, which is to add illumination to the subject and reduce harsh shadows. Therefore, option C is correct.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is D: The muslin diffuses the underlight for softness, and the top light is used intentionally to cast unflattering shadows that heighten drama.\n\nIn the video, the demonstrator uses white bleached muslin as a diffuser for the bottom light, which helps to soften the shadows created by the light source. This technique is often used in film and photography to create a more natural and flattering lighting effect. However, in this case, the demonstrator mentions that the top light is turned on to create unflattering shadows, which is done intentionally to heighten the drama of the scene. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.",

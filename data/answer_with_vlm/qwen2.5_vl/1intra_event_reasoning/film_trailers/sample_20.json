The audio clip is not included in the image descriptions, so it's impossible to determine the reason behind the three pigs being on a wanted poster based solely on these frames.",

The given timestamps and event_id refer to a different segment of the video, specifically the Curious George title card sequence. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine if the trailer is transitioning as described in the question.",

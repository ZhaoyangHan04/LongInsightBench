    "model_answer": "The video alternates between views labeled “Infrared” and “Visible” of the same nebula to highlight the differences in what each wavelength reveals about the same region. Infrared allows Hubble to peer through thick dust in star-forming regions, revealing the illuminated pillars and surrounding stars, which is not visible in visible light. This gives a fuller picture of the stellar birth process. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

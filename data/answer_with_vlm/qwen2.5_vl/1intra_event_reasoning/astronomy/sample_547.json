    "model_answer": "answer: A: Because a black hole with the Sun’s mass would exert the same gravitational pull at Earth’s distance, which is echoed by tranquil orbital views showing Earth with sunrises and sunsets rather than plunging inward.\n\nThe narrator explains that even if the Sun were replaced by a black hole of the same mass, Earth's orbit would remain unchanged due to the conservation of angular momentum. The tranquil orbital views showing Earth with sunrises and sunsets reinforce this point, indicating that Earth's path around the new object would not change significantly.",

The visuals in the segment show a sunset over a lake and a distant object in space, but there is no discussion or conclusion about Earth's fate in this context. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the correct answer based solely on the given information.",

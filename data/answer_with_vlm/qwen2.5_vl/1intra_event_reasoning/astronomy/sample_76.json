    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe outdoor visuals show a clear sky and the focus on the station, which contextualizes the favorable observing environment. The control room's spectrum being described as \"much better\" suggests that atmospheric noise, which is random and lower at the South Pole, has reduced interference. Therefore, option A is the most plausible reason for the improvement in the spectrum.",

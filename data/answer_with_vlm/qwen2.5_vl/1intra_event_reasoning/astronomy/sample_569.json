The segment focuses on the guest speaking about her involvement in the search for alien life but does not mention her professional background or the duration of her involvement. Therefore, it is impossible to determine which option correctly combines the on-screen identification of the guest with her spoken description of how long she has been involved in the search for alien life based solely on this audio segment.",

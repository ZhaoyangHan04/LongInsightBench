    "model_answer": "answer: A: Earth overtakes a superior planet in its orbit around the Sun, making that planet seem to backtrack briefly.\n\nThe audio discusses the concept of retrograde motion as seen from Earth, where planets like Mars appear to move backwards in their orbits. This phenomenon is explained by the fact that Earth is moving faster than these planets, and when it overtakes them, it makes them appear to move backwards. This is a key point in understanding the heliocentric model of the solar system, which was revolutionary at the time. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is D: An unnamed WWE legend; the event was invitation-only and he wasn't invited.\n\nIn the audio, it's mentioned that \"Kevin Nash was not able to attend the event due to his position with WWE.\" This implies that the event was invitation-only, and since Kevin Nash was part of WWE, he could not be invited to attend. The other options are incorrect because they either mention Sting (who is not discussed in the given time frame) or Kevin Nash, which contradicts the information provided in the audio.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: By combining multiple wagers into a single parlay for better odds if all legs hit; this aligns with the “Parlays” item shown in the FanDuel Sports Betting 101 menu.\n\nIn the audio, the presenter mentions that combining multiple wagers into a single parlay can increase potential winnings. This aligns with the \"Parlays\" option displayed in the FanDuel Sports Betting 101 menu. The other options are incorrect because they either focus on individual bets (Straight Bets) or refer to a promotional offer (Risk Free Bet) rather than a strategy for increasing potential winnings through combined wagers.",

There is no mention of \"teasers\" or their features. Therefore, it's impossible to determine which options apply based on the given information.",

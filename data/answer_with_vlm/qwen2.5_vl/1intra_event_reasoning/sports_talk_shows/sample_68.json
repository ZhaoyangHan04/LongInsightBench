    "model_answer": "answer: A: It labels the two green dots as HB and FB next to the white QB dot, while the narrator explains there are two types of running backs and that fullbacks are usually bigger whereas halfbacks are faster.\n\nThe segment clearly distinguishes between the halfback (HB) and the fullback (FB) by labeling them with different colored dots and explaining their typical roles. The narrator mentions that fullbacks are usually bigger and halfbacks are faster, which helps identify the two types of running backs. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: A field scene labeled with roles like “holder” and “kicker” is shown while the narrator explains the duties of positions such as the holder and long snapper, highlighting their specific functions.\n\nThis answer is supported by the video content where we see a field scene with labels for different positions, including \"holder\" and \"kicker,\" along with a narrator explaining their duties. This visual and verbal information directly addresses the emphasis on special teams roles, especially those of the kicker and related positions. The other options either do not match the provided video content or introduce irrelevant information that does not support the emphasis on special teams roles.",

The live demonstration visually confirms that the thrower drops to their side (sacrificing position) instead of remaining upright, which is characteristic of a sacrificing throw. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.",

The speaker discusses a technique involving a crossface and pressure near the knee/solar plexus, but there is no direct reference to Uki-gatame or its characteristics. Therefore, it's impossible to determine if the technique shown in the modern footage matches Uki-gatame based solely on this audio segment.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A: By curling his toes and striking the bottom of the ball to create backspin, then keeping a steady leftâ€“right rhythm, as seen while he alternates feet juggling the yellow-and-black ball in front of the goal.\n\nThe player is seen juggling the yellow-and-black ball in front of the goal, which indicates that he is using his feet to control the ball's movement. The player's actions suggest that he is using his toes to strike the bottom of the ball to create backspin, which would cause the ball to come back towards him. Additionally, the player is maintaining a steady left-right rhythm, which helps to keep the ball in the air for longer periods of time. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

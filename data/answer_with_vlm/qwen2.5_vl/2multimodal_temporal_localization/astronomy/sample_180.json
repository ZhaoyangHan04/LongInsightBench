The audio content seems to be about the Royal Society of Victoria and a presentation by Associate Professor Alan Duffy on \"Darkness Visible Down Under.\" There is no mention of a sodium iodide crystal detector or the principle of sailing. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine the correct time segment for the described scenario.",

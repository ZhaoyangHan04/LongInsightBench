The audio starts with the title \"MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS\" and then transitions to Dr. Jangam Sasidhar introducing himself as an Assistant Professor. There is no mention of the professor greeting \"Good morning,\" asking about simple harmonic motion, or defining periodic motion. Additionally, there is no indication that the whiteboard already shows the title \"Simple Harmonic Motion\" written in red and blue. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the correct time frame based on the given information.",

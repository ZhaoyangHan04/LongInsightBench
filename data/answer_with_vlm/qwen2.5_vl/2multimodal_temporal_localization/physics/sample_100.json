The audio content is focused on explaining how to use GNU Octave to numerically find a solution for a system of harmonic oscillators. Therefore, there is no relevant information in the audio to answer the question.",

The audio focuses on the speaker discussing the use of GNU Octave to numerically find a solution for a system of harmonic oscillators and mentions the need to add a damping term to the equations. However, it does not provide specific details about the time segment when this occurs.",

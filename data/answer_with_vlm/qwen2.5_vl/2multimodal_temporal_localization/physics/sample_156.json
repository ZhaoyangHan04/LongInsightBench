    "model_answer": "answer: Unable to answer\n\nThe provided audio clip does not contain any information about a static diffraction diagram or the narrator explaining that you can hear someone near a doorway due to wave diffraction. The content of the audio is focused on general wave properties and oscillation, without mentioning the specific scenario described in the question. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine when the static diffraction diagram appears based on the given audio.",

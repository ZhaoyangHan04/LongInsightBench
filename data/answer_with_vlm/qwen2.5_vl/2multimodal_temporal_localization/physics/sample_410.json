The content is focused on explaining the concept of a solenoid and its magnetic field, without referencing an MRI. Therefore, there is no information in the given audio to determine when the speaker might have referenced an MRI as described in the question.",

There is no mention of the lecturer explaining how a tightly wound solenoid's magnetic field can be weakened by increasing its length or by reducing the number of turns. Therefore, there is insufficient information in the given audio to answer the question accurately.",

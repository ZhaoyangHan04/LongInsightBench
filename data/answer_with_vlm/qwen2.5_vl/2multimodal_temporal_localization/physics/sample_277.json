The audio seems to be about a ball rolling on a table, which is not related to the described scenario. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine the correct time segment for the given question.",

There is no mention of a second male voice, a static chalkboard, or equations related to displacement, velocity, and acceleration. The question seems to be based on a different context than what is shown in the video frames.",

The images show a blue background with a white square containing the number \"1,987\" and the letter \"T\", followed by another white square with the number \"9,187\" and the letter \"He\". There is no '118 ELEMENTS' graphic, lab flasks, a '60%' pie chart, or human body composition percentages shown in these frames. Additionally, there are no repeated glass-breaking sounds or a brief phone ring interruption mentioned in the images.

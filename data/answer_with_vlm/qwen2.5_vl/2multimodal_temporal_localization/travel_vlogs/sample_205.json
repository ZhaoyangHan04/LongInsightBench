The video content seems to be about a woman speaking directly to the camera, but there is no mention of a black bag or Victoria's Secret Pink products. Therefore, I cannot determine at which time the described action occurs.",

The audio clips only show the woman speaking in front of a zebra print pillow. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine the correct time frame for these actions.",

    "model_answer": "answer: Unable to answer\n\nThe provided audio clips do not contain the specific sequence described in the question. The audio clips start with a presenter speaking about Harry Maguire's signing and then show promotional shots of him, but there is no mention of a world-record fee, a number five shirt, or a musical sting playing. Therefore, I cannot determine which time segment matches the description in the question.",

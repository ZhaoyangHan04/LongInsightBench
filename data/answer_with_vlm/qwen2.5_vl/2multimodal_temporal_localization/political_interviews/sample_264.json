    "model_answer": "The segment described occurs between 00:01:07 and 00:01:53. The transition from the logo to the spark-filled title card is clearly marked by the appearance of the text \"Congressman Joe Kennedy.\" This is followed by the library scene with the lower-third text and Joe Kennedy's dialogue about his college experience and advice to students. The uplifting orchestral music further confirms this timeframe as it plays throughout the scene. Therefore, the correct answer is B: [00:01:07 - 00:01:53].",

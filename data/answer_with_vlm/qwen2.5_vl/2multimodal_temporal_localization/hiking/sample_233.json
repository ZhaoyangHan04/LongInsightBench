    "model_answer": "answer: Unable to answer\n\nThe provided audio clip does not contain any mention of a man alongside a drone operator in a rocky area near a tunnel-like structure, nor does it describe a snowstorm or an engine sputtering. The audio seems to be about a construction site with a focus on water flow and concrete pouring, which does not match the described scenario. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine the correct time segment for the described scene.",

It’s Thomas the Train!”, or an aerial river view with a train. The audio clips seem to be related to construction activities and do not include the elements described in the question.",

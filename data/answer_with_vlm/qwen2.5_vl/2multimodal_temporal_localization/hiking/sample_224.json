The audio seems to be about a horse grazing in a field, which does not match the description in the question.

The audio starts with a black screen, then shows a Highland cow grazing, followed by a transition to a group of Highland cattle under trees. There is no mention of Angus cows or a distinct quality of mooing, nor is there a sign-off phrase \"over and out for a minute.\" Therefore, it's impossible to determine which segment corresponds to the described scenario.",

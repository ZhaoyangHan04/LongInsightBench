    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: [00:06:46 - 00:07:13].\n\nExplanation: The audio mentions the appearance of a gray slide titled \"Hammerhead Ribozyme\" at around 6:46, which matches the time range provided in option B. The slide includes a diagram labeled with Stem I, Stem II, Stem III, a GU-turn, and a highlighted cleavage site. The male narrator then proceeds to explain hammerhead ribozymes in viroids/rolling-circle replication and their autocatalytic cleavage that yields 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and 5'-hydroxyl termini, which aligns with the content described in the question.",

The audio clips are about ribozymes and their structures, but there is no mention of HDV, hepatitis B, or the specific details about the HDV ribozyme being listed. Therefore, it's impossible to determine which segment corresponds to the described content.",

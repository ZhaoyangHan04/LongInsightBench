    "model_answer": "The question asks about the time when the narrator states that syllables never span multiple words, which is related to the concept of syllables being defined by the sounds at the beginning (or end) of a word. The visuals provided include stick figures interacting with blue ovals labeled \"CV\" and a figure holding a blue oval containing three smaller ovals emitting colored sound waves. This suggests that the content is discussing syllable structure and how it relates to the sounds within words.\n\nThe audio segment that discusses this topic is between 00:05:11 and 00:05:38. In this segment, the narrator explains that syllables are defined by the sounds at the beginning (or end) of a word, and that these sounds are also at the beginning (or end) of a syllable. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: A: [00:05:11 - 00:05:38]",

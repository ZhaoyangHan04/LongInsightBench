The frames show a glass container with a liquid inside, but there is no context of the experiment being described in the question. Therefore, I cannot determine the correct time segment based on the given information.",

The content seems to focus on a different chemical reaction involving a brownish substance in a glass container. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine which segment corresponds to the described scenario.",

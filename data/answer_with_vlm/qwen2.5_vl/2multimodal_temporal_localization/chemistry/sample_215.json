The audio content is focused on explaining spontaneous reactions in thermodynamics and does not include the described visual and auditory elements. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the correct time segment based on the given information.",

The speaker is discussing spontaneous reactions in general, not specifically reversible reactions involving hydrated and anhydrous copper sulfate. Therefore, there is insufficient information to select any of the given time segments.",

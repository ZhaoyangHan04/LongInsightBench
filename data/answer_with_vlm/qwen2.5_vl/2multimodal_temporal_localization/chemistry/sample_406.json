The descriptions only mention the title of the video and some illustrations related to chemical compounds. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine when this specific event occurs in the video.",

The video is focused on quantifying chemical compounds using various tools like beakers, test tubes, and a balance. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nanswer: Unable to answer\n\nExplanation: The video content does not match the description of the question, which asks about a specific topic (atomic radius and ions) that is not present in the given video segments.",

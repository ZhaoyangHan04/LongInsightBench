    "model_answer": "answer: D: Event 4 (preceding sub-event): The Gander RV dump station was full, forcing them to find an alternative location to dump.\n\nThe speaker mentions in the audio that they had to pay $10 to dump their tanks at an RV resort across the street. This implies that the Gander RV dump station was full, which is the most direct cause of having to find an alternative location to dump. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "answer: C: Event 6: The bedroom slide had been leaking for a while, causing mold; the slide, flooring, and carpet needed replacing, with an estimated 18 hours of work and $3,500 in materials.\n\nReasoning: Event 6 describes a significant issue with the bedroom slide that required extensive repairs, including replacement of the slide, flooring, and carpet. This extensive work would likely take several days to complete, which aligns with the conclusion that the RV will spend about five or six days in the maintenance bay. The other events mentioned do not directly relate to the maintenance bay or the specific issue described in Event 6.",

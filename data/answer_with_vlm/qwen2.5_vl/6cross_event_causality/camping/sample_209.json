    "model_answer": "answer: A, C, D\n\nThe speaker's emphasis on closing tank levers and carefully removing caps to avoid a sudden \"swoosh\" suggests that there may be residual liquid that could unexpectedly escape. This aligns with events where the speaker mentions that water can get trapped in hoses and that there is still some liquid left after closing the tanks. Therefore, events A, C, and D are the most plausible as they show that residual liquid can remain and escape unexpectedly.",

This conclusion would have been reached after performing several steps, including adding refrigerant in measured increments, allowing the system to stabilize, and dialing in the subcool to the manufacturer's recommendation while monitoring gauges. These actions are described in event 12, which directly enables the final verification of proper operation.",

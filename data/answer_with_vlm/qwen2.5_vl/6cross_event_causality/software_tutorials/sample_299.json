    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 4 â€” Implemented a central GameEvents singleton and a DoorwayTriggerEnter dispatcher that other scripts can access without holding direct references.\n\nExplanation: The narrator mentions that the system's resilience comes from the fact that it is the single dependency. This implies that the system is designed to be independent of other components, which aligns with the implementation of a central GameEvents singleton and a DoorwayTriggerEnter dispatcher. These components allow scripts to access the event system without holding direct references, thus reducing dependencies on other parts of the game. Therefore, Event 4 is the step that primarily caused the decoupled resilience of the event system.",

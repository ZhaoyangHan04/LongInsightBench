    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Fraying/splaying the wire ends, interlocking them like fingers, twisting each side for a compact joint, then clamping in jaws before soldering (Event 4).\n\nReasoning: The process of fraying the wire ends, interlocking them, and twisting them together creates a compact joint that provides a strong base for the subsequent steps. This step ensures that the wires are properly aligned and ready for soldering, which is crucial for creating a secure and waterproof connection. The other steps mentioned in the options either precede or follow the described process but do not directly enable the specific sealed result as described in the question.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Fraying/splaying, interlocking, and twisting each side to create a compact, mechanically sound joint before soldering (Event 4).\n\nReasoning: The instructor's comment about the solder joint looking \"pretty good\" suggests that the preparation steps were effective in creating a strong connection. Option C describes the specific actions taken to prepare the wires before soldering, which would directly contribute to the quality of the solder joint. Options A and B describe preparatory steps but are not as directly related to the quality of the solder joint itself. Option D is unrelated to the soldering process and does not pertain to the quality of the solder joint.",

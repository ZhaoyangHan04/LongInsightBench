    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Quitting Disk Utility to return to macOS Recovery and choosing “Reinstall macOS” to install onto the new bootable drive (event 8).\n\nReasoning: The sequence of events provided indicates that the user has already erased and formatted the external SSD as a boot drive (event 7), which is necessary for the installation process. The next logical step would be to quit Disk Utility and proceed to the macOS Recovery environment where the \"Reinstall macOS\" option is available (event 8). This action would enable the system to reinstall macOS on the newly prepared boot drive, which is consistent with the \"Migration Complete\" confirmation displayed in event 9.",

    "model_answer": "answer: C: Preparing the external SSD by erasing it and naming it “Boot Drive” in Disk Utility (event 7).\n\nThe user needs to select \"Macintosh HD\" as the startup disk to ensure the computer boots from the intended drive. This implies that the user has already prepared the external SSD by erasing it and naming it \"Boot Drive\" in Disk Utility (event 7). The other events mentioned don't directly relate to preparing the external drive for use as a startup disk.",

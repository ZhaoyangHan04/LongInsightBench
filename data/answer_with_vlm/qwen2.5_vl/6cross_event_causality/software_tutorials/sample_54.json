    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 6: Zooming into the peak, including background on both sides, then using non-linear Gaussian fitting until convergence to obtain the FWHM parameter (w).\n\nExplanation: The speaker mentions obtaining FWHM values for two peaks in event 10. This implies that the FWHM values were calculated from the data. Event 6 describes the process of zooming into the peak, including the background on both sides, and using non-linear Gaussian fitting until convergence to obtain the FWHM parameter (w). This action would enable the calculation of FWHM values for the peaks, which aligns with the speaker's announcement in event 10.",

The images show an XRD pattern and a Gaussian fit, but there is no indication of the process used to reach this point. Therefore, it's impossible to determine which events directly led to the final display based on the given information.",

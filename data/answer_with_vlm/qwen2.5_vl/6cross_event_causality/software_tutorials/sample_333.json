    "model_answer": "answer: A: Event 2: The speaker highlights that the 250D has exceptional autofocus and stresses understanding AF functions after introducing 4Kâ€™s limits (blue 'Auto Focus' interlude).\n\nThe speaker in the video discusses the autofocus capabilities of the Canon EOS 250D, which is the camera being used in the demonstration. In Event 2, the speaker mentions the exceptional autofocus of the camera and emphasizes the importance of understanding the autofocus functions. This sets up the context for the face-tracking demonstration in Event 4, as the speaker is likely to build upon the previous discussion about autofocus by demonstrating its specific features, such as face tracking. Therefore, Event 2 is the most direct lead-up to the face-tracking demonstration in Event 4.",

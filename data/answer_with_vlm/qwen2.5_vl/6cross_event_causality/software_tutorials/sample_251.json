The use of color and symbols is directly related to the pen size, color choices, and highlighter options shown in Event 5. Additionally, the explanation of a tiered signifier system in Event 8 provides a foundation for organizing levels of detail, which could be applied to the color-coded method. Lastly, the presentation of GoodNotes' organization system in Event 3 would have motivated the creator to keep all class materials in one app, which is essential for the structured note-taking method demonstrated later.",

    "model_answer": "answer: C: Event 4: Demonstrates and adopts CSS scroll-padding-top (e.g., trying 300px) so that anchor jumps can be offset by padding rather than being hidden under the sticky nav.\n\nThe presenter in the video confirms that the sections now align correctly beneath the sticky navigation after clicking links, which implies that the scroll-padding-top has been implemented successfully. This is because the scroll-padding-top property is used to create space between the top of the viewport and the top of the content, preventing the content from being covered by the navigation bar. Therefore, the correct alignment of sections beneath the sticky navigation is a result of implementing the scroll-padding-top property.",

This indicates that the previous step involved trying a fixed value and realizing its limitations, which is a logical progression before writing JavaScript to measure the navigation height.",

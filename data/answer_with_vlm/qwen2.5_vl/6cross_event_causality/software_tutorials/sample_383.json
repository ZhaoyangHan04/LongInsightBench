    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe presenter mentions in the audio that they manually constrained the AT&T gateway's DHCP server to a single IP address reserved for the home router in LAN > DHCP (event 4). This action would have effectively limited the AT&T gateway's ability to assign IP addresses, which could necessitate disabling the Wi-Fi radios to prevent conflicts with the home router's IP address assignment. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.",

The audio only mentions configuring the U-verse modem and does not discuss the configuration of the ASUS router or the AT&T gateway. Therefore, it is impossible to determine which earlier actions provided the configuration basis and made the static setup necessary.",

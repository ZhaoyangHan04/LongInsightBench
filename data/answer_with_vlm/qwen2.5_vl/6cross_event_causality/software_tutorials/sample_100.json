    "model_answer": "answer: B\n\nThe presenter mentions that the smooth lift-and-return of the slide under the airgun test is due to the prior steps of expanding/seating the diaphragm fully, aligning the spring locator and raised dowels, and verifying free up-down movement before closing the cap. This ensures that all components are properly aligned and functioning correctly, which enables the smooth operation of the slide.",

    "model_answer": "answer: B: Event 5: Ensuring the diaphragm is seated all the way around and aligning the spring locator and raised dowels before placing the cap.\n\nExplanation: The presenter's statement suggests that the cap should not bend enough to cause a leak, which implies that the cap was properly aligned and seated. This would be a result of ensuring the diaphragm is seated all the way around and aligning the spring locator and raised dowels before placing the cap (Event 5). Therefore, this action would have made it safe for the presenter to let go without causing a leak.",

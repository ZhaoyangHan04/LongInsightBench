    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Event 2 â€” Choosing Tools > Prepare Form for the current file and clicking Start (not scanning a different document).\n\nExplanation: The process of converting a Word document to a PDF and saving it as \"Conference 2017.pdf\" (Event 0) does not directly enable the automatic detection of form fields by Acrobat. Similarly, opening the PDF in Acrobat and noting it is ready to be turned into a form (Event 1) does not initiate the automatic detection either. However, choosing Tools > Prepare Form for the current file and clicking Start (Event 2) initiates the process where Acrobat analyzes the document and identifies form fields automatically. This step is necessary before any further actions like renaming fields, adding tooltips, or marking them as required can be performed. Therefore, Event 2 forms the causal chain that enables the automatic detection and subsequent editing of form fields in Acrobat.",

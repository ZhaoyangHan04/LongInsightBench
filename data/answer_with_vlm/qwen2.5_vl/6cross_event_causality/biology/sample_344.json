    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 4: Activated rhodopsin activates phosphodiesterase, converting cGMP to GMP and reducing cGMP available to keep cyclic nucleotide-gated Na+ channels open.\n\nExplanation: The process described in Event 4 leads to the closure of sodium (Na+) channels in the photoreceptor cells, which results in hyperpolarization and a decrease in neurotransmitter release. This is because the reduction in cGMP (a second messenger) levels due to the activation of phosphodiesterase causes the closing of the Na+ channels, leading to hyperpolarization and reduced neurotransmitter release.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 7: Retinal ganglion cell axons travel in the optic nerves to the optic chiasm, where nasal (medial) retinal axons cross to the contralateral side.\n\nThis event forms the primary causal pathway delivering signals to the point where the visual processing splits into a dorsal \"where\" stream and a ventral \"what\" stream. The optic chiasm is the location where the axons from the two eyes cross over to the opposite side of the brain, which is necessary for the separation of visual information into different streams.",

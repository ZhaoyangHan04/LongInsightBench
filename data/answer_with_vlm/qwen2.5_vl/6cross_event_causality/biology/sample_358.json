    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 7.\n\nExplanation: In Event 7, the presenter discusses the structural differences between FliC and FliB flagellins, highlighting their conserved ends and divergent surface-exposed regions with distinct antigenicities. This sets the stage for understanding how Salmonella switches between these two flagellins, which is crucial for the immune evasion strategy described in the conclusion. The mention of the switching frequency (10^-3 to 10^-5 per generation) further supports the idea that this switching mechanism is a key factor in the immune evasion strategy. Therefore, Event 7 directly explains how Salmonella switches between antigenically distinct flagellins and the genetic mechanism enabling that switch, which is essential for understanding the advantage provided by phase variation in delaying the host immune response.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe speaker mentions that flagellin B is not synthesized while flagellin C is expressed. This indicates a switch between the two flagellins. Event 8 describes a mechanism where Hin recombinase flips the promoter orientation, turning off the fljB operon (which codes for flagellin B) and allowing the alternate flagellin (fliC) to be expressed. Therefore, it is most likely that Event 8 is the preceding event that causes the ON-OFF outcome for the two flagellin types.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe speaker explains that the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells (Event 8) leads to reduced insulin production (Event 7). Without insulin's lowering effect (Event 6), blood glucose levels remain elevated, resulting in polyuria (Event 9). Polyuria causes excessive water loss from the body, which eventually leads to dehydration (Event 10). This sequence of events directly sets up the outcome of dehydration in the context of Type 1 diabetes.",

Both options A and B align with this discussion by mentioning the role of insulin resistance, elevated blood glucose levels, and their effects on blood vessels leading to cardiovascular disease and impaired wound healing. Option C and D are not directly related to the outcomes mentioned in Event 15.",

    "model_answer": "answer: B, C, D\n\nThe narrator's assertion about phospholipids forming a bilayer in water and all biological membranes being phospholipid bilayers is built upon the foundational knowledge presented in events B, C, and D. \n\nEvent B introduces amphipathic fatty acids and describes phospholipids as having a hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tails, which is crucial for understanding how they arrange themselves in water. Event C provides a detailed diagram of phosphatidylcholine with a charged, hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic tails, illustrating the bilayer arrangement. Event D further reinforces this concept by showing a bilayer diagram with labeled hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails, emphasizing its role in maintaining homeostasis. These events collectively lay the necessary groundwork for the conclusion drawn in event 10.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A, C\n\nEvent 4 provided the foundational explanation of saturated vs. unsaturated fatty acids, highlighting how double bonds create kinks that prevent tight packing, leading to rigidity. Event 5 further elaborated on the properties of unsaturated fatty acids, specifically mentioning their low melting points and liquid state at room temperature, which supports the conclusion about fluidity. Events 2 and 3 did not directly contribute to the conclusion about fluidity as they focused on general lipid properties and triglyceride synthesis, respectively.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A, C\n\nThe emphasis on echinoderms being part of the deuterostome lineage in event 10 is most likely due to the previous discussions on protostomes and deuterostomes in event 7, which explains the development sequences and distinctions between these two lineages. Additionally, event 5's focus on body symmetry, particularly radial vs. bilateral symmetry, would have provided foundational knowledge necessary for understanding the classification of echinoderms as deuterostomes.",

This would have provided the necessary background knowledge for the audience to understand the significance of nematodes having pseudocoeloms and a complete digestive system.",

    "model_answer": "answer: C: During blotting, applying secondary antibodies so the bound primary antibody can be seen on the membrane (event 9)\n\nThe question asks about the sub-event that made the bands visible on the Western blot membrane. The process of Western blot involves several steps, including running proteins through SDS-PAGE, transferring them onto a membrane, and then detecting the presence of specific proteins using antibodies. The final step in this process is the application of secondary antibodies which bind to the primary antibodies that have recognized the target protein. This binding makes the target protein visible on the membrane. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Identifying AMH as a male-associated marker and showing an AMH band on a Western blot (event 3: AMH 60 kDa vs actin 42 kDa). This sub-event directly enables the conclusion that scientists could detect AMH in male blood but not in female blood using a Western blot. The other options are not directly related to the conclusion drawn in event 11.",

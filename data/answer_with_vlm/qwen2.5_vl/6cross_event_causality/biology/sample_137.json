    "model_answer": "answer: A, B\n\nEvent 7 visually shows pea pods and various seeds labeled \"Legume or pod\" and \"Non-endospermic,\" while the narration discusses fruit and seed features. This directly sets up the conclusion that Fabaceae yields seed/pod resources and are worthwhile to cultivate due to their oil content. Event 1 shows root nodule formation with rhizobia on root hairs, paired with narration about nitrogen-fixing bacteria and the benefit of growing them to enrich soil. This also supports the idea that Fabaceae is valuable to cultivate as it provides benefits beyond just seed/pod resources. Events 4 and 0 do not directly relate to the economic importance of Fabaceae for oil production.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A and B\n\nEvent 6 provides information on the corolla structure of Fabaceae, which is crucial for understanding how insects interact with the flowers. The standard petal, wing petal, and keel petal arrangement may attract specific pollinators like bees. Event 4 explains the racemose inflorescence, which is a common type of flower arrangement in Fabaceae, and the pedicellate flowers along an unbranched axis could be easily accessed by insects. Therefore, these two events most plausibly explain insect-mediated pollination in Fabaceae.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A, B, C.\n\nExplanation:\n- **Option A** describes the initial setup of the porous pot experiment, which is essential for understanding the subsequent events. It establishes the context and the tools used in the experiment.\n  \n- **Option B** explains the principle behind the pressure change observed during the hydrogen trial. This principle involves the concept of diffusion and the resulting pressure differences, which is crucial for understanding how the gas feed switch to carbon dioxide will affect the system.\n\n- **Option C** directly addresses the transition from hydrogen to carbon dioxide in the experiment. It's the immediate action that leads to the pressure change and the shift in the U-tube levels.\n\n- **Option D** is not relevant to the question because it discusses diffusion in solids, which is unrelated to the gas diffusion process in the porous pot experiment.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, and C are the correct choices as they directly relate to setting up and explaining the outcome of switching the gas feed to carbon dioxide in the porous pot experiment.",

The question asks for specific sub-events that caused the mixture to become homogeneous, but there's no mention of these events in the given audio clips. Therefore, I cannot determine which sub-events most directly caused the result based on the available information.",

Therefore, there is insufficient context to determine which event(s) most directly set up the causal basis for the 100% chance of all offspring being affected in the final frame.",

    "model_answer": "answer: C\n\nThe question asks which event/sub-event most plausibly builds the causal basis for the high percentage outcome in Event 9. Event 8 provides the necessary context by explaining the concept of X-linked recessive inheritance, specifically mentioning that males can only inherit one of two X chromosomes from their mother, which is crucial for understanding the higher likelihood of X-linked recessive traits being expressed in males. This information directly supports the high percentage outcome in Event 9.",

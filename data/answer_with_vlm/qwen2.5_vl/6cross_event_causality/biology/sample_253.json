This visual representation, combined with the narration explaining how gene-environment interactions play a role in the obesity epidemic, provides the necessary context for the presenter to draw the final bullet point about the interaction between high genetic risk and a changed food environment.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 6: The GWAS segment showing over 100 obesity-associated loci and overlap with syndromic appetite genes, establishing a broad set of common risk variants to aggregate.\n\nExplanation: In event 6, the presenter discusses the GWAS results which identified over 100 obesity-associated loci and their overlap with syndromic appetite genes. This information establishes a broad set of common risk variants that can be aggregated into a polygenic risk score (PRS), which is essential for drawing conclusions about its predictive value. Events 7 and C focus on the aggregation process and the motivation behind it but do not directly enable the assertion about the predictive value of PRS. Event 3, on the other hand, provides an example of a rare monogenic mechanism, which is unrelated to the predictive value of PRS.",

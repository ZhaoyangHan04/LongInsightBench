    "model_answer": "answer: A, B, and C\n\nReasoning: \n\nEvent 9 provides the direct prerequisites by detailing the electron transport chain, H+ accumulation, and the formation of ATP and NADPH, which are essential for the Calvin cycle. Event 10 explains the water splitting process and the role of NADPH as a carrier, which is also crucial for the Calvin cycle. Event 7 offers an overview of the two stages of photosynthesis, including the fact that ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent stage drive glucose formation in the next stage, which is the Calvin cycle. Event 12, however, discusses C3 vs. C4 plants and their strategies for fixing carbon, which is not directly related to the transition to the Calvin cycle. Therefore, the correct options are A, B, and C.",

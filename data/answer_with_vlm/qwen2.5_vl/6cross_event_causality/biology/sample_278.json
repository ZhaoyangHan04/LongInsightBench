    "model_answer": "Answer: A, B\n\nThe emphasis on skeletal muscle striations and multiple nuclei is set up by contrasting it with smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Event 4 provides a visual and audio description of smooth muscle, highlighting its non-striated, narrow fusiform fibers with single nuclei, which contrasts with skeletal muscle's striations and multiple nuclei. Similarly, Event 6 provides a visual and audio description of cardiac muscle, emphasizing its branched fibers with intercalated discs and a single central nucleus, further contrasting with skeletal muscle's characteristics. Therefore, both events A and B directly set up the emphasis on skeletal muscle by establishing contrasting features of the other muscle types.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A, B\n\nEvent 11 provides a visual diagram and audio explanation of the method for naming skeletal muscles, including location and direction of fibers. This establishes the naming framework. Event 12 then follows up with a visual highlight of the naming categories and explicitly introduces \"intercostal muscles,\" clarifying that \"costal\" refers to the rib area. These two events together establish the naming framework and the meaning of \"costal,\" leading to the conclusion that intercostal muscles are the muscles between the ribs. Events 10 and 8 do not directly contribute to this conclusion.",

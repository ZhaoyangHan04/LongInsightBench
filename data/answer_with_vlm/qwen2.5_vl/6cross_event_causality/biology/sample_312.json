The audio only mentions the term \"Nematoda\" and shows nematode specimens, but it does not provide any details about the anatomy or reproductive processes of nematodes. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine which anatomical sub-events most directly enabled the outcome of a female nematode carrying developing young.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A, C, D\n\nExplanation: \n- **Event 4** describes the narrator giving step-by-step instructions for the lithotomy position, which involves abducting the thighs, flexing the knees and hips, and raising the legs into stirrups. This aligns with the patient's legs being elevated and secured in a mechanical device.\n- **Event 3** shows the screen labeling \"Lithotomy Position,\" indicating the intended posture for the upcoming procedure, which would logically precede the actual execution of the position.\n- **Event 1** describes the narrator explaining supine positioning, where the patient is secured with black straps on the operating table. This sets the stage for the patient to be positioned for the lithotomy procedure, which includes elevating the legs.\n- **Event 2** discusses bed adjustments and warnings about shoulder braces, but it does not directly relate to the patient's legs being elevated and secured in a mechanical device. Therefore, it is not the most direct cause of the outcome described in the question.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A, C, D\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe audio mentions that the team is preparing a prone Jackknife/Kraske setup with padding, which is a specific type of patient positioning. This setup is likely chosen based on the patient's condition and the need for access to certain areas of the body, such as the perianal region. The narrator also discusses prone-position variations and their relevance to perianal regions, emphasizing the importance of careful patient positioning practices and padding/alignment before making any changes to the patient's position. Therefore, option A is relevant.\n\nOption C is also correct because it mentions the supine-position overview and the use of black straps to secure the patient, which establishes standard restraint protocols that will be carried forward into more complex prone modifications. This implies that the team has already established a foundation of safety measures in the supine position, which they will build upon when transitioning to the prone position.\n\nOption D is also correct because it mentions the explanation of a gravity-assisted position for lower abdominal/pelvic access and the warning about shoulder braces' brachial plexus risk. This indicates that the team is aware of the potential risks associated with shoulder bracing and is taking steps to mitigate them by using a gravity-assisted position. This is",

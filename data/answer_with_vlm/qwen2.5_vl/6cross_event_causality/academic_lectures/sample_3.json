The video only shows a gloved hand holding a vial of blood and a slide, but there is no indication of the steps taken before this point. Therefore, it's impossible to determine which preceding steps most directly enabled a good smear to form based on the given information.",

The question asks about events that occurred prior to the final drying step, but the audio only provides information about the final steps of the staining process. Therefore, it is impossible to determine which earlier actions made the final drying step appropriate based solely on the given audio.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 8.\n\nExplanation: Event 8 discusses phonological changes in AAVE, specifically TH substitutions and consonant cluster simplification. It also mentions that people tend to notice grammar differences first, which primes the audience for the subsequent discussion of grammar-focused examples. This sets up the necessity of the conclusion that it wouldn't make sense to label AAVE as wrong, as the examples provided are meant to demonstrate that AAVE has its own distinct linguistic features rather than being a flawed version of standard English.",

This event explicitly names the classic Papez circuit and uses concurrent brain-model visuals, which directly supports the claim about the Papez circuit being the bridge between different systems.\n- **Event 6** involves visual labeling and narration of limbic lobe cortical components such as the cingulate gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus, including the uncus. This establishes the cortical limbic targets within the circuit, which is necessary for understanding how these areas contribute to the circuit's function.\n- **Event 4** explains the role of the hypothalamus in maintaining homeostasis through endocrine and autonomic influences. This event provides foundational knowledge about the hypothalamus's function, which is crucial for understanding its role in the broader context of the Papez circuit and its connection to emotional, endocrine, visceral, and voluntary responses.\n\nEvent 3 does not provide a functional circuit linking emotional to endocrine/visceral responses; it only shows",

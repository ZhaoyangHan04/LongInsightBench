    "model_answer": "answer: A, B, C\n\nThe speaker in the audio is discussing Complexity Theory and its relation to a post-Newtonian paradigm. The question asks us to identify the segments that laid the groundwork for this conclusion. \n\nOption A covers events 4-5, which introduce nonlinearity and chaos, showing \"Nonlinear Systems Theory,\" weather/fluids, and butterfly/tornado visuals. This aligns well with the speaker's mention of nonlinearity as a major theme, which is a key aspect of Complexity Theory.\n\nOption B covers events 6-7, where the speaker moves away from equilibrium and linear thinking towards feedback-driven change, paired with the \"Nonlinear Systems\" arc and cross-disciplinary icons (physics/math/chemistry). This also supports the idea of a shift from Newtonian to post-Newtonian paradigms.\n\nOption C covers events 16-17, where the speaker explicitly frames an emerging post-Newtonian paradigm, with visuals of Newtonian tools and a timeline, and mentions Scholarpedia and the need to extend to nonlinear systems. This directly supports the conclusion about Complexity Theory being a post-Newtonian paradigm.\n\nOption D covers events 1-2, which discuss self-organization and emergence with birds and hexagons.",

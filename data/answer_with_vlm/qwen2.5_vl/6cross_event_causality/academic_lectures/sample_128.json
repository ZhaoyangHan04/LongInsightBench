    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 10.\n\nReasoning: The question asks about events that would have caused London to become the main educational hub of England before the transition to \"04 LITERARY WORKS.\" Event 10 discusses cultural development and mentions that education moved outside the church and led to the founding of schools and universities. This aligns well with the idea that London became a major educational center due to these developments. While Event 9 also discusses cultural development and the Crusades, it focuses more on the importation of Greek and Roman texts rather than the establishment of schools and universities. Event 11 talks about Cambridge and Oxford but does not specifically mention London becoming the main educational hub. Event 13 introduces literary works but does not discuss the development of education leading up to it. Therefore, Event 10 provides the most plausible context for the development described in the question.",

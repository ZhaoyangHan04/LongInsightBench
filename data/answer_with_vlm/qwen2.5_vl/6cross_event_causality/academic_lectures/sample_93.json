    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Event 8 — The speaker writes the formula “magnetic bearing = True bearing + magnetic declination,” then sets up and begins calculating “94° + 23° 01'” on a calculator.\n\nExplanation: The speaker in the audio is explaining how to calculate a magnetic bearing by adding the true bearing to the magnetic declination. This calculation is directly related to the formula mentioned in Event 8. Therefore, Event 8 is the most direct enabling factor for the final result of the magnetic bearing being calculated and written down as \"117° 01'\".",

    "model_answer": "answer: C\n\nThe speaker mentions that they will cover true bearing and magnetic bearing, which implies that the true bearing has already been calculated before the magnetic bearing. In event 7, the speaker identifies and writes the mean magnetic declination as “23° 01 West,” which is the second value needed in the formula. Therefore, it's plausible that the equation was constructed based on the information provided in event 7.",

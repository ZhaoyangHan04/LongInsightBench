    "model_answer": "answer: A, B, C\n\nThe presenter's demonstration of dominant versus recessive alleles is built upon several earlier events. In Event 1, the speaker introduces traits and provides examples, which sets the stage for understanding genetic inheritance. In Event 3, the focus shifts to the DNA strand and genes, which are the carriers of hereditary information. This is further elaborated upon in Event 4, where alleles are defined as one of the two in a gene pair, and the concept of dominance and recessiveness is introduced. Therefore, Events 1, 3, and 4 are the most relevant in setting up the demonstration of dominant versus recessive alleles.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A, B, C\n\nThe presenter's summary in event 6 builds upon the information presented in events 3, 4, and 5. In event 3, the whiteboard shows a section of the DNA strand labeled \"GENES,\" and the speaker explains that genes code for specific traits and are found on chromosomes. This directly relates to the summary in event 6 about DNA having genes and being found on chromosomes. In event 4, the presenter clearly defines DNA, genes, and alleles, reinforcing the concept of alleles being dominant or recessive, which is also mentioned in the summary. Finally, in event 5, the presenter provides a detailed walkthrough of dominant vs. recessive alleles using \"DARK\" and \"LIGHT\" allele pairs and chromosome drawings, which directly supports the summary in event 6. Event 1, however, does not provide any information related to the summary in event 6.",

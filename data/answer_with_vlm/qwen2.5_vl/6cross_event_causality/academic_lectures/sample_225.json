This understanding would logically lead to the development of a method for identifying syllable boundaries based on word edges, as described in option A. The other options do not directly relate to the speaker's claim about a word-boundary method for finding syllables.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: The defense that syllables do exist in practice—referencing poetry and babies’ rhythmic mouth movements—and that people have intuitive syllable sense (event 2: glowing book, ‘Syllable?’ visuals, Earth with ‘Syllable’ thought bubble; audio reassures and defends existence).\n\nThis option aligns with the narration's statement that a modern conception of the syllable began to take form despite earlier skepticism. The reference to poetry and babies' rhythmic mouth movements suggests a practical demonstration of syllable existence, which could have challenged earlier skepticism. The visuals and text slide about syllable boundaries further support this idea by providing evidence of syllable boundaries in practice.",

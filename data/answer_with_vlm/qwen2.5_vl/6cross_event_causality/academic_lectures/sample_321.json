    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe speaker in Event 4 introduces the Inito Fertility Monitor and mentions a 15% off coupon code (\"MYINITO15\"). This recommendation and discount are most likely motivated by the information provided in Event 3, where she discusses the difficulty of pinpointing ovulation, shows cycle diagrams/calendars, and states that period apps and cervical mucus tracking can be unreliable. The Inito Fertility Monitor is presented as a solution to these challenges, making it a relevant product to recommend. Therefore, option A is the most plausible motivation for the recommendation and discount.",

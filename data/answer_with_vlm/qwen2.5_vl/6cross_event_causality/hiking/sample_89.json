    "model_answer": "answer: A, B, C, D\n\nThe audio describes the process of converting a Google Earth walk plan into a GPX format using GPSBabel. The steps mentioned in the question directly relate to the process described:\n\n- Option A is relevant because saving the Google Earth walk plan as a KML file is necessary for conversion.\n- Option B is relevant because GPSBabel needs to be installed and configured correctly to perform the conversion.\n- Option C is relevant because connecting the Garmin device ensures that the computer recognizes it, allowing for data transfer.\n- Option D is relevant because configuring GPSBabel's preferences with the required formats (KML and GPX) is essential for the conversion to work properly.\n\nTherefore, all these steps are directly related to enabling the successful translation displayed by GPSBabel.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Converting the Google Earth KML walk plan to a GPX file in GPSBabel after setting appropriate formats (events 3–4).\n\nExplanation: The narrator mentions converting the Google Earth KML walk plan to a GPX file using GPSBabel, which is necessary before uploading the file to the Garmin eTrex 20. This conversion process is essential for the file to be compatible with the Garmin device. Therefore, this action would lead to the on-device display of the uploaded walk route when the narrator says, “And there it is.”",

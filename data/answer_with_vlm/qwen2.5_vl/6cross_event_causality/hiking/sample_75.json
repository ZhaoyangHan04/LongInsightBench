The audio only shows a person speaking about their activities in a stream and a backyard, but there is no mention of a digital scale displaying a weight reading or any actions leading up to such a reading.

The audio starts with a black screen and transitions into a scene of a stream, but there is no mention of the narrator's previous statements or the conclusion of the session. Therefore, I cannot determine which earlier moments best explain why the narrator references three days and is concluding the session.",

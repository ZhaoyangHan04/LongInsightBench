    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 7. \n\nThe presenter in Event 7 demonstrates the effect of fixing psi at 165° and rotating phi, showing yellow/red clash markers and a \"Clash!\" inset. This directly leads to the conclusion that many phi angles would be impossible due to atoms getting too close, as mentioned by the narrator. This observation aligns with the conclusion drawn in Event 11 about the physical impossibility of certain phi angles when psi is fixed at 0°.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 8: The Ramachandran plot is introduced; the narrator highlights clusters corresponding to alpha helices and beta strands, and the visuals show where these regions lie on the phi/psi axes.\n\nThis answer is supported by the information provided in the audio, which mentions the Ramachandran plot and its relation to the allowed psi regions for alpha helices and beta strands. The Ramachandran plot is a tool used to visualize the possible values of phi (φ) and psi (ψ) angles for protein residues, and it helps identify the regions where these angles are allowed without causing atomic clashes. Therefore, the introduction of the Ramachandran plot in Event 8 would be the most direct enabling factor for identifying the no-clash psi windows for alpha helices and beta strands.",

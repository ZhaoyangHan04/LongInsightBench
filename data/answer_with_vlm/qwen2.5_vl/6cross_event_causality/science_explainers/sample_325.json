    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe narrator in Event 12 makes a comparison between the number of antigens in a syringe and those in a baby's diaper. This claim is most directly supported by Event 11, where the speaker explains that immediately after birth, the child's body is colonized by many bacteria, which implies a significant challenge to the immune system. The visual diagram of body sites and the audio on immune reactions to numerous bacterial species in Event 11 set up the context for the comparison made in Event 12.",

    "model_answer": "answer: C\n\nThe conclusion presented in Event 10 aligns with the findings of a 2013 CDC study mentioned in Event 9, which showed that children with the highest antigen exposure performed better on attention and executive function tests. This study directly addresses the \"too many, too soon\" concern by providing evidence that contradicts the notion that receiving more vaccines at a younger age negatively impacts neuropsychological outcomes. Therefore, it's plausible that the evidence from Event 9 influenced the presentation and support of the conclusion in Event 10.",

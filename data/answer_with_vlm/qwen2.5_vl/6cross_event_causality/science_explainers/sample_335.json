    "model_answer": "answer: A, B, C, D\n\nThe speaker mentions being impressed by the Rotterdam study in Event 8, which suggests the benefits of Vitamin K2. In Event 10, he explains the differences between Vitamin K1 and K2 and the high K2 content in fermented foods, which could have influenced his decision. Event 3 discusses the risks associated with calcium intake, which might have motivated him to look for safer alternatives. Lastly, Event 11 talks about the potential K2 deficiency in Western diets due to declining quality of animal products, which could have reinforced his decision to supplement with Vitamin K2. Therefore, all these events seem to be directly related to the speaker's decision to start supplementing with Vitamin K2 and incorporating more fermented foods into his diet.",

    "model_answer": "answer: B, C\n\nThe speaker in event 7 is discussing the role of Vitamin K2 in the bone-heart connection, specifically how it activates osteocalcin to move calcium from blood into bone (event 5). This is followed by an explanation about matrix GLA proteins in vessel walls requiring Vitamin K2 to remove calcium from tissues (event 6), which leads to vascular calcification when K2 is lacking. These points directly prompt the speaker to ask if increasing Vitamin K2 could be helpful, as he has just explained the importance of K2 in these processes.",

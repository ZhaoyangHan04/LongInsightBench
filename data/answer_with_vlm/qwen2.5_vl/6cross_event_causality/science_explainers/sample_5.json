    "model_answer": "answer: B: Event 3 â€” Audio recounts real-world solar storms (1859 telegraphs, 1989 Quebec grid, GPS risks), with visuals of auroras, close-ups of electrical equipment, and satellites around Earth, evidencing infrastructure vulnerability.\n\nThe narrator in Event 3 provides historical examples of solar storms affecting telegraphs, power grids, and GPS systems, which directly builds the causal basis for the warning about the potential impact of a strong solar storm on modern connectivity and vulnerable services like water supply. The visuals of auroras, electrical equipment, and satellites further illustrate the infrastructure vulnerabilities mentioned in the warning. Therefore, Event 3 is the most relevant sub-event that establishes the causal link between solar storms and their effects on modern technology and services.",

    "model_answer": "answer: Unable to answer\n\nThe provided audio does not contain any information about a \"POWER\" switch or a need to shut down global electricity. The audio content is focused on the sun sending a solar storm towards the earth, which is not directly related to the question asked. Therefore, it's impossible to determine which prior sub-events most strongly justify proposing such a shutdown scenario based on the given information.",

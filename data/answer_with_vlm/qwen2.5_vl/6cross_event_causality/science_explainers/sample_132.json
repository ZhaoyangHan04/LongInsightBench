    "model_answer": "answer: A, B\n\nThe narrator in Event 7 mentions that experts agree on underground geological disposal as the best option for high-level waste and spent nuclear fuel, which aligns with the visuals of a car driving through a dim, rough rock tunnel and the Geiger counter sounds. This suggests that the decision to select a location for an underground geological disposal facility was influenced by the recognition of the best disposal method for radioactive waste. \n\nEvent 5 emphasizes the hazards and longevity of radioactive waste from nuclear power generation, which would likely motivate countries to select a secure and long-term disposal method like underground geological disposal. The visuals of a large power facility and underwater handling/robotic operations in a controlled pool further support this idea, as they demonstrate the challenges associated with managing radioactive waste. Therefore, Events 7 and 5 are the most directly related to the site selection decisions for underground geological disposal facilities.",

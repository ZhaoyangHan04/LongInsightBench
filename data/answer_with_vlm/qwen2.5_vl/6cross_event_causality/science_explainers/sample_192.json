    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe question is asking about the context that led to the presenter asking why the media reported scientists predicting global cooling. Event 6 provides the necessary background by summarizing a literature review from the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, which found that there were fewer cooling papers compared to warming predictions. This directly sets up the question by contrasting the actual scientific consensus with the media's portrayal of scientists predicting global cooling.",

The audio seems to be a different context altogether, discussing a man in a black shirt speaking into a microphone. There's no mention of a speaker answering a question about waiting time or a potential age-reversal pill. Therefore, it's impossible to determine which earlier sub-events might explain the specific timeline offered in the question based on this audio.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe narrator's question about the delta-canard configuration being less popular than it should be is preceded by a series of events that build up to this point. Event 3 includes a visual cue of Mach 0.7-1.3, which likely refers to the efficiency of the delta-canard configuration. Events 4 and 5 provide detailed explanations of the lift/weight/center of lift and canard-wing geometry, as well as the features of the delta-canard configuration. These events set the stage for the narrator's question. Additionally, there is an opening running gag in event 0 where Europeans are described as being smarter, which primes the audience for the humorous response in event 7. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer.",

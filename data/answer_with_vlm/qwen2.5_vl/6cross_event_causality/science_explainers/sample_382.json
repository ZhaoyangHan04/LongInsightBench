    "model_answer": "answer: C: Event 6: “Clip 1” where the headphone-wearing speaker claims similarities in proteins don’t show relatedness and asserts human–ape protein differences, calling common ancestry “bogus.”\n\nThe narrator's corrective, data-driven presentation in event 8 is most likely a direct response to the claims made by the speaker in event 6. The speaker in event 6 challenges the notion that protein similarities indicate relatedness and argues against the idea of common ancestry, which the narrator aims to refute using data from Tables 4 and 5. Therefore, event 6 is the most relevant event leading up to the corrective presentation in event 8.",

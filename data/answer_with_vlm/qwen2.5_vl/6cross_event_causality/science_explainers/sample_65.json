    "model_answer": "answer: A, D\n\nThe narrator's statement about Trofim Lysenko being removed from his post and dying in obscurity suggests that there were significant changes in the political and scientific landscape that led to his downfall. Option A indicates that after Joseph Stalin's death, Lysenko's influence declined due to a loosening of state-backed suppression and the resurgence of scientific dissent. This aligns well with the idea that Lysenko's removal could be attributed to these factors. Option D mentions Lysenko's rejection of the gene/DNA framework and promotion of Lamarckian ideas, which would have likely contributed to his conflict with the scientific community and eventually led to his removal. Therefore, both A and D are plausible direct causes or primary contributing factors leading to Lysenko's outcome.",

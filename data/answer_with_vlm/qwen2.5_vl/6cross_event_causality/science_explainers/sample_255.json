    "model_answer": "answer: A, B, C\n\nThe narrator's warning in event 12 is most directly prompted by the earlier segments that discuss pseudoscience and its impact on modern medicine. Option A mentions Bill Maher's segment with denialist quotes, which aligns with the warning about pseudoscience. Option B refers to the tour of alternative health webpages, which is also related to pseudoscience and undermines modern medicine. Option C discusses the \"Natural Living\" slide and the persistence of quackery, which is another example of pseudoscience that the narrator is warning against. Option D, however, focuses on Pasteur's lab work and germ theory, which is not directly related to the warning about pseudoscience and fundamentalism undermining modern medicine.",

In Event 2 sub-event, the presenter clarifies the direction of Earth's rotation, which further supports the understanding of the Sun's apparent motion across the sky. Events C and D do not directly relate to the east-to-west appearance of the Sun.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A, B, C\n\nThe presenter first distinguished between revolution and rotation in Event 6, which would have clarified that revolution is not just spinning. In Event 7, the presenter defined revolution as the movement of Earth in its orbit around the Sun, showing the planetary orbits. This would have helped the presenter understand the direction of revolution. Finally, in Event 8, the presenter filled in the period of revolution and highlighted Earth's orbit in red, which would have reinforced the understanding of the direction of revolution. Therefore, these three events most directly led the presenter to conclude and make the update about the direction of Earth's revolution as \"Counter Clockwise.\"",

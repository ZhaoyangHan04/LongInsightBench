    "model_answer": "answer: A, B, D\n\nExplanation:\n- **Event 8** mentions James King warning about the museum bone being coated in shellac, which contains carbon. This directly relates to the contamination issue that could lead to a date for the preservative instead of the fossil.\n- **Event 5** explains that mineralized fossils lack original carbon/collagen, making them prone to contamination from other sources like shellac, which aligns with the concern raised in Event 8.\n- **Event 7** indicates that the sample was covertly taken from a museum without disclosing the intention to carbon date it, which could lead to the sample being handled in a way that introduced contaminants, thus affecting the results.\n\nEvent 3 does not directly relate to the outcome described in the question as it discusses a different topic (snails and a 1300-year-old seal) and does not mention shellac or contamination issues. Therefore, it is not the most direct cause of the outcome mentioned in the question.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A, B, C\n\nThe speaker's conclusion about carbon dating being more suitable for some carbon sources (e.g., plants) than for marine organisms is directly supported by the information presented in Events 3, 1, and 2. \n\nEvent 3 discusses the seal/snail anecdotes and sources warning about the inaccuracy of carbon dating for marine organisms due to the reservoir effect. This directly supports the conclusion that carbon dating may not be as accurate for marine organisms compared to other carbon sources.\n\nEvent 1 provides a detailed slide sequence on \"fictitious results with mollusk shells,\" explaining how inactive carbon from humus via the food web can yield anomalous radiocarbon ages. This further supports the idea that carbon dating may not be as accurate for marine organisms.\n\nEvent 2 explains that carbon filtering and dissolution in plants and rocks can reduce Carbon-14 content, producing misleading radiocarbon readings under certain conditions. This supports the conclusion that carbon dating may be more suitable for some carbon sources (e.g., plants) than for marine organisms.\n\nEvent 0, which mentions the 1949 blind tests on samples of known age confirming that carbon dating works and is widely used, does not directly lead to the conclusion about the suitability of carbon",

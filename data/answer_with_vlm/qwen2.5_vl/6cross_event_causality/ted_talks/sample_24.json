Option A sets up this conclusion by emphasizing the importance of accommodations and building systems to help students succeed. Option B highlights the diversity of learning differences, which supports the idea that they should not be viewed as inferior. Option C provides a positive example of how a supportive environment can help a student thrive despite their learning differences. Option D, however, focuses on negative labels and does not directly lead to the conclusion about learning differences being not bad.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A, B, and C.\n\nEvent 6 presents a structured and practical case by listing three steps (heighten awareness, identify trends, discover opportunities) and linking them to real-world examples like police training, Henry Ford's policy, and Mercedes' boxfish-inspired efficiency. This builds a case for the importance of observation in various fields.\n\nEvent 7 continues the structured case by adding two more steps (spark innovation, enhance skillset) and providing visual examples such as a UPS truck, a business card/order form, and a mind map. The speaker also explains how UPS routing and the improved cake-quote process are related to observation.\n\nEvent 8 demonstrates practical observation methods through visuals like a handwritten mind map, a recording app interface, a grid of collected images, and texture boards. The audio advises taking mind-map notes, recording, photographing, and collecting references, which further supports the idea that observation leads to better creativity.\n\nEvent 2, however, does not directly build the structured and practical case for observation leading to better creativity. It only provides a brief description of a painting and its elements without connecting it to the broader concept of observation and creativity. Therefore, it is not the most direct preceding event that builds the structured and practical case.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 11: The speaker rejects IRC as “confusing and clunky,” and becomes an early, strong advocate for CC’s open Slack because of its accessibility (visual: slide with “traitor*”; audio: her rationale and timeline).\n\nReasoning: The audio mentions that the speaker was called a \"traitor\" after celebrating a more accessible tool, which aligns with the speaker's advocacy for CC's open Slack over IRC due to its accessibility. This suggests that the backlash occurred because the speaker's actions were seen as challenging the status quo or disrupting established norms, which could be interpreted as a form of \"traitorous\" behavior. Therefore, the earlier moment that sets up or triggers this backlash is when the speaker becomes an advocate for CC's open Slack, which is perceived as a more accessible alternative to IRC.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 7: The “Masters of Open Source” slide with a male voice naming Stallman and Torvalds and noting FOSS grew beyond software.\n\nReasoning: The pivot in the speaker's argument occurs when they conclude that the culture of \"toxic norms\" and \"master/slave terminology\" is something that the \"masters\" have built. This conclusion is directly preceded by the mention of Stallman and Torvalds as the \"masters\" of open source, which sets up the idea that these individuals and their ideologies have shaped the culture. Therefore, the slide from Event 7, which introduces Stallman and Torvalds and frames them as the \"masters,\" is the most direct precursor to the critical pivot in the speaker's argument.",

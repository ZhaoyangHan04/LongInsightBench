    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 11. The speaker in Event 11 discusses how certain drugs/plants produce an interiorized tone that is molecularly real and can be influenced by other sounds, which aligns with the idea of sound acting on the body. The mention of visuals including chakras and symbolic diagrams further supports the experimental framing for sound acting on the body, which is consistent with the conclusion drawn in Event 12.",

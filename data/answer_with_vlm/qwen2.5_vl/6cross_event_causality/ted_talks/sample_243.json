The introduction of Āhau as a digital Pātaka and the on-stage acknowledgment of the builders (Ben and Sam) in Event 10 show that a product team and build environment are in place, which enables the presentation of Indigicoin. Additionally, the slide \"The benefits of this relationship\" in Event 11 lists Centrality and university partners, indicating institutional support for the broader platform underpinning future applications like Indigicoin. Therefore, these events directly enable the speaker to present Indigicoin as part of the future stack.",

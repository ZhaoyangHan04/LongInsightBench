    "model_answer": "answer: A, B, D\n\nThe speaker's viewpoint on the importance of community support and services like food stamps is likely influenced by personal experiences of poverty and financial struggles. Option A provides a context of growing up poor during the 2008 recession, which could have shaped her perspective on the need for community support. Option B describes a situation where the speaker lost their house to foreclosure and their mother became sick, highlighting the challenges faced by individuals in such situations and the importance of community support. Option D mentions the speaker's early political journey, including her support for Bernie Sanders and her consideration of voting for Jill Stein, which may have contributed to her understanding of the role of politicians and the importance of alternative political options. Option C seems unrelated to the speaker's viewpoint and does not provide any context that would lead to this perspective.",

The detailed explanation of MRNs in events 4-7, including the different types and their applications, would also be a plausible preceding event. The results table on the Sketchy Dataset in event 10 would provide concrete evidence of the performance rates and support the conclusion drawn in the final summary slide. The initial ImageNet slide and CNN architecture diagram in event 0, however, would not directly lead to the conclusion about MRNs.",

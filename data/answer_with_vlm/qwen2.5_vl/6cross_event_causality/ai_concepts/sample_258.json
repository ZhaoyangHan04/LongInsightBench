    "model_answer": "answer: A, B, C\n\nThe projected divergence in job outcomes between incumbents and fintechs in banking is most likely due to the following developments:\n\n- **Event 7:** This event discusses how AI and automation allow computers to perform tasks traditionally done by humans, leading to reduced staffing levels in banks. This directly contributes to the projected decrease in incumbents' jobs.\n\n- **Event 4:** This event highlights the downsizing of physical branches, such as UniCredit's reduction of 8,000 jobs and 500 branches, and a long-term decline in Bank of America branches. The transition to digital services and the need for retraining also play a role in reducing traditional banking jobs.\n\n- **Event 12:** This event describes banks financing and eventually acquiring fintech companies, which implies an increase in demand for fintech-related roles within the banking sector. This could lead to an increase in fintech jobs.\n\nEvent D does not directly contribute to the projected divergence in job outcomes between incumbents and fintechs, as it focuses on Goldman Sachs' underperformance due to regulatory changes and technology advancements, rather than the specific impact on job numbers in the banking industry.",

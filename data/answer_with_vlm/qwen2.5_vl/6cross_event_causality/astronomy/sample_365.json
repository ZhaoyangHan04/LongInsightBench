    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 5. In Event 5, the narrator describes Mars's \"subtle breezes\" and \"intense dust storms,\" which foreshadow the volatile weather conditions that lead to the storm in Event 6. The visuals accompanying this description show hazy, windswept terrain at sunset and a blue-tinted night scene, further emphasizing the presence of dust storms and the potential for severe weather. This sets up the environment necessary for the storm described in Event 6.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Event 4. The visuals of advanced stations, cranes, and rovers on a Martian-like landscape in Event 4 establish the research infrastructure needed for the subsequent report on plant growth in Mars-like soils. This provides the necessary exploration infrastructure, environmental understanding, and hazard knowledge required for the special report and the visuals of the futuristic Martian habitat with solar panels and rovers. Events 5 and 6 focus on atmospheric conditions and hazards but do not directly contribute to the exploration infrastructure or the report's content. Event 1 is too abstract and does not provide the practical conditions needed for the report and visuals.",

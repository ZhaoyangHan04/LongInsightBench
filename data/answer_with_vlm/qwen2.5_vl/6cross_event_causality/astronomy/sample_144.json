    "model_answer": "answer: D: Event 6: The identification of a “really good sunspot group” and mention of a couple of groups, establishing where sunspots are present on the disk.\n\nReasoning: The narrator mentions identifying a \"really good sunspot group\" and mentioning a couple of groups, which establishes the presence of sunspots on the disk. This is crucial for understanding where the sunspots are located, which is necessary for linking them with the bright loops (active regions). Therefore, Event 6 is the most relevant sub-event that directly enabled the identification and linkage of the active region \"AR 12573\" with the sunspot locations.",

Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine which earlier sub-event most directly sets up the ability to tell coronal holes and sunspots apart.",

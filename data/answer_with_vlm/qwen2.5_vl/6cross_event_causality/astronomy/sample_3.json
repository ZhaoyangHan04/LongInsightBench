    "model_answer": "answer: A, B, C\n\nThe emphatic warning about never using eyepiece solar filters is most directly led by the following points:\n\n- **Event 4**: This event explains that photochemical retinopathy is the most likely eye injury, often caused by failure or improper use of a solar filter. This directly addresses the risks associated with using eyepiece solar filters, which aligns with the warning in the video.\n\n- **Event 10**: This event provides specific guidance on using only materials designed for solar observation and checking filters regularly. It emphasizes the importance of proper filter usage, which is crucial for safe solar observing and supports the warning against using eyepiece solar filters.\n\n- **Event 11**: This event instructs that the solar filter should be placed over the large end of the telescope, not at the eyepiece end. This ensures that the filter is correctly positioned to protect the observer's eyes from harmful solar radiation, which is in line with the warning against using eyepiece solar filters.\n\nEvent D does not directly lead to the warning about eyepiece solar filters as it focuses on the hazard of looking into the eyepiece during projector setup, which is unrelated to the topic of solar observing.",

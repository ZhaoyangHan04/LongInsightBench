This context suggests that the location near Tromsø was chosen to facilitate signal reception from the Tromsø antenna.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 8 (audio+visual): Adoption of an off-the-shelf LOFAR-based receiver (CHiRA) with very wide bandwidth (~20–250/300 MHz, except FM), expanding what signals can be received.\n\nThis option directly relates to the capability of receiving radio waves from various atmospheric radar systems across different locations. The wide bandwidth of the CHiRA receiver enables it to capture a broad range of frequencies, which is essential for receiving signals from multiple sites like Tromsø, Andøya, and Kiruna. The other options do not directly address the multi-site reception aspect but rather focus on different aspects of the system's functionality.",

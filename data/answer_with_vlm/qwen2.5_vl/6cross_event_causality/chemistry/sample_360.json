    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 2: The hand annotates the graph with “Downhill = exo” and “uphill = endo,” while the speaker explains how to compare reactant and product energies to determine reaction type.\n\nThis event directly leads to the conclusion about endothermic and exothermic reactions because it introduces the concept of comparing reactant and product energies to determine whether a reaction is exothermic or endothermic. The other events either provide additional details or conclude the lesson but do not directly lead to the conclusion about ΔH being positive for endothermic reactions and negative for exothermic reactions.",

Therefore, there is insufficient context to determine which prior sub-events most directly enabled the 30 kJ release conclusion.",

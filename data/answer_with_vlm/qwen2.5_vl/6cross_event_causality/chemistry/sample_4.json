    "model_answer": "answer: B\n\nThe cloudiness in the limewater is directly caused by the bubbling of gas from the fizzing reaction after adding sodium carbonate to the acid. This is mentioned in Event 3, where the speaker notes the limewater turning cloudy due to the bubbling. Therefore, Event 3 is the most direct cause of the cloudiness observed in the test tube of limewater.",

The video only shows a bottle of Sodium Chloride Crystal and a beaker, but it does not describe the process of dissolving the salt, depositing it on a substrate, or drying it. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine which step(s) would cause the crystal growth outcome described in the question.",

The video only shows a container labeled as Sodium Chloride Crystal and a beaker, but it does not depict the process of preparing samples for XRD analysis. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine which preparation steps were used to acquire the diffraction patterns.",

The audio only contains the boy speaking, but there is no mention of the whiteboard title being updated or the audio defining diastereomers. Therefore, it's impossible to determine which earlier segments most directly set up and caused this transition based on the given information.",

The audio seems to be a continuous speech without clear transitions or summaries. Therefore, it's impossible to determine which prior segments most directly enable this final summary based on the given information.",

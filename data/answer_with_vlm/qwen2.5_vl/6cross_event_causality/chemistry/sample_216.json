    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A, B, and C.\n\nExplanation:\n\nEvent 6 provides the mole ratios from the balanced equation and explains how to convert between moles of reactants and products, which is essential for solving stoichiometric problems. Event 7 emphasizes using a balanced equation to get permanent mole ratios, identifying knowns/unknowns, and setting up a proportion, which are key steps in solving stoichiometric equations. Event 9 presents the specific problem involving nitrogen gas and its mole ratio, which is necessary for applying the mole ratios learned in Event 6 and the stoichiometric principles explained in Event 7. Therefore, these three events directly enable the calculation and presentation of the solution as 0.8 moles of NH3. Event 3, on the other hand, introduces a cooking analogy but does not directly contribute to solving the stoichiometric problem at hand.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A, B, and C.\n\nExplanation:\n\n- **Event 12** focuses on the specific relationship between H2 and NH3, setting up the proportion based on the mole ratio from the balanced chemical equation (N2 + 3H2 â†” 2NH3). This is crucial as it establishes the direct relationship needed for the calculation in event 13.\n  \n- **Event 6** provides the foundational knowledge about mole ratios and how to convert between reactants and products, which is essential for understanding the stoichiometric relationships involved in the calculation.\n\n- **Event 8** outlines the steps necessary to solve stoichiometric equations, including identifying knowns and unknowns and setting up proportions. This slide directly supports the proportional setup seen in event 13.\n\nEvent 14, while providing a worked example, does not directly lead to the proportional setup in event 13; rather, it is a subsequent step in solving the problem. Therefore, it is not the correct answer.",

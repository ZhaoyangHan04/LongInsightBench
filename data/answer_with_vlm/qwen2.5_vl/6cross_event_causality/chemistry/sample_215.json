    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 9. \n\nIn Event 9, the narrator explains that endothermic reactions are non-spontaneous at room temperature but become spontaneous at higher temperatures. This sets up the idea that the CaCO3 decomposition reaction, which is endothermic, would not occur at standard temperature and pressure (STP). The CaCO3 decomposition reaction is introduced with a positive Î”H, which aligns with the concept of endothermic reactions being non-spontaneous at room temperature. Therefore, the information from Event 9 directly supports the conclusion drawn about the reaction not occurring at STP.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe audio mentions that spontaneous reactions occur without an outside stimulus, which supports the idea that spontaneous processes are those that happen naturally. The reference to rusted iron nails further illustrates this concept by showing a spontaneous reaction (rusting) and its non-spontaneous reverse (unrusting). This aligns with option A, where the narration and slide state that when a spontaneous reaction occurs, the reverse is non-spontaneous, with a reference to rusted iron nails.",

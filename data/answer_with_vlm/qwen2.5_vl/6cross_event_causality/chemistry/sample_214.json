    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe question asks about the preparation steps that enabled the correct collection of water in the Dean-Stark trap during reflux with water separation. Option A describes the necessary steps to exclude moisture from the apparatus and prevent volatile condensate from reaching the inert-gas balloon during heating. This is directly related to the question as it mentions packing and attaching a drying tube with anhydrous calcium sulfate/calcium chloride and glass wool, heat-drying the setup, and assembling the reflux apparatus to keep external moisture out. The other options do not address the specific issue of moisture exclusion and condensate prevention.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Event 6: Connecting the three-way stopcock to an inert-gas cylinder, inflating the balloon, inserting the stopcock into the flask, purging with vacuum, and backfilling with inert gas.\n\nThis step directly enables the balloon-based inert-atmosphere heating setup by providing the necessary equipment (three-way stopcock) and procedure to connect the balloon to the reaction flask, inflate it with inert gas, and ensure that the system is free from noxious gases. This is a crucial step before implementing the balloon-based inert-atmosphere heating setup in Event 7.",

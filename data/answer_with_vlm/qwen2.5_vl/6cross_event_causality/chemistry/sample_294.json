    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 2’s explanation of fluorescence with energy-level visuals, Event 3’s two-photon/longer-wavelength rationale making these chromophores attractive labels, and Event 8’s successful synthesis/deprotection sequence yielding resveratrone and iso-resveratrone for measurement.\n\nExplanation: The comparative fluorescence graph for resveratrone versus iso-resveratrone requires a clear understanding of how these compounds interact with light at different wavelengths. Event 2 provides the foundational knowledge about fluorescence and energy levels, which is essential for interpreting the graph. Event 3 discusses the two-photon/longer-wavelength properties of these chromophores, which makes them suitable for such comparisons. Finally, Event 8's successful synthesis and deprotection of both resveratrone and iso-resveratrone enable the actual measurement and comparison of their fluorescence properties. Events B, C, and D do not directly contribute to the preparation of the compounds for fluorescence comparison as they focus on other aspects of the research process.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 9’s decision (audio) to pivot to an iso-resveratrol derivative for click labeling due to stability, Event 10’s stepwise construction of a click-ready derivative (visuals and audio: protections, substitutions, epoxidation, and olefination), and early Event 11 troubleshooting (audio: low-yield click with phenylacetylene and partial desilylation) that informed the protocol prior to global deprotection.\n\nThis answer is based on the information provided in the audio and visuals. The speaker mentions pivoting to an iso-resveratrol derivative for click labeling due to stability (Event 9), which is a key decision leading to the successful outcome. The stepwise construction of a click-ready derivative (Event 10) involves protections, substitutions, epoxidation, and olefination, all of which are crucial synthetic steps. Additionally, the troubleshooting during Event 11 (audio: low-yield click with phenylacetylene and partial desilylation) helped inform the protocol before global deprotection, which ultimately led to the successful outcome mentioned in the question.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A, B, C\n\nThe instructor's assertion about the necessity of a normal force for a friction force is supported by the following events:\n\n- Event 2: The instructor states that f_max equals a constant times N (coefficient of static friction) and clarifies when f = μ N applies, introducing the dependence of the friction limit on N. This directly supports the necessity of a normal force for a friction force.\n\n- Event 6: The friction-angle derivation is written and pointed to (tan φ = F_max/N = μ_s), explicitly relating F_max to N on the board and in speech. This further reinforces the relationship between F_max and N, justifying the necessity of a normal force for a friction force.\n\n- Event 9: In the two-block discussion, the instructor emphasizes relative motion and equal-and-opposite friction forces between blocks, also referencing the normal force, grounding the two-body context for event 10’s claim. This provides additional context and justification for the necessity of a normal force for a friction force, as it shows how the concept applies to real-world scenarios involving multiple objects.\n\nEvent 7 does not support the necessity of a normal force for a friction force, as it discusses a case where F can be zero and tan",

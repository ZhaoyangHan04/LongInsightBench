    "model_answer": "answer: A: The Dynamic Weight slide that explicitly shows “Rising & Speeding Up: Gain Weight” labeled as against gravity, guiding the up-fast push that makes the force spike (event 4).\n\nThe reasoning behind this answer is that the slide mentioned in option A provides a direct connection between the action of rising and speeding up and the gain in weight, which is consistent with the presenter's statement during the demo. This slide likely served as a visual cue for the presenter to perform the specific action that resulted in the weight spike.",

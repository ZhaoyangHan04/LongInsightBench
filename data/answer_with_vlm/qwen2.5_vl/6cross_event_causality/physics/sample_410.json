    "model_answer": "answer: A, B, C\n\nEvent 2 establishes the concept of a solenoid and the importance of the number of turns, which is crucial for the uniformity of the magnetic field. Event 5 provides visual evidence of the strong, uniform field produced by tightly spaced loops, which supports the claim about the solenoid's magnetic field. Event 3 introduces the equation B = μ0 n I and connects it to the idea of current loops producing magnetic fields, which is essential for understanding the solenoid's magnetic field behavior. Event 9, although not directly related to the causal basis of the uniform magnetic field, provides context for the significance of the solenoid in discussions of induction.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A, B, C\n\nThe speaker in the audio discusses the concept of \"little n\" (turns per unit length) and its connection to controlling the magnetic field in solenoids. This concept is introduced in Event 6 where the formula B_inside = (μ0 N I)/L = μ0 n I is shown, explaining that each loop contributes to the field and that the field can be controlled via parameters like the number of turns and length. Event 7 also reinforces this idea by repeating the formula B_inside = (μ0 N/L) I = μ0 n I and linking field strength to solenoid dimensions, noting that it weakens if length increases or turns are reduced, thus emphasizing the N/L dependence. Event 2 provides the practical context for defining a turns-per-length quantity that manufacturers can specify and users can 'cut to length,' which is relevant to understanding the concept of \"little n.\" Therefore, Events 6, 7, and 2 are the ones that most directly led to the formalization of the use of \"little n\" and its connection to controlling the field.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A, B, C, and D.\n\nThe speaker first establishes the X and Y axes in Event 3, which allows them to project the weight of the truck onto these axes. This projection results in the components mgcosθ and mgsinθ. In Event 4, the speaker relates the incline angle to the geometry by extending lines and determining which sides are adjacent and opposite, which helps in identifying the correct trigonometric functions to use for the components. In Event 2, the speaker introduces the three forces acting on the truck and adds their vectors to the diagram, which is necessary for understanding the forces involved. Finally, in Event 7, the speaker replaces the bumper and normal forces with string tensions using pulleys and weights, which is a step towards simplifying the problem and making it easier to analyze the forces involved.",

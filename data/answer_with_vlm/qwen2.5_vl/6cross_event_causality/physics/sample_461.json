    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe audio mentions that the discrete-jump result is linked to hydrogen's spectral lines, which implies a connection to quantum mechanics. The correct sequence of events leading up to this result would be:\n\nEvent 6: Recognition that the planetary picture fails (electrons cannot stand still).\nEvent 7: Explanation that accelerating charges radiate and would spiral inward unless special orbits exist.\nEvent 8: Demonstration that only whole-number-wavelength standing-wave orbits are stable.\n\nThese events collectively explain the concept of quantized energy levels in atoms, which leads to the discrete emission of photons when electrons transition between energy levels, resulting in the observed spectral lines. Therefore, option A is the most direct sequence of explanations that justifies the discrete-jump result.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 7’s stated flaw of the planetary model (accelerating electrons radiate), Event 8’s Bohr/de Broglie whole-number-wavelength standing-wave orbits (constructive vs. destructive interference), and Event 9’s visual/audio presentation of discrete energy levels and spectral validation.\n\nThe audio mentions that the presentation in Event 9 visualized discrete energy levels and spectral validation, which aligns with the concept of Bohr's model and de Broglie's wave-particle duality. The previous events, such as the flaw in the planetary model and the visualization of standing waves, set the stage for understanding the stability and discrete nature of electron orbitals, which eventually led to the visualization of electron orbitals through field-emission electron microscopy.",

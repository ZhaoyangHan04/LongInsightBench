    "model_answer": "answer: C: Event 10 (earlier sub-event): The soft putty is pressed into molds and then taken off to cure, transforming it into a solid before impact testing.\n\nThe outcome described in the question is the result of the process outlined in Event 10. The soft putty is first pressed into molds and then cured, which transforms it into a solid material. This solid material is then subjected to impact testing, where it is described as a dense, bouncy solid that rebounds on impact and slowly returns to its original shape. Therefore, Event 10 is the most direct sub-event leading to the target result.",

    "model_answer": "answer: C, A\n\nExplanation: The question asks about the reason behind the white cylinder's slow recovery after being pressed. Event C explains that the material is stiff and resilient when things happen quickly, which would resist quick deformation. Event A provides evidence of the material's time-dependent response, as shown by the durometer measurement, which indicates that the material becomes softer the longer it is held, suggesting gradual recovery over time. Events B and D do not directly address the slow recovery process described in the question.",

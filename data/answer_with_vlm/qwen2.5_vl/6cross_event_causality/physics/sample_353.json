    "model_answer": "answer: A, B, C\n\nThe video starts with Event 4 where the narrator introduces Ludwig Boltzmann and statistical mechanics, which is a crucial step towards understanding the Boltzmann distribution. Event 5 follows with a simulation of \"boxes and balls\" to motivate the concept of emergent distributions, which is essential for grasping the Boltzmann distribution. Event 6 then provides the histograms of \"balls per box,\" which the narrator states can be solved with pencil and paper, leading to the red curve. This process sets up the mathematical result of the Boltzmann distribution and <E> = kT. Event 1, however, is unrelated to the mathematical result and does not contribute to its introduction.",

Therefore, it's impossible to determine which prior sub-events most plausibly served as the primary contributing steps that establish the reference clock.",

This establishes the need for change and a new approach.\n\nEvent 7 follows with an audio discussion about gravity, time synchronization rates, Newtonian forces, and quantum potentials. The visuals include equations, network-like backgrounds, and gravitational expressions, which build upon the idea of interconnectedness and networks, hinting at the potential for a connected human network.\n\nEvent 9 further develops this theme by emphasizing concepts like entanglement, the first pulsing cubit, evolution, shared code, and a connected universe. The visuals, including a rainbow sphere surrounded by a DNA helix, an atom, and a heart, symbolize interconnectedness and the potential for a unified understanding of the universe.\n\nWhile Event 4 provides technical exposition on the evolution of the universe and particle structures, it does not directly address the need for a connected human network or the physics-inspired rationale for such a network. Therefore, it is not the most direct sub-event setting up the advocacy for Effective Altruism and collaboration towards safe quantum energy distribution.",

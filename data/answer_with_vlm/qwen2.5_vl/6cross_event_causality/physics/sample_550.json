    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Events 13 → 14 → 15: Explaining fusion in stars and binding dependence, showing the binding-energy-per-nucleon graph where energy gains diminish for heavier nuclei, and concluding that beyond a point fusion yields zero/negative energy so energy can be released by splitting large nuclei.\n\nThe audio discusses the concept of nuclear fission and how it releases energy by breaking apart heavy nuclei. The explanation provided in option B aligns with this topic as it explains the process of fusion in stars and the binding energy per nucleon graph, which leads to the conclusion that energy can be released by splitting large nuclei. This understanding is necessary before the host can introduce the concept of nuclear fission and show images of \"Fat Man\" and \"Little Boy.\"",

    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe host is explaining the concept of mass-energy equivalence using Einstein's equation E=mc², which directly relates mass and energy. The prior events introduce this concept, detailing how small amounts of mass can be converted into vast amounts of energy, and demonstrate the nuclear mass defect through a balance showing a nucleus versus separated nucleons. This aligns with the result sub-event in event 7 where the host mentions that mass is converted into energy. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.",

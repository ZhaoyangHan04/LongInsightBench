This aligns with Event 10 where the instructor explicitly does these substitutions and manipulations.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe boxed detachment speed is defined in Event 6 where the instructor explains the condition for losing contact as N=0 and states that mg cosÎ¸ must be balanced by the magnetic force qB u, explicitly calling u the speed at which contact is lost. This directly enables obtaining the boxed detachment speed during Stage 1.",

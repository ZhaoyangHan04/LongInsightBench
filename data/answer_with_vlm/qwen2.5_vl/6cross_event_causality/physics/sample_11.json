This process logically leads to the conclusion that both sine and cosine forms are valid for representing SHM. Therefore, option A is the correct choice.",

The audio starts with a title card and then introduces Dr. Jangam Sasidhar, Assistant Professor, but it does not include the specific content described in the question. Therefore, there is no basis to select any of the given options.",

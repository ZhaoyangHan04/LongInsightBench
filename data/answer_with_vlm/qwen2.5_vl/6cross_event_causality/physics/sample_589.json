    "model_answer": "answer: C: Event 5 — The speaker says he will integrate both sides about a point over a very small interval and the board shows δ(x − x′) under the heading “Algorithm for finding G(x, x')”.\n\nThe integration step in event 6 is directly prompted by the speaker's mention in event 5 that he will integrate both sides about a point over a very small interval. This aligns with the need to find the Green's function G(x, x'), which involves integrating the forcing function f(x') over a small interval around x'. The presence of the delta function δ(x - x') on the board in event 5 further supports this connection as it is often used in the context of integrating over a small interval to approximate the Green's function.",

The question requires specific details about the sequence of events leading up to the calculation, but the given frames do not provide this information.",

The audio mentions the scenario and that mass is the unknown, but it does not specify how the mass was calculated. The visuals show the specific heat value and the computed mass, but they do not provide details on the calculation process. Therefore, it's impossible to identify the exact events/sub-events that enabled the mass computation based on the given information.",

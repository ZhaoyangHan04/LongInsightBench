    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 3. \n\nEvent 3 discusses the magnetic flux of a dipole and parallels it with the electric dipole, showing that the magnetic field lines enter and leave the surface, which implies that the net magnetic flux through a closed surface is zero. This directly supports the boxed conclusion in event 9 about Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∮B·da = 0).\n\nAnswer: B",

    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe narrator in event 11 mentions the discovery of a magnetic monopole could change equations and make them more symmetrical. This speculation is based on the contrast between electric and magnetic Gauss's laws, which is established in event 10. In event 10, the narrator explicitly contrasts the electric and magnetic Gauss laws, highlighting the absence of magnetic monopoles through both on-screen graphics and narration. Therefore, event 10 directly sets up the speculation in event 11.",

    "model_answer": "answer: Unable to answer\n\nThe provided audio does not contain any information related to the theoretical rationale and experimental evidence that make the depiction of a photon splitting into an electron and a positron plausible. The audio only mentions the E=mcÂ² equation and the concept of pair production, but it does not provide any details about the theoretical rationale or experimental evidence behind it. Therefore, I cannot determine which earlier events provided the necessary information to make the depiction plausible.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Event 5. \n\nEvent 5 provides the necessary formulas and relationships between velocity, period, and radius, which are essential for calculating the tangential velocity and period of the rotating cylinder. The narrator reiterates these relationships, allowing for the conversion from radius and acceleration to velocity and then to period. This is crucial for obtaining the specific values mentioned in the question.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: Event 7. \n\nEvent 7 introduces the rotating cylinder habitat, which sets the context for the subsequent discussion about the ball being thrown inside it. This establishes the necessary framework for understanding the analogy between the rotating cylinder and a merry-go-round. Events 6 and 9 provide additional context and information, but they are not as directly tied to the specific analogy used in event 10. Event 2, while foundational, does not directly relate to the cylinder-and-merry-go-round analogy.",

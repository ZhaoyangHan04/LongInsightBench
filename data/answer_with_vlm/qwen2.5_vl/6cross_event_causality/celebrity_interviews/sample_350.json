    "model_answer": "answer: A, B, C\n\nThe audio in event 6 mentions Khloé's improved appearance and suggests that contouring, a possible nose job, and larger lips could have contributed to her polished look. This aligns with option A. Additionally, the audio in event 5 discusses weight loss and facial tweaks like micro-liposuction, Botox, and cheek fillers, which is consistent with option B. Lastly, event 8 provides gym training footage and narration about starting fitness during divorce, which supports the idea that weight loss and health improvements could have driven the visible transformation, making option C plausible as well. Option D does not seem relevant to the question since it addresses Khloé's response to scrutiny rather than the factors driving her improved appearance.",

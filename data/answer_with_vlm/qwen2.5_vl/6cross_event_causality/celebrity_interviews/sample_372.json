    "model_answer": "answer: B, C\n\nThe host in event 5 argues that Jackson's delivery, including his use of strong language and criticism of media, along with his on-stage behavior such as drinking, were key factors in sparking reactions. Event 1 directly supports this conclusion by showing Jackson on stage holding a bottle, using strong language, and criticizing media, which aligns with the host's argument. Event 3 also supports this conclusion by mocking the on-stage drinking and comparing it to a controversial moment involving Kanye West and Taylor Swift, further emphasizing the controversial nature of Jackson's delivery.",

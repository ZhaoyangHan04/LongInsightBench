    "model_answer": "answer: A, B, D\n\nExplanation: \n\n- Option A is relevant because it discusses the present-day variation of Uki Gatame and mentions the importance of combining pulling the sleeves and digging down at the knee/solar plexus, which could be seen as setting up the pressure-based execution.\n- Option B is relevant because it talks about the historical lineage of the knee on the solar plexus technique, which could be seen as a prior explanation for the pressure-based execution.\n- Option D is relevant because it mentions the 'neon belly' sensation (\"hovering or floating\") immediately before/during the Uki-gatame demo, which could be seen as a cue for a pressure-oriented application.\n- Option C is not relevant because it focuses on a different throw (Yoko-wakare) and does not mention any prior explanations or sub-events related to Uki-gatame.",

The frames show a group of people in a martial arts setting, but there is no indication of a competition or a demonstration of Yoko-wakare. Therefore, it's impossible to determine which prior explanations/demonstrations most directly caused or informed the execution of the side-blocking motion characteristic of Yoko-wakare.",

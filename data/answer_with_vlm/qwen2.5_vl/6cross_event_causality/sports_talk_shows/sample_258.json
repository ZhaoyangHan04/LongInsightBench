    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A, B, C, and D.\n\nThe on-screen text in event 7 mentions that target players decide on the best passing option and can pass to each other, which indicates a progression from previous instructions. The following events provided the necessary context and rules to enable this decision-making:\n\n- **Event 3** introduced the concept of 2v2 play with four target players, setting up the scenario where target players need to make decisions about passing.\n- **Event 4** provided specific instructions for Progression 2, allowing target players to pass to each other or back to the middle, emphasizing accuracy and support.\n- **Event 5** visually demonstrated how the ball could be passed between target players, and how middle players would react and support the pass.\n- **Event 6** clarified the rule that passing from one target player to another also scores a goal, reinforcing the importance of inter-target passing.\n\nAll these events together laid the groundwork for the decision-making and inter-target passing seen in event 7.",

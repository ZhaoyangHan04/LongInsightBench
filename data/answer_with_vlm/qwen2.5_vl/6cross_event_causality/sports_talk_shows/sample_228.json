    "model_answer": "answer: B, C\n\nThe events that most plausibly contributed to Kwame Brown's confidence decrease are Event 5 and Event 7. In Event 5, the narrator describes Jordan's training as incredibly tough and mentions that Jordan used offensive language, which could have negatively impacted Brown's confidence. Additionally, the visuals of tense coach-and-player scenes and No. 23 straining suggest that the training was physically and mentally challenging, which could have further eroded Brown's confidence. In Event 7, the narrator characterizes Jordan as too aggressive and says he insulted Brown daily with harsh slurs, which would have had a significant negative impact on Brown's self-esteem and confidence. The visuals of tense late-game moments and Brown walking off the court in a charged arena also support this interpretation. Therefore, Events 5 and 7 are the most plausible contributing factors to Brown's confidence collapse.",

    "model_answer": "answer: B\n\nThe narrator in Event 7 describes Jordan as being too aggressive and insulting Brown daily with harsh slurs, which creates a charged game environment with Brown under pressure. This aggressive behavior from Jordan would naturally lead to a humiliating dynamic when Brown makes mistakes, as mentioned in Event 8. Therefore, Event 7 provides the most direct explanation for the humiliating dynamic between Jordan and Brown.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A, B, C\n\nThe host mentions kicking off the 500K celebration boat tour and showing his setup, which includes the new HyperX headset and dual-monitor desk. This aligns with option A. In option B, the host describes upgrading to a new headset and is seen at a triple-monitor gaming station, which could be a part of the same setup being demonstrated. Option C also fits as the host talks about his setup and gestures towards the two monitors in the dim gaming room, which could include the dual-monitor desk and the new HyperX headset. Option D does not seem relevant as it mentions the kitchen area and shots, which are unrelated to the setup demonstration.",

The audio only mentions the narrator holding a 100 Lira bill and talking about its value. There is no mention of the supermarket or the bazaar, nor any comparison between the two locations. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine which earlier sub-events most directly explain why the supermarket shop was faster.",

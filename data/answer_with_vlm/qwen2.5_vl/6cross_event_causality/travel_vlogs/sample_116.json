    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Completing the flight and descending into the destination (visual wing views and approach; audio travel updates) (event 9).\n\nReasoning: The traveler has just completed their flight and is now descending into the destination. This aligns with the visual cues of the wing views and the audio travel updates indicating they are approaching their final destination. The subsequent events would logically follow as the traveler exits the terminal and is greeted outside before being seated in a car.",

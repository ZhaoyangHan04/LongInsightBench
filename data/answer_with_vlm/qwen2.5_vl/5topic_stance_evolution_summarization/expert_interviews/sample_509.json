    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: She begins by framing SETI as a search for technosignatures, using a biosignature analogy as shown by molecular graphics, then justifies the radio focus as cost-effective and transmissible while SKAO imagery appears. Next, she specifies narrowband, drifting signals with a frequency-chart visual, warns about human-made RFI that contaminates data, and reframes the goal as detecting RFI from space that repeats. She concludes that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, advocating repeated detections and coordination among multiple radio telescopes.\n\nThis answer is supported by the visual cues and spoken content in the video. The subtitles mention Dr. Ng's role as an astronomer at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in France, and the visuals include text about technosignatures, radio searches, and the need for confirmation criteria. The video also shows images of a telescope and frequency charts, which align with the spoken content about narrowband, drifting signals and the importance of repeated detections.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe audio and visuals suggest that Dr. Ng's stance progresses from her early-career enthusiasm for the multinational SKA to a broader view on how SETI should be pursued and funded. She starts by recalling her early-career experience with the SKA, calling it the best scientific instrument. The visuals support this with a globe animation emphasizing collaboration and a text card indicating about 14 years of work on the project. \n\nAs the conversation progresses, Dr. Ng moves into concrete leadership roles in 2022-2023 and shows construction progress, which is supported by the construction-site footage. She then broadens her perspective to discuss SETI's funding reality, mentioning private donors like Breakthrough Listen, which is visually represented by the Breakthrough Listen graphic. Finally, she addresses investment debates, conceding skepticism but arguing the public's deep interest and the need to keep searching despite a tiny searched fraction. This arc ties personal enthusiasm and institutional progress to pragmatic funding and a principled case for continued SETI.",

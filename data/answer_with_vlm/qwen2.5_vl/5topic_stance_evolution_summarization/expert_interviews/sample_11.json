    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe speaker's evolving viewpoint is clearly depicted through the interview visuals, hand gestures, and the persistent #YOUASK title. The speaker initially mentions a potential non-esports path and creative philosophy, which aligns with option A. He discusses his interest in music, playing various instruments, and even jokes about being a one-man band. He also mentions his experience in a choir and his preference for hands-on activities over abstract subjects. The speaker's final statement emphasizes the importance of creating art and the \"spark\" rather than being the best, which supports option A. Therefore, option A is the most accurate description of Puppey's viewpoint evolution.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe speaker's rationale and ethical framing of animal experimentation in the early segments of the video aligns closely with option A. The speaker mentions that his choice was not strategic but rather grew from his existing animal rights work and interactions with ex-industry individuals. He explains the concept of \"maximum tolerated dose\" both as a toxicity test and a metaphor for human and non-human breaking points. As the discussion progresses, he addresses the film's title and explains its significance, emphasizing that animals are not responsible for human diseases and that there are technological alternatives available. The speaker also acknowledges past progress and urges for non-harmful alternatives. Therefore, option A best captures the speaker's rationale and ethical framing of animal experimentation across the early segments of the video.",

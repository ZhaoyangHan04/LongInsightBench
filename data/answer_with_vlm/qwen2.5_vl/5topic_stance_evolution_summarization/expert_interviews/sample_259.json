    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe speaker, Hannah Meium, discusses her perspective on effective native advertising and audience trust. She begins by emphasizing the importance of blending the publisher's and brand's voices within the publisher's visual style. She cautions against forcing brand messages into the content without proper integration. To illustrate her point, she mentions a Netflix partnership that reshaped Mashable's visuals while clearly labeling it as partner content. Throughout the discussion, she stresses the need for transparency and upfront disclosure to maintain audience trust. The on-screen prompts introduce later sections that reiterate the importance of being upfront about the content's origin and purpose, reinforcing the idea that Mashable creates content rather than commercials. The final segment emphasizes the significance of transparency in preserving audience trust. Therefore, option A accurately reflects the development of Hannah's viewpoint across the segments.",

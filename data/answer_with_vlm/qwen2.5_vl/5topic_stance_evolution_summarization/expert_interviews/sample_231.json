Midway, he describes a \"mountain of work\" and cites major outlets like the New York Times, CNN, and USA Today engaging with the findings. He closes by stating the paper will appear in Neurology and be online later that day, followed by thanks, outro music, and a fade to black. This matches the description in option A.",

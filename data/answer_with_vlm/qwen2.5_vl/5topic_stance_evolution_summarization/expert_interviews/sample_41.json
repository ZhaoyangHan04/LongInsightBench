    "model_answer": "Answer: A\n\nThe speaker's viewpoint on financial ethics and her professional focus develops across the conversation in a way that aligns with option A. She starts by recalling how retirees lost their savings due to Enron, which prompts her to shift from confusion to a resolve to confront wrongdoing. She then explains how post-Enron rules made auditors raise fraud concerns and officers accept responsibility, before contrasting big firms' bottom-line focus with her own commitment to protecting individual clients. The studio's close-ups and her earnest gestures, alongside the on-screen CJ Nutter Accounting ID, underscore this client-first ethic. Therefore, option A is the best summary of Cynthia Nutter's viewpoint on financial ethics and her professional focus developing across the conversation.",

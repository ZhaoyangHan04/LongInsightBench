    "model_answer": "The answer is A. The interviewee starts by discussing the band's new lineup and their first full tour, mentioning a shaky start but growing confidence. He emphasizes that live performances are crucial, being selective about venues and eager for European crowds. He later states that touring is the most important aspect and that albums are secondary. Despite this, he confirms a label deal and an almost-written record due early next year, aiming for a simpler, raw live-minded sound. This aligns with option A, which describes the interviewee's evolving stance on live performance versus recording throughout the discussion.",

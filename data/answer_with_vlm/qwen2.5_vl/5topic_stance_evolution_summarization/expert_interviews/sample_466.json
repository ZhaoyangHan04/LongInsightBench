    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe speaker describes being inspired by a documentary about island-swimming elephants, while speaking before a large underwater elephant image. He then recounts bureaucratic hurdles and a corruption scandal that halts his permit, yet he re-ups his contract, scouts an island with contrasting depths, and carefully times the bathing ritual to shoot. After taking 36 frames, he achieves one perfect image during a brief swim, later standing beside the framed print in the gallery and reflecting on the shot’s two-year effort and ethereal significance. The visuals of the dim gallery and the elephant backdrop reinforce the story’s resolve and pride.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe speaker begins by introducing himself as a National Geographic photographer, standing before striking wildlife imagery, which sets the tone for his professional identity. He then shares his personal backstory, revealing that his parents have major scientific achievements and joking about the expectations placed upon him. This is followed by a recounting of his school struggles and a vocational discovery of photography, culminating in his father's cautious blessing to get a non-photo degree first. As a new dad speaking in the gallery beside the underwater elephant image and mingling with attendees, he reflects on choosing to \"celebrate what's right with the world,\" signaling a mature, positive artistic outlook. The visuals of the gallery and the elephant backdrop underscore his evolution from an uncertain student to a purposeful photographer and parent. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

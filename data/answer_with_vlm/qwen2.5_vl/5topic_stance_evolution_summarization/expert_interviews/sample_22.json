    "model_answer": "The answer is C: The story moves from speculation and ambiguity to Musk’s view that rapid AI advances exceeded the organization’s ability to ensure ethical deployment. It reframes the event from personal or procedural issues to systemic AI-safety concerns, ultimately presenting the departure as part of an urgent, community-wide challenge.\n\nThis option best captures the development of the narrative from the initial breaking news to the later analysis in the video. The video starts with the breaking news about the firing of Sam Altman, which is presented as a sudden and unexpected event. However, as the interview progresses, Elon Musk provides his perspective on the situation, highlighting the ethical and safety concerns associated with the rapid advancements in AI. He reframes the event from a personal or procedural issue to a systemic challenge related to AI safety and governance. This shift in perspective suggests that the firing was not just a result of personal or procedural issues but also a symptom of deeper challenges that demand careful safeguards. Therefore, option C accurately reflects the development of the narrative in the video.",

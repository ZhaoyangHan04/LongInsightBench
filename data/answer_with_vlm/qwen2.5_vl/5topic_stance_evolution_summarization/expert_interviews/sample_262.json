    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe speaker begins by recalling the 1970s programmer community that shared software and its later destruction, with Italian subtitles mirroring that message as he gestures in a cluttered office. He then rejects a proprietary life and carefully defines the core freedoms of free software while the translated captions reinforce each point. Next he states that in 1983 he announced a plan to build a free operating system, as later visuals spotlight GPL “superhero” icons and the term GNU/Linux. He finally expands to a global perspective, describing six-continent collaboration and local service-oriented business models that challenge megacorporations, highlighted by titles like “La Globalizzazione.” This narrative aligns with option A, where the speaker's personal history is developed into a broader movement and its global implications.",

    "model_answer": "answer: C\n\nThe interviewee's stance towards digital card games and acquisition models develops as follows:\n\n- Initially, she admits to having some hesitation towards card games but warms up to Hearthstone because of its online playability, appealing visuals, and simplicity.\n- She criticizes Gwent's artwork and mentions that Magic: The Gathering didn't interest her in its digital form, emphasizing that artwork matters to her.\n- When prompted about other digital card games, she expresses interest in Artifact due to its artwork and her Dota background, and appreciates a straightforward store model that allows her to get what she wants.\n\nThis development in her stance aligns with the on-screen prompt about other digital card games, where she shifts towards valuing artwork and straightforward acquisition. Therefore, option C best describes her evolving stance towards digital card games and acquisition models.",

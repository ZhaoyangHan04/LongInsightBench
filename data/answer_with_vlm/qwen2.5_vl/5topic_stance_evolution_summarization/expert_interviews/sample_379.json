    "model_answer": "The answer is A: The discussion opens with on-screen identification of Wayne Borg under Wamda branding as he outlines a mission to enable Arabic content and a regional hub. It then moves from identifying gaps in newer media to a built community of roughly 100 content-creating companies, before detailing training pipelines with global partners and a one-year animation academy, internships, and an incubator investing in eight startups. The close features a practical toolkit—a creative lab and an investment vehicle—framed by confident tones, hand gestures, and the formal table-and-microphone setting that underscores a journey from vision to concrete structures and outcomes. The consistent star-pattern backdrop and alternating close-ups reinforce the professional momentum of his case.\n\nThis option best captures the evolution of Wayne Borg's portrayal of twofour54's role across the interview segments. It shows a clear progression from the initial mission statement to the detailed description of the company's achievements and future plans. The visuals also support this narrative, with consistent branding and professional settings that emphasize the company's growth and success.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A. The speaker starts by contrasting free software with open source, calling open source a set of compromises to reassure companies, which is also reflected in the screen's framing of the comparison. He then pivots to discussing freedoms and participation as the real spark, and later the visual title shifts to “Free Software vs. proprietary software” as he asserts free software will win and is not merely “free beer.” He closes by applying this to education, saying the free software platform is richer and will prevail in schools.",

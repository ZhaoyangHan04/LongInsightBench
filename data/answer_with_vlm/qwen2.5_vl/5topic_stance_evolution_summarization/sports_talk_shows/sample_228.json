Initially, the title card and relationship setup present a bold visual accusation that Jordan ruined Brown. However, the video also frames their relationship as a big-brother/father-son dynamic, suggesting a close bond between them. This is followed by training anecdotes and on-screen quotes that reveal Brown's own pre-draft doubts and Jordan's harsh treatment. The video culminates in a return to the claim that Jordan ultimately ruined Brown, supported by Brown's reluctance and the commentary about daily humiliation. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

    "model_answer": "The video's stance about the WNBA's competitiveness develops from the opening studio soundbite through the subsequent game montages and commentary in a manner consistent with option A. The video starts with a bold claim that the WNBA is the most competitive league, immediately met by an audible challenge of “Stop the cap!” From there, the visuals pivot from a studio setting into intense All-Star and Finals game footage, while commentators highlight standout plays, statistics, and near-dunks to support the league's high level. Later, play-by-play celebrates skill, blocks, and “must-see” sequences, tying the action to its broader impact. It culminates with a player declaring, “I didn't come to play just to have fun. I want to win!” as scoreboards and crowd energy reinforce a relentless competitive tone. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

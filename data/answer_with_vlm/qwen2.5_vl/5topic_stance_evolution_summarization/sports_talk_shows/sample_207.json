The images show a group of individuals in a martial arts setting, but there is no indication of the audio content or the speaker's comments. Therefore, I am unable to provide a confident answer to the question.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: The topic is framed through a historical and technical comparison, with the speaker calling it a sacrificing throw and contrasting it to Sumi Gaeshi before promising to show Yokowakare. It then shifts to a labeled modern O-Yoko-Wakare demo with clear footwork and arm cues, followed by competition footage where he contrasts it with Yokogake. Finally, it is connected to Nage-no-kata and presented with variations and randori (even nogi) applicability, situating the throw within both kata and live practice.\n\nThis answer is based on the following observations:\n\n- The speaker begins by discussing the concept of a \"sacrificing throw,\" which is a term used in judo to describe a technique where the thrower risks their own balance to achieve a takedown.\n- The speaker then contrasts this concept with Sumi Gaeshi, another throwing technique.\n- The speaker promises to demonstrate Yokowakare, a specific throwing technique, and shows a labeled modern O-Yoko-Wakare demo with clear footwork and arm cues.\n- The speaker then shows competition footage where he contrasts Yokowakare with Yokogake, another throwing technique.\n- The speaker connects the throw to Nage-no-kata,",

    "model_answer": "Answer: C: He moves from excitement to analysis, using the bannered confirmation screens as a backdrop while he weighs the high price against United’s needs and rivals’ spending. By the later segments he endorses the deal as transformative and leadership-boosting, then closes on the red subscribe screen after the long-form talk in the bamboo setting.\n\nThe speaker begins by expressing excitement about Harry Maguire's signing, as indicated by the initial headline-style announcement and the visuals showing the confirmation of the deal. However, he then transitions into a more analytical tone, discussing the high price of the transfer and comparing it to other teams' spending. This shift in tone suggests that he is weighing the pros and cons of the signing. In the later segments, he seems to come to a conclusion that the signing is worth the price and that it will be a significant boost to Manchester United's defense. The video ends with a red subscribe screen, indicating that the speaker is encouraging viewers to follow his channel.",

The visuals show a man speaking in front of bamboo, but the audio content is not provided. Therefore, it is impossible to analyze the development of his perspective across the mid-video segments to the outro based on both visuals and audio.",

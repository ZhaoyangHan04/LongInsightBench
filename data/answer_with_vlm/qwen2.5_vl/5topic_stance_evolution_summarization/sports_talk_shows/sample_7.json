    "model_answer": "Answer: A\n\nThe presenter's stance and presentation escalate from the opening to the conclusion. In the beginning, he promises to prove the owners are extracting wealth, framed by #GLAZERSOUT branding and the video title asserting “PROOF” of thievery. He then brings in Swiss Ramble charts and external financing graphs to argue money is leaving via dividends and interest, comparing United unfavorably to rivals as his tone grows angrier. He culminates with an explicit activist appeal and profanity, paired with protest imagery including a banner accusing the owners of stealing over £1B. This escalation is evident through the presenter's increasing anger and the use of protest imagery, which aligns with option A.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: C: #GLAZERSOUT and MONEY/GREED/POWER overlays, plus tweets and graphs, visually frame a critique as his tone shifts from calm analysis of Ferguson-era success despite ownership to anger about debt and dividends. He contrasts that period with alleged underinvestment and rejects transfer fees as a deflection from larger extractions. He ends by imploring supporters to push back because the club operates like a business rather than a football club.\n\nThe presenter's argument is developed through the use of visual elements such as the #GLAZERSOUT and MONEY/GREED/POWER overlays, as well as tweets and graphs. These visuals help to frame the critique of the Glazers' ownership and their impact on Manchester United's financial situation. The presenter's tone shifts from a calm analysis of the club's success during the Ferguson era to anger about the debt and dividends imposed by the Glazers. He contrasts this period with the alleged underinvestment and rejects transfer fees as a deflection from larger extractions.

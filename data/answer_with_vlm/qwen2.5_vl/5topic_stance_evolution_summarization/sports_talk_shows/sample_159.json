    "model_answer": "Answer: C: The stance evolves from uncertainty about blind approaches to conviction that the snow is good and this is going to be on, accompanied by hard-driving music and footage of clean airs. Momentum builds with whoops and collective energy after the first drops, and by later segments speakers emphasize flow, fun, and community over rankings. Visuals reinforce this arc with close-up talkers who then go ride, group celebrations, and a spokesperson addressing the camera about what theyâ€™re building.\n\nReasoning: The video shows a progression in the riders' confidence and the atmosphere as they move through their runs. Initially, there's a sense of anticipation and preparation, followed by excitement and celebration as they ride. The commentary also reflects this, with speakers praising the conditions and the community aspect of the event. This aligns with option C, which describes a shift from uncertainty to conviction, followed by momentum and community focus.",

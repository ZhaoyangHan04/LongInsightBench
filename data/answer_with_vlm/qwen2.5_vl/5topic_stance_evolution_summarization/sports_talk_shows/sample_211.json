    "model_answer": "The answer is A: Early entries outline concrete reasons some stars likely won’t hold world titles again—Lashley’s erratic booking post–Vince, Balor’s injury and diminished chances, and Mahal’s enhancement role—despite visuals repeatedly showing their past title moments and countdown slates. Later, the tone shifts toward affirming legacy and relevance without new world titles, explicitly framing Rey Mysterio as important regardless of championships and noting Cena’s likely losses won’t diminish his legacy, with Kofi’s enduring popularity underscored. The list presentation and belt imagery highlight past glory while the narration pivots to value beyond future reigns.\n\nThis answer is based on the provided video content which shows the presenter discussing various wrestlers who may never win another world title. The presenter mentions specific wrestlers like Lashley, Balor, and Mahal and explains why they might not win another title. The visuals show the wrestlers' past achievements and the countdown graphics, but the commentary shifts towards affirming their legacy and relevance even if they don't win another title. The presenter also mentions Rey Mysterio, Cena, and Kofi as examples of wrestlers whose legacy isn't diminished by their potential loss of world titles.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: The commentary tempers expectations for world titles—first noting Styles’ plateau and then steering Sheamus toward an Intercontinental goal—while the visuals still showcase belts and celebratory shots. With Strowman, the narration recalls a surprising past reign and an uncertain future after release and return, before arriving at Kofi, whose legacy and popularity are emphasized over title prospects, highlighted by the countdown slate. The arc moves from pragmatic title expectations to valuing enduring stature.\n\nThe video starts with AJ Styles and Sheamus, where the commentary notes their current status and future prospects. It then shifts to Braun Strowman, where the commentary talks about his past achievements and current situation. Finally, it arrives at Kofi Kingston, where the commentary emphasizes his legacy and popularity rather than his title prospects. The visuals also support this trajectory, showing belts and celebratory shots for the first three wrestlers but focusing on Kofi's legacy and popularity. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe presenter begins by expressing excitement about transfers, then shifts focus to the preseason as a proving ground for Erik Ten Hag's system. He uses club-released clips of intense passing to argue that these are just the beginning. The presenter also incorporates Ten Hag's own words about training and automation, emphasizing the importance of repetition becoming second nature. He highlights both youth schooling in an Ajax pattern and improvement of the current squad. Visuals of a coach's stopwatch and De Gea's extra work further reinforce his points about standards and precision. Finally, he frames the situation as the start of a buy-in process to a defined system rather than a finished product. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

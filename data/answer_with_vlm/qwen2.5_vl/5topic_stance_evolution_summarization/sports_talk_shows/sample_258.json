    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: It begins with middle players combining to pass quickly to a free target to score. Progressions then allow target-to-target passes to count as a goal while middle players react and support, with target players choosing the best passing option. Finally, it becomes a competition to accumulate the most successful passes, with target and middle players rotating positions to keep play flowing.\n\nThis answer is based on the information provided in the audio, which describes the progression of the drill from a simple \"Find a Friend\" setup where middle players combine to pass to a free target, to allowing target-to-target passes to count as a goal, and finally evolving into a competitive stage where players rotate positions to maintain flow and accumulate successful passes. The other options do not accurately reflect the described evolution of the drill's scoring conditions and player roles.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: Early on, players are told to react, find space, and pass to a free target; this evolves into accurate passing, decision-making, and constant support as target-to-target options appear. Later, competition centers on most successful passes with rotations, and the Four Corners possession game adds cues like open body shape, good support angles/distances, and switching play to the far corner, reinforced by the narration.\n\nThis answer is supported by the audio which mentions that the early 2v2 sequences focus on reacting, finding space, and passing to a free target. As the session progresses, it shifts towards accurate passing, decision-making, and constant support as target-to-target options become available. The Four Corners possession game introduces new cues such as open body shape, good support angles, and switching play to the far corner, which are reinforced by the narration.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: An alarming claim is presented straight-faced with big on-screen text, but the stance evolves into cheeky skepticism: calls to show the data, doubts about historical measurement, and a tongue-in-cheek “I know baby dicks” from a female voice. The playful, prop-filled set and the host reading from papers emphasize it’s a comedic debate rather than a settled fact. They close by nitpicking measurement technique in millimeters and then change topics.\n\nThis answer is chosen because the video shows a man making a statement about penises shrinking, which is presented as an alarming claim. The on-screen text reinforces this claim. However, the hosts then call for data and question whether measurements exist over time, showing skepticism towards the claim. The playful set and props used by the hosts further indicate that this is a comedic debate rather than a serious discussion. The hosts also nitpick the measurement technique in millimeters, suggesting that they are taking the claim seriously but also poking fun at it. Finally, they change the topic, indicating that they have moved on from the discussion.",

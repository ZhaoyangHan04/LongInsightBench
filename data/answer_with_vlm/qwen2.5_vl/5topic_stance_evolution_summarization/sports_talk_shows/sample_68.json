    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: It starts by visually labeling the offense (offensive line, quarterback, running backs, receivers) while the narration explains each role and even concludes that section with “That’s offense.” The focus then shifts on-screen to defensive formations like 4-3 and 3-4 as the speaker explains linemen, linebackers, and defensive backs. Finally, the visuals and commentary move to special teams, showing kickers and listing specialist roles to wrap up the team’s third phase.\n\nThis answer is supported by the video content where the presenter first shows the offensive positions and explains them, then moves on to the defensive positions, and finally covers the special teams. The visual changes in the video also support this sequence.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: The stance progresses from a component-by-component offense breakdown (offensive line, QB, backs, receivers/TE) shown in fixed formations to a defense described and depicted as variable (4-3 vs. 3-4) and freer in movement. It concludes by spotlighting special teams specialists on screen and in voiceover, also noting lower-risk duties and that teams mix personnel but keep them to one or two roles. The overall tone moves from rigid assignments to controlled flexibility.\n\nThis answer is supported by the video content which shows the offense with a fixed formation and the defense with variable schemes. The special teams section is also shown with specialists, and the narrator mentions that players can switch roles but usually stick to one or two positions.",

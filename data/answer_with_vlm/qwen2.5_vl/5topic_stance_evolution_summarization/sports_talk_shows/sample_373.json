The studio discussion then rejects a wholesale return to ’90s bruising while affirming Curry’s skill set and acknowledging that postseason physicality still exists. The overall arc seeks balance between defense and skill rather than an extreme.\n\nThe speaker discusses the evolution of officiating and physicality in basketball, starting with the idea that officiating has \"legislated defense out,\" which means that the rules have made it harder for defenders to be physical. He then suggests that loosening the whistle and allowing for hand-checking could help bring back some of the physicality that was lost. The speaker also mentions that the late '90s were too physical and that smaller, skilled players could still thrive. He also notes that playoff physicality still ramps up. Throughout the video, the speaker stresses that Curry doesn't flop and calls for consistency in defending. The overall arc of the video seeks a balance between defense and skill rather than an extreme.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The show opens by framing a Betting 101 segment, then walks through spread bets before moving to moneyline, totals (over/under), straight (prop) bets, parlays, and finally teasers, concluding with a brief wrap-up. Visually, it alternates between a sweatered host in a stadium-style studio and a suited analyst against a cityscape while a left-side menu of bet types and a persistent promotional banner (with HURRY branding) guide the sequence.\n\nThis answer is supported by the audio content which mentions the different types of bets such as spread bets, moneyline bets, over/under bets, straight bets, parlays, and teasers. The visual elements also match this description, showing the host in a stadium-style studio and the analyst in a cityscape setting. The left-side menu of bet types and the persistent promotional banner with HURRY branding are also visible in the video frames provided.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is B: From foundational spread concepts, the conversation pivots into multi-leg structures that raise the upside and the riskâ€”first parlays (better odds if you hit all selections) and then teasers (moving lines while still needing everything to cash). The on-screen menu remains in view and the promotional banner persists as the presenters switch settings, signaling a deliberate progression from simpler to riskier plays.\n\nThis answer is based on the information provided in the video where the presenters discuss different types of bets starting with spread bets and moving towards more complex bets like parlays and teasers. The visuals include the bet-type menu and the HURRY banner which reinforces the stakes.",

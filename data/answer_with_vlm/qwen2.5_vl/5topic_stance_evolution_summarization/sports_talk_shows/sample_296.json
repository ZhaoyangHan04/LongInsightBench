    "model_answer": "The answer is A. The host starts off with a somber, candlelit set, welcoming viewers and teasing a discussion with Kenny Omega. He then pivots to faction warfare while handing the floor to other members. Later, he spotlights San Francisco conflicts, including the leadership fight and the Young Bucks' rematch, speaking more forcefully while lounging with a cigar. Finally, he declares main-event stakes and turns accusatory about \"distractions,\" the Golden Elite, and Kota Ibushi, punctuating it by extinguishing a candle, showing a broken photo, and ending on the G1 Special graphic. This evolution in his stance reflects the changing focus and stakes of the promo.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A\n\nThe audio mentions Hangman Page's remarks about stepping up and a July 7 tag with the Villain against Tanahashi and Kushida, which aligns with option A. The BC-4LIFE speaker's complaints about travel and issuing threats also match this option. The mention of San Francisco and the G1 Special graphic further supports this answer. Therefore, option A is the most accurate representation of the development of the hype for the G1 Special in San Francisco across the wrestler promos.",

The available clips show a news anchor reading out a statement from Imran Khan, but there is no direct dialogue from Imran Khan himself. Therefore, it's impossible to determine how his narrative develops over time based on these clips alone.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: B\n\nThe anchor's questions and Imran Khan's responses indicate a consistent stance throughout the segment. Initially, Imran Khan is asked if he will appear in court, and he responds affirmatively, stating that he has protective bail and that his lawyer assured his attendance. He disputes claims of evasion and frames any prior nonappearance as driven by security threats. The anchor then presses him on cooperation, and Imran Khan reiterates his commitment to appear within legal protections, including bail until the 18th and an assurance to police. The anchor's challenge about evasion sharpens his defense, and the broadcast underlines his impending appearance, visually keeping him in a formal backdrop with flags and a persistent ticker about the court's bar on arrest. Therefore, option B best describes the evolution of Imran Khan's stance across the segment.",

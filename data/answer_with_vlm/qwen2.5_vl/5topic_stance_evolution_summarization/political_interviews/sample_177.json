    "model_answer": "Answer: A: She is first introduced under a Green Party canopy as Angela Walkerâ€™s assistant, then recounts moving from a Bernie supporter to discovering Jill Stein through meme communities and connecting with the Green Party. She later identifies herself as running a Hawkins meme stash and working on the national campaign, finally pivoting to youth empowerment and a call-to-action that includes a Gretzky quote about taking shots. The steady visuals of the H2O Hawkins shirt, the Green Party Washington banner, and her increasingly animated gestures under the tent reinforce this progression.\n\nReasoning: The audio mentions Ashley's political journey and campaign role shifting from being a Bernie supporter to discovering Jill Stein through meme communities and connecting with the Green Party. It also mentions her involvement in the national campaign and her focus on youth empowerment. The visuals of the H2O Hawkins shirt, the Green Party Washington banner, and her increasingly animated gestures under the tent support this progression. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A\n\nThe audio suggests that Ashley Crabtree begins by sharing her personal experiences, including the challenges she faced during the 2008 recession and the impact it had on her family. She emphasizes the importance of community support and services, as politicians may not always be able to help. As she continues speaking, she broadens her message to empower youth and minority voices, and she concludes by providing practical steps for mobilizing others, such as signing petitions and having conversations with friends. The visuals show an outdoor campaign setting with a Green Party tent, banner, and her H2O Hawkins shirt, which frames her animated delivery. This arc moves from personal struggle to mobilizing others in the same outdoor campaign setting, making option A the most fitting choice.",

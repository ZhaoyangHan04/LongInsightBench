    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe speaker describes being blindfolded, handcuffed, and disoriented by a rough, circular van ride before the blindfold is removed in a room, all while calmly gesturing in a serene outdoor setting. He then explains harsh, windowless conditions with no bed and a hole as a toilet, before moving to scenes of being walked through colored-lit corridors into interrogation rooms and told to recount his life. Later, he says the process shifts into document-heavy debates and a coerced statement despite never being formally charged, only labeled a national security threat. This aligns with option A.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe speaker begins by describing his isolation, mentioning the lack of exercise and conversations with guards, and losing track of time. His on-screen demeanor is calm, and he gestures to emphasize his points. As the interview progresses, he adopts a more tactical stance during interrogations, leveraging his language skills and using stacks of documents to support his arguments. He questions the vagueness of the accusations and asks for clarification, contrasting \"we believe\" with \"reason to believe.\" Therefore, option A best describes the evolution of the speaker's stance from describing isolation to actively challenging the rationale behind his detention.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: It begins with a local, solutions-focused tone as the driver describes a community job fair in the car. The team then spotlights a small business—an award-noted barbecue spot—while encouraging civic participation and voting, before concluding at a formal town hall where the speaker, identified on-screen as Beto O’Rourke, delivers a serious policy case on gun safety with audience applause. This progression moves from community initiatives to small-business engagement to concrete policy advocacy.\n\nThis answer is supported by the video content which shows the driver describing a community job fair in the car, highlighting a small business (barbecue spot) during the restaurant stop, and concluding with a town hall where Beto O’Rourke discusses gun safety policy. The progression in the campaign's message aligns with option A.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: She starts as the local guide and driver in the car, identified by name and noted as unopposed, while discussing community priorities like a job fair. Later, at the town hall, she is publicly praised and framed as part of the community-led effort before the policy discussion begins, signaling her transition from host to highlighted community leader.\n\nThis option is correct because the video shows Candice Quarles driving and talking about community priorities such as a job fair, which indicates that she is actively involved in the community. Additionally, the text overlay identifies her as a DeSoto City Councilwoman, suggesting that she has a role in the community. At the town hall, she is publicly praised and framed as part of the community-led effort, indicating that her role has evolved from being a local guide and driver to being a highlighted community leader.",

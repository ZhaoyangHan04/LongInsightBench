    "model_answer": "The answer is C: The segments trace a shift from policy narrative to criminalization: a prompt about antimafia oversight and on-screen “di Lorenzo D’Agostino” lead into tactics of climbing from small to big “fishes.” This is followed by post-rescue questioning on ships and accusations of NGO collusion through a code of conduct, and finally a large trial accusing 21 people, countered by the speaker’s insistence on asylum rights. The consistent bookshelf backdrops, logos, and captioned prompts visually stitch this tightening legal frame together.\n\nThis option best captures the development of the legal-political framing of rescues across the later segments. The speaker mentions the antimafia directorate, which is then linked to anti-mafia methods being repurposed towards Libyan smuggling networks. Post-rescue questioning on ships and accusations of NGO collusion are also mentioned, leading up to a large trial accusing 21 people. The speaker's insistence on asylum rights is also noted, which contrasts with the criminalization narrative. The consistent visual elements like the bookshelf backdrop, logos, and captioned prompts further support the idea of a tightening legal frame.",

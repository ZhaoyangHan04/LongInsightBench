The first two clips show a static image with no audio, and the subsequent clips only capture a portion of the interview where the interviewee is speaking about the military's role in governance. There is no information about the interviewee's views on the judiciary, election commission, or any other aspects of governance beyond the military's role. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the evolution of his framing based on the given information.",

    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe interviewee's foreign policy posture and moral calculus regarding Afghanistan, the United States, and rights issues such as Kashmir are developed in a pragmatic manner. He first stresses pragmatic engagement with Kabul, avoiding a new war on terror and working jointly with whoever governs Afghanistan. He frames ties with Washington as interest-based, acknowledging the cypher episode but insisting Pakistan must move on and maintain good relations. He also emphasizes a Prime Minister's duty to avoid moral statements that harm his own people. Later, he highlights Kashmir within UN parameters while noting poorer countries' limited scope for moral posturing. Therefore, option A best describes the interviewee's evolving stance on these issues.",

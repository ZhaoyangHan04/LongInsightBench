    "model_answer": "The answer is A. The speaker begins by emphasizing FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) as a tool for addressing the pothole issue, challenging an official claim about pothole counts from a past case. He then describes how the NGO launched an open-source, WhatsApp-based chatbot promoted through newspapers and social media, allowing citizens to share geo-tagged photos. This resulted in a Bengaluru map filling with data points, and within three weeks, 5,400 reports were submitted and accepted by the High Court to hold BBMP accountable. The speaker also mentions the use of mapped and qualitative data to triangulate issues and suggest solutions. Therefore, option A accurately reflects the NGO's approach to correcting official pothole information and achieving accountability throughout the talk.",

    "model_answer": "answer: C\n\nThe speaker begins by discussing how an NGO used FOSS to resolve the Karnataka pothole issue, which is a specific use case. As the talk progresses, the speaker transitions to explaining the platform's design rationale for NGOs facing messaging API costs, which is a broader movement. The visuals show both speakers collaborating on a laptop, bridging the specific use case to a broader ecosystem. The audio then highlights forking, modification, and community-led solutions, emphasizing the sector-wide, discussion-first ethos. The talk concludes with the IndiaFOSS 2.0 title card, reinforcing the open-source theme. Therefore, option C best describes the evolution of the talk's stance on free and open-source software (FOSS).",

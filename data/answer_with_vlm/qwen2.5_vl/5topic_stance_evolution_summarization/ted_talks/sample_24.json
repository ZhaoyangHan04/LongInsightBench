    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Midway, a young woman recounts being singled out by a third-grade teacher and being forced to retake a reading test, which she passes at the same high level, countering bias. Later, visuals of complex imagery and assessment slides accompany descriptions of teachers who care, helping her come out of her shell. The arc culminates in a proud introduction of her scholarship and long-term goals, with smiling imagery and applause reinforcing a confident self-view.\n\nThis option best captures the development of the student's self-perception and outcomes over time as described in the talk. The narrative starts with a negative experience but progresses through a series of positive developments, including overcoming bias, receiving support from caring teachers, and ultimately achieving success. The visuals and stage visuals mentioned in the talk also align with this progression, showing a shift from negative to positive imagery.",

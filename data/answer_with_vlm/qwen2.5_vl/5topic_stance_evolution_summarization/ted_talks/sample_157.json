She illustrates this with vivid campaign examples such as a cat café, a bold health campaign, a dark-humor soup, and a duck-chasing name. The speaker moves from statistical data to real-life cases, which is evident from the mention of the rustic stage and the screen showing campaign tags like #passion.

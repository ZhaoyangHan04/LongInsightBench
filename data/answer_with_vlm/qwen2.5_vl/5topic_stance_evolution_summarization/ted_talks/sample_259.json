    "model_answer": "The answer is D: He progresses from playful personalization of concepts to experiential trial-and-error, with his tone shifting from inquisitive to instructive to reflective. The imagery tracks from close-ups of reading devices and desk work to him handling a reader while speaking in a serene garden, before a quiet closing. He caps this by framing tinkering as a synthesis of doing, thinking, and feeling.\n\nThis answer is based on the sequence of events described in the video clips. The speaker begins by discussing the concept of tinkering and personalization of ideas, using examples like poetry and e-readers. This is followed by scenes showing close-ups of reading devices and desk work, which could be interpreted as a form of experiential trial-and-error. The speaker then handles a reader while speaking in a serene garden, indicating a shift towards a reflective tone. Finally, the video closes with a quiet scene, suggesting that the speaker has concluded his discussion on the topic. Therefore, option D best describes the development of the speaker's stance on tinkering and personalization of ideas across the later segments of the video.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The talk first frames seventh graders as seekers, with visuals explicitly stating “you are a seeker” and audio describing a liminal stage between child and adult. It then crescendos into a barrage of questions and a slide that shifts from a question mark to a raised fist, signaling empowerment, before likening their curiosity to a recent convert and to taking things apart. The arc concludes with images of exploration and the speaker urging adults to be bold and to embrace this brief transformative window in kids.\n\nThis answer is supported by the content of the video where Amy Selikoff discusses the importance of questioning and curiosity in the early stages of development, emphasizing how it helps children transition from childhood to adulthood. She also mentions the role of adults in fostering this curiosity and the importance of embracing the transformative window in kids. The visual elements in the video, such as the slide showing a question mark shifting to a raised fist, further support this theme.",

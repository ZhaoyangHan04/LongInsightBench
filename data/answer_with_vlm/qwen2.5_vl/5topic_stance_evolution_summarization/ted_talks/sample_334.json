    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: He begins by stressing the cost and energy burden of today’s AI and the CPU–RAM communication bottleneck, then pivots to memristors that store and process in the same place, built as neurons and synapses. The slides reinforce this with “BUILDING THE WORLD’S MOST EFFICIENT, BRAIN-INSPIRED CHIP” and a split-screen diagram of the memristor next to a GEMESYS chip. He then promises 100x speed/efficiency, envisions every processor carrying their chip, and ends by arguing for truly personal models that learn on-device like a phone understanding one person’s speech.\n\nThis summary aligns with the speaker's progression in the video. Initially, the speaker discusses the inefficiencies of current AI systems, particularly focusing on the cost and energy consumption, as well as the communication bottleneck between CPU and RAM. This sets up the context for the introduction of memristors, which are described as a solution that can store and process data simultaneously, mimicking the structure of neurons and synapses in the human brain. The slides support this by showing a comparison between a memristor and a GEMESYS chip, highlighting the efficiency improvements. The speaker then goes on to promise significant speed",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: He highlights a slide claiming the chip is 100x faster and more energy efficient for edge devices and states the vision that every processor will include a GEMESYS AI chip. He then outlines a licensing model with an annual fee and per-chip royalty, shares traction from decades of research, a multi-million-euro grant, and a ~15-person team, and introduces advisors while inviting investors and customers. He closes by restating the brain-like chip and thanking the audience to applause.\n\nThe speaker starts by emphasizing the product's speed and efficiency, then moves on to discuss the licensing model, research background, team size, and advisors. This aligns with option A, which describes a structured approach from product claims to market readiness and credibility, culminating in a call to action.",

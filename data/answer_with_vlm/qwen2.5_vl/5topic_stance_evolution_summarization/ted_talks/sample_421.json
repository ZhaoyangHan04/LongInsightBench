    "model_answer": "Answer: A\n\nThe speaker's central argument about the influence of social networks develops from the early framing to the closing call to action in a structured manner. Initially, he frames human connections as complex webs and asks what networks do to us, using visual aids like a \"Connected\" word cloud and a network diagram. He then transitions to discussing how ties make us healthier and happier, and illustrates broader contagions such as \"Financial Contagion!\" with a historical bank run image. To quantify the spread, he presents a \"Three Degrees of Influence\" slide and examples. Finally, he closes with a practical, motivating appeal to \"PAY IT FORWARD,\" supported by a speaker's testimonial about changing her own behavior to benefit her wider circle. This sequence of development aligns closely with option A, making it the correct choice.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: B\n\nThe speaker begins by contrasting traditional social networks with internet-era platforms, emphasizing the need to bring natural social ties online. He visualizes a dorm network, starting with friendships and expanding to include club and roommate connections, before overlaying Facebook. He argues that photo-based ties indicate meaningful relationships and shows examples of emergent clusters (smilers, overweight groups). The speaker concludes by questioning whether influence effects can be observed and suggests potential targeted interventions. Therefore, option B best captures the evolution of the talk's stance on taking natural social networks online.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A\n\nThe speaker starts by recounting his 1982 sentencing and time in maximum-security prisons, emphasizing his passion against a red backdrop. He then broadens his focus to discuss mass incarceration and the stripping of rehabilitation programs, warning that harsh prison conditions produce worse outcomes. Following this, he describes his involvement in prison reform, including launching Prison Life Magazine, serving as an expert witness, and staying active in reform. He concludes by mentioning that he is starting to teach literacy to incarcerated teens, which aligns with option A. The calm music and appearance of the credits at the end further support this interpretation.",

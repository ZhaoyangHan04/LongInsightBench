    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: The speaker opens by naming horizontal hostility and highlighting the “if you aren’t all in” gatekeeping, then illustrates it with the split in the women’s suffrage movement over the 15th Amendment. She pivots to Audre Lorde’s insistence on turning differences into strengths, before applying the lesson to open source by showing slides about its “masters” and the culture they built, calling out toxicity and exclusionary terminology. The progression moves from definition to historical case study to a modern community critique.\n\nThis option aligns with the structure described in the audio, where the speaker starts by defining horizontal hostility, then uses a historical example (the women's suffrage movement) to illustrate the concept, and finally applies this understanding to the open-source world, critiquing its culture and practices. This matches the logical flow presented in the audio.",

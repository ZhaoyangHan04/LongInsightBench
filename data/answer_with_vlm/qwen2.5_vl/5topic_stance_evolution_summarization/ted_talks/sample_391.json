Therefore, there is insufficient information to answer the question accurately.",

From there, the project scales into a collaborative school that transcends institutions through conversation, culminating in a social and political “ethics of comportment.”\n\nThis answer is supported by the video content which shows a progression from individual, domestic making to a collaborative pedagogy and ethics. The speaker's evolving stance is evident in the transition from the initial frames showing a solitary figure working on a hexagonal structure to the final frames where the text \"J. Morgan Puett: A Practice of Be(e)ing\" appears, indicating a broader perspective on practice. The mention of a \"collaborative school\" and \"ethics of comportment\" further supports option C.",

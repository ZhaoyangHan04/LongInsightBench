    "model_answer": "The answer is A: She begins by presenting imagination as something people use to cover sadness and notes that those imagined things aren’t real, while the screen shows “Dream” and a quote. After a turning point sparked by a resonant photograph, she embraces art as life-saving and world-changing, illustrated by sequences of her artworks on the screen. She concludes by reaffirming aloud—and visually on the screen—that everything she and others can imagine is real.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the information provided in the video where the speaker starts by discussing the concept of imagination and its role in covering sadness. She then transitions into a more positive view of imagination, using her artwork as evidence of its power. Finally, she reinforces the idea that imagination is real and can be used to create meaningful works of art.",

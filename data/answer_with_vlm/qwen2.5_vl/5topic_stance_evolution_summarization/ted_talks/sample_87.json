    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe speaker starts by emphasizing the importance of connectivity and challenges the notion that it is secondary. He introduces himself as Andrew Bellavia and uses a playful flush sound to illustrate his point. He then presents slides with bar graphs showing recall disadvantages and explains that poor laptop speakers worsen outcomes. He introduces LE Audio's lower latency and reliability and expands to Auracast as broadcast audio, visually shifting to different scenes such as a phone with a sports screen, a busy sports bar, and a metro scene. Throughout the talk, he emphasizes the benefits of accessibility for everyone. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

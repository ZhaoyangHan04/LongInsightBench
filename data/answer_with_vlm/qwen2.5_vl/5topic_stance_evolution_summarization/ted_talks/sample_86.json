    "model_answer": "The speaker's stance on the emergence of a \"visible language\" develops through a series of theoretical and experiential demonstrations, supported by shifting visual elements. Initially, the speaker proposes a biological and evolutionary basis for a new, visible language, aligning it with molecular order and epigenetics, as evidenced by grand, symbolic visuals like pyramids and geometric art filling the screen. This is followed by a reframing of the ancient notion of the Logos, which shifts from being heard to being seen, paired with historical and crowd imagery. The speaker then discusses the use of psychedelic practices such as ayahuasca/DMT to make \"hyper words\" visible, accompanied by surreal levitations and winged figures. Finally, the speaker claims that telepathy can be transformed into a culture-wide \"see-what-I-mean\" mode catalyzed by psilocybin, visually echoed by ESP cards and chakra imagery. The progression moves from theory to experiential demonstration to a proposed cultural future.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: After exploring visualized meaning earlier, he explicitly interrogates voice and self-generated sound, asking what it can do and how it affects the organism. He then proposes a molecular mechanism—a real interior tone from electron spin resonance that other sounds can cancel or reinforce—as chakra diagrams and systems charts appear, with a hum entering the soundscape. He ends by highlighting ayahuasca shamans as master “hummers” who operate on bodies with light and sound, calling for experimental study, while visuals include anatomical imagery of the eye/brain and psychedelic scenes that bridge physiology and practice.\n\nThis answer is based on the provided images and the description of the audio content. The speaker discusses the role of sound and physiology in the context of the visuals, which transition from chakra diagrams and systems charts to anatomical imagery of the eye/brain and psychedelic scenes. The speaker also mentions the importance of the hum and its effects on the organism, as well as the role of shamans in operating on bodies with light and sound.",

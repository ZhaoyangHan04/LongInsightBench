    "model_answer": "The video starts with a title card that mentions Meghan Markle's attendance at Misha Nonoo's wedding, which sets up the fashion controversy around her black dress. This is followed by a brief shot of the dress itself, highlighting its features and the reactions it received. Then, the video transitions to a tour of the venue, showing the luxurious surroundings and the high daily rental price. The narration covers the black-tie guests, amenities, and the overall opulence of the event. Finally, the video ends with a standard call-to-action screen, encouraging viewers to subscribe and like the channel.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: It broadens from debate and justification of the black gown amid arrivals and a friendly moment with the designer, then shifts into showcasing the lavish property with explicit price details. The segment closes with the standard channel call-to-action screens after the venue tour.",

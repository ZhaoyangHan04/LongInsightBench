    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: It builds from onstage empowerment—where he tells a cheering crowd they are stars and to never give up—to reflective interview commentary about presenting opportunity and evolving. This then moves into street-level mentorship in a parking lot, with him gifting apparel and urging someone to take their brand seriously. It culminates in social media tributes and a narrator’s emotional reflection on being deeply affected by someone he barely knew.\n\nThis option best captures the progression of the video content as described in the question. The video starts with a scene of XXXTentacion on stage, engaging with a crowd and giving them a sense of empowerment. This is followed by an interview where he discusses the importance of opportunity and personal growth. The video then transitions to a scene in a parking lot where he is seen interacting with a fan, offering advice and encouragement. Finally, the video ends with social media tributes and a narrator reflecting on the impact of XXXTentacion's life and legacy.",

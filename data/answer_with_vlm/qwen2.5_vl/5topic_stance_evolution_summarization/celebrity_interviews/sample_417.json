    "model_answer": "answer: A\n\nThe discussion starts with a sensational tease about a secret tape involving a famous rapper and an R&B singer, which is supported by the on-screen \"HOTTEST RAP & SINGER\" graphic and animated hosting. The hosts then revisit the story, discussing its potential value, whether it still exists, and their attempts to obtain it, while the co-host reacts with shock. The show's set alternates, and the hosts frame such behavior as human, noting that people enjoy these stories. Finally, they explicitly switch gears, visually returning to the show's branded set. This matches option A, where the discussion evolves from a sensational tease to a detailed exploration of the tape's potential value and existence, with the hosts eventually returning to the show's branded set.",

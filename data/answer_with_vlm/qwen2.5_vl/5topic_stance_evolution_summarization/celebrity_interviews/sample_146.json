    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: She first jokes and speaks openly about needing a breast \"renovation,\" then confirms she redid her boobs and had lipo as shown in on-screen quotes. After showing swelling and discussing canceled shows, the narration and on-screen text present recovery as long and difficult. Finally, quotes appear where she says she wonâ€™t get surgery again and is working out instead.\n\nThis answer is supported by the sequence of events described in the video clips. Initially, Cardi B humorously mentions the need for a breast \"renovation.\" Subsequently, she confirms that she has undergone breast augmentation and liposuction, as indicated by the on-screen text. The video also shows her experiencing swelling and canceling shows due to recovery, which is narrated and visually represented. Towards the end, she explicitly states that she will not undergo surgery again and prefers working out instead. Therefore, option A accurately reflects the evolution of her stance on cosmetic surgery based on the provided information.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: The talk opens with on-screen mental health framing and a reflective tone, then moves into Maxwellâ€™s personal story about being misperceived and the need to represent diversity, and culminates in a takeaway about accountability and how words matter. Visually, the \"ON MENTAL HEALTH\" and \"THERAPY SESSIONS\" titles set the stage, their animated gestures keep the exchange engaged, and the same couch-and-bokeh backdrop underscores a continuous, thoughtful arc.\n\nThis option best describes the evolution of the conversation's focus as it begins with a mental health theme, transitions into Maxwell's personal narrative, and concludes with a message about accountability and the importance of words. The visual elements, such as the animated title cards and consistent background, support this progression.",

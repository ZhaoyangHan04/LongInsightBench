    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: Early narration sets a low-key tone, which evolves into concrete habits like turning on music, lighting the fireplace, and watching NBA games with friends in a TV-free living room. Kitchen and courtyard scenes, along with remarks about cooking daily and stepping outside through glass doors, show how the design supports that calm. The closing commentary affirms this grounded philosophy by praising her relaxed, down-to-earth style.\n\nThis option aligns with the video content where Kendall's home-life philosophy is portrayed as low-key and centered around creating a serene environment with character. The video shows various spaces such as a formal living room without a TV, a heavily used kitchen, and an office that opens to a courtyard. These spaces are described as supporting quiet routines with friends, and the overall vibe is praised as down-to-earth. The other options either contradict the video content or do not accurately reflect the development of Kendall's home-life philosophy.",

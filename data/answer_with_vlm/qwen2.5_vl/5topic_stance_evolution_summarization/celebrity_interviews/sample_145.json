    "model_answer": "answer: D: The trajectory moves from an LA incident that prompts selling or renting out a compromised property, to keeping addresses confidential in London, and then to selecting buildings engineered for privacy. The commentary notes anti-paparazzi security and private-elevator access while showing polished condo interiors, signaling a sustained prioritization of safety.\n\nThe narrative in the video segment describes Rihanna's experiences with privacy and security issues in various locations, including an incident in Los Angeles where an intruder broke into her home. This led to a shift towards more secure living situations, such as high-security LA condos designed to thwart paparazzi and featuring private elevators. The video also mentions her move to a secret London setup where she lays low, emphasizing the importance of privacy and security in her living situations. Therefore, option D best captures the evolution of Rihanna's stance on privacy and security in her living situations.",

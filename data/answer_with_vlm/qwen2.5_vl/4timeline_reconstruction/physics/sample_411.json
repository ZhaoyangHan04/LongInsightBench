Then, the operator uses XRD Wizard to create and save a scan method, which corresponds to event (4). Next, in XRD Commander, the generator power is ramped up stepwise on the grid interface, which corresponds to event (5). After that, the operator presses the green “Open Door” button, the Alarm light turns on and the glass door opens, which corresponds to event (2). The sample holder is locked on the stage and the doors are closed, stopping the blinking alarm, which corresponds to event (3). Pressing Start opens the shutter; two red lights illuminate; the goniometer moves and the Busy light turns on, which corresponds to event (6). Finally, after the scan completes, the shutter closes automatically and the sample holder is removed using the latch under the stage, which corresponds to event (7).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is:\n\nA: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7\n\nExplanation: The sequence starts with the Ready and On lights being illuminated on the instrument control panel (1), followed by setting up the XRD Wizard to define the two-theta range and time per step (3). Then, the adjustable sample holder is placed on the sample stage fixture and locked in place (2). Next, the generator voltage/current are ramped in increments with rest periods (4). After that, a new scan is set up by entering a sample ID, selecting a parameter file, and choosing a save location (5). The Start button is then pressed, which opens the shutter, turns on the two red lights, illuminates the Busy light, and the goniometer moves (6). Finally, after completion, the shutter closes automatically, the Move Drives button is pressed, and the sample holder is removed using the latch (7).",

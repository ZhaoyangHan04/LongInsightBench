    "model_answer": "The answer is C: 4 -> 5 -> 8 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 2 -> 6.\n\nExplanation:\nThe sequence of events in the video follows the logical progression of explaining wave optics concepts. The video starts with a slide showing the geometry of the double-slit experiment (step 4). Then, it moves on to the application of the Pythagorean theorem (step 5), which is followed by discussing the conditions for bright and dark fringes (step 8). After that, the concept of path difference is introduced (step 3), leading to the explanation of fringe width (step 1). The next step involves the relationship between phase difference and path difference (step 7), and finally, the intensity distribution is explained (step 2).\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they do not follow the logical flow of the video content. Option A places step 4 after step 5, which is incorrect since step 5 comes before step 4. Option B places step 4 after step 8, which is also incorrect. Option D places step 5 after step 4, which is incorrect.",

The speaker introduces three reference frames first, then shows equations related to velocity and dilation factor, followed by listing events A, B, and C for the Earth twin. Next, a tâ€“x plot is shown with the triangular path, and finally, the speaker explains time dilation and the turnaround between red and green frames, ending with an Einstein quote slide.",

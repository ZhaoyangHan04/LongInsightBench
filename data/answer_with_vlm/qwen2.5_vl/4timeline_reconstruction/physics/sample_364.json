Therefore, the answer is:\n\nanswer: Unable to answer\n\nExplanation: The provided visuals and audio content do not contain any information related to the events listed in the question. The visuals show a balance scale with \"Energy\" and \"Mass\" written on it, which does not relate to the events mentioned in the question. The audio content discusses topics such as neutrons, particle masses, and nuclear processes like fission and fusion, but there is no mention of the specific sequence of events described in the question.",

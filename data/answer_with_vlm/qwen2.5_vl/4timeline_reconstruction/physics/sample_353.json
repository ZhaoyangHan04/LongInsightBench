    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events described in the video segment is:\n\nD: 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4\n\nExplanation:\n- The video starts with a title card \"Quantum Mechanics 1: Birth of the Quantum,\" which introduces the series (Event 5).\n- Then, it transitions to a split-screen showing an old-fashioned and a modern incandescent bulb, where the narrator discusses temperature and light intensity vs. wavelength (Event 1).\n- Next, there's a plain white slide displaying the title \"Physics in the latter years of the nineteenth century,\" indicating that physics seemed largely complete at that time (Event 2).\n- Following this, a portrait of Max Planck labeled 1858â€“1947 appears, with the narrator ironically quoting advice that \"almost everything is already discovered\" (Event 3).\n- Finally, under the same title slide, diagrams progress from mechanics to electromagnetics, ending with a distinct popping sound (Event 4).\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is D: 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.",

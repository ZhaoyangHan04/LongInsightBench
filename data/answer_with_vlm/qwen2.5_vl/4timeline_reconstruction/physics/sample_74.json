    "model_answer": "The correct order of events based on the provided visuals and the narrator's cues is:\n\nC: 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5\n\nExplanation:\n- The video starts with a magnet with N and S poles and field lines, which corresponds to event 3 in the question.\n- Next, a circle with a central + charge appears, which corresponds to event 2 in the question.\n- Then, two charges (+ and −) inside a closed surface are shown, which corresponds to event 4 in the question.\n- After that, the magnet is shown outside a circle while the narrator concludes the net magnetic flux is still zero, which corresponds to event 1 in the question.\n- Finally, both laws are shown side by side (∮B·da = 0 and ∮E·da = Qenc/ε0), which corresponds to event 5 in the question.\n\nThis sequence matches option C.",

    "model_answer": "The correct order of events based on the provided visuals and narration is:\n\nB: 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 4\n\nExplanation:\n- Event 1 is described as showing ∮B·da = 0 beneath diagrams, which matches the first visual.\n- Event 3 involves multiple bar magnets appearing with the text \"NO MAGNETIC MONOPOLES!!\", which aligns with the third visual.\n- Event 5 shows a grey circle and a magnet with a moving yellow dot, where the narrator asks to pause and reveals the flux is zero, matching the fifth visual.\n- Event 6 describes the narrator explaining field lines forming closed loops and the number leaving equaling the number entering, which corresponds to the sixth visual.\n- Event 2 talks about a 90-year search for magnetic monopoles and how finding one would change the equations, which fits the second visual.\n- Event 4 mentions discussing Maxwell equations in upcoming videos, which is consistent with the final visual.\n\nTherefore, the sequence B: 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 4 correctly reconstructs the timeline of the sub-events.",

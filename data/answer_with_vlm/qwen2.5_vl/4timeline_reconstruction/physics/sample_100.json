This is followed by the wooden contraption being released, which corresponds to event (2).\n- Then, the speaker rewrites the equations as x1' = x2 and x2' = -(g/ℓ) sin x1, which corresponds to event (4).\n- Finally, the speaker adds the -k x2 term to the second equation, identifying K as the friction parameter, which corresponds to event (5).\n\nThe events follow the logical progression of the presentation, starting with the introduction, presenting the differential equation, showing the physical system, rewriting the equations, and finally adding the friction term.",

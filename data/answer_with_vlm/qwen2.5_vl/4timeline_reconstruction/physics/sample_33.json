This is the first event mentioned in the sequence.\n   \n2. **Event 4**: The Einstein râ€“ict diagram is shown as the speaker defines imaginary coherent time and mentions the Maldacena correspondence. This follows logically after discussing the concept of time.\n\n3. **Event 1**: The circular \"reference clock\" diagram appears as the speaker says the absolute time beat becomes a reference clock. This comes next in the sequence, as it is related to the discussion about time and clocks.\n\n4. **Event 3**: A low, resonant didgeridoo-like note fades out right after discussion of \"absolute time\" and \"surface quantum foam\" shown alongside AdS/CFT visuals. This event follows the discussion about clocks and time.\n\n5. **Event 5**: The 3D star-like network is shown while the speaker says this allows non-locality and that the universe",

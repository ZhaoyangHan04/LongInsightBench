    "model_answer": "The timeline of the lecture segments based on the provided visuals and spoken cues is:\n\n1. A static title slide with a blue header reading \"The Solenoid\" is displayed.\n2. The speaker says, \"so that's the ideal solenoid.\"\n3. A close-up copper-colored solenoid appears with on-screen text defining a solenoid as many loops of wire.\n4. A diagram shows magnetic field lines around a solenoid with a red-boxed equation \"B = μ₀ n I.\"\n5. The speaker states, \"This concludes the lecture on the solenoidal magnetic field.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct order is C: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 6\n\nExplanation: The speaker starts by introducing the Stage 1 board and defining the condition for losing contact (N=0), which is the first event. Then, the speaker applies the work-energy theorem on Stage 1, which is the second event. Next, the speaker introduces Stage 2 conceptually and explains how to transform the cycloidal motion into circular motion, which is the third event. After that, the speaker discusses the radius for circular motion and relative velocity in the moving frame, which is the fourth event. The fifth event is the derivation phase where the speaker eliminates unknowns using boxed relations, substitutions, and squaring steps. Finally, the speaker concludes by matching the answer book and highlighting the key technique of transforming cycloidal to circular motion, which is the sixth event.",

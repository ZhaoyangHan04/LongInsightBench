Then, she explains the sled hitting a shock absorber and air hissing, which aligns with moment 4. The loud crash sound cutting in corresponds to moment 1, and the labeled graph peaks near 25 g while she says a typical pulse is about 20-25 Gs, which corresponds to moment 3. Therefore, the correct chronological order is B: 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 3.",

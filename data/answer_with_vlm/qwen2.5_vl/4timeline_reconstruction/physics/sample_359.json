Then, a hand places a curved glass lens onto a plate as the setup is explained (4), followed by hands pressing on the lens and adjusting the angle to try to see something (1). Next, an '8x' magnifying glass is used to view a small dark dot on a glass slide (6), and finally, a ring-making paperweight with thumbscrews is opened/adjusted as the speaker identifies it as producing Newton's rings (3).",

    "model_answer": "The correct order of events is:\n\n4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1\n\nThis sequence follows the logical progression of the video content. The experimenter first lights a lighter (event 4), then describes the plan to compare laser light with a white desk lamp using a top-down shot (event 2). After that, the concentric rings are shown under white, then green/blue/red illumination (event 5), followed by the description of a half white light, half laser comparison where the laser rings line up with white-light rings (event 3). Finally, the recap shows concentric red/green rings through a lens and then end credits roll as jazzy music returns (event 1).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1.",

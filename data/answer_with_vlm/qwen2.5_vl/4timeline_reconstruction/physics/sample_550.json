    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is:\n\n1. A title card reading \"Ask a Physicist Episode 9 part 1 Nuclear Weapons\" appears.\n2. The host cites Hiroshima and Nagasaki as a black-and-white mushroom cloud fills the screen.\n3. An explosion sound interrupts as the on-screen title \"Nuclear Reactions: a simple overview\" appears.\n4. The equation E=mc^2 fills the screen as the host links the energy source to Einstein.\n5. A hand stretches a red rubber band during a potential energy analogy.\n6. Black-and-white images of \"Fat Man\" and \"Little Boy\" appear, followed by \"Continued in Part 2\" while upbeat blues rock plays.\n\nThis sequence is supported by the visual and audio cues provided in the video. The title card appears first, followed by the explosion sound and the title \"Nuclear Reactions: a simple overview.\" Then, the equation E=mc^2 is shown, followed by the potential energy analogy with the rubber band. Finally, the black-and-white images of the atomic bombs and the upbeat blues rock music indicate that this is the end of the episode.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 ->",

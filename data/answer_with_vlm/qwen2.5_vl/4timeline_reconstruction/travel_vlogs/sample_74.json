Then he comments on the current being strong (moment 4). Next, we see a gloved hand holding up a small gold nugget to the camera underwater (moment 3). After finding the nugget, he exclaims, \"found a nice little nugget\" (moment 1). Finally, he gives a tip about cracks running with the river holding gold and encourages viewers to watch to the end (moment 5).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events in the video is:\n\n1. The host opens with a dramatic orchestral intro, welcomes viewers to investigate a Japanese island, and wind rush is heard.\n2. He says they were shown a movie briefing about Godzilla’s capture and a zipline plan, while posters and Godzilla surfacing visuals appear.\n3. In a green-walled indoor range, arcade effects and a monster roar play while voices remind “you have to hide.”\n4. At the Anti-Godzilla Cell Sniper station, he reads the guidelines and action-like electronic game music begins as he prepares to shoot.\n5. He ziplines through the forest into a giant mouth, jokes about fresh breath and pretty teeth, and a child asks if Godzilla is okay.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5.",

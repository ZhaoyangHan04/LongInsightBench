    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The first event (1) shows a mountain road through the car window, indicating that the trip has started.\n2. The third event (3) shows the person saying they are heading to Arizona, which suggests this is early in the trip before reaching their destination.\n3. The second event (2) indicates that they have arrived at their destination and are now in a dim room.\n4. The fourth event (4) shows the person tying their shoes and mentioning their belongings, which implies they are preparing to leave their destination.\n5. The sixth event (6) shows the person sitting in an airport waiting area, indicating they have arrived at the airport.\n6. The fifth event (5) shows the person walking through the airport and figuring out which gates to go to, which happens after arriving at the airport.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is:\n\n1. At the gate area, she says, \"We only got like an hour of time to kill,\" while seated and putting in earbuds.\n2. She says, \"Here we go,\" as engine noise revs; she stands, pulls her suitcase, and walks through the airport.\n3. Onboard, intercom announcements cover exit-row rules and not forgetting personal items while she adjusts her mask.\n4. In flight, the camera shows the wing with clear skies while electronic synth music plays and she reads a book.\n5. After landing, she calls saying, \"I'm in terminal 3... coming out to parking,\" while following signs to ground transportation.\n6. Outside, she remarks about the heat and humidity, greets someone, and a car door closes.\n\nThis sequence follows the events described in the audio and matches option B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is D: 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5.\n\nExplanation:\nThe audio mentions \"your roving reporter, Big Ron Devo\" which indicates that this is the first moment captured in the video. This corresponds to option 2. Next, we hear a child saying \"hi\" and an adult confirming it's \"New Edition,\" which matches option 3. Then, there's a shot of a man placing a coin on the star, which aligns with option 1. Following this, we see a busy sidewalk scene where people are talking about retaking a picture, which corresponds to option 4. The family sitting by a star with a countdown and positioning directions fits with option 6. Lastly, someone asks \"Where did the picture go?\" which corresponds to option 5. Therefore, the correct chronological order is 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5.",

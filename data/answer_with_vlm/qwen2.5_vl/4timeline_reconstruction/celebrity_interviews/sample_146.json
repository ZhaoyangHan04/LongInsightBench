Then it transitions to a montage showing Cardi visibly pregnant on stage (event 1), followed by colorful squares transitioning as the host begins detailing pre-pregnancy procedures (event 3). Next, there is a fitting scene showing a woman in a white bikini being measured while the speaker talks about boobs redone and lipo (event 4). After that, a close-up of swollen feet with on-screen text about flying plays as the speaker explains swelling and canceled shows (event 5). The host then reads on-screen social media comments, including a harsh insult and praise for Rihanna's natural beauty (event 7). Finally, the host invites viewers on Instagram to discuss Cardi's transformation and signs off (event 8).",

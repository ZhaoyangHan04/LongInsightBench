    "model_answer": "answer: D: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5\n\nExplanation: The timeline starts with the host welcoming a special Bullet Club show (1), followed by a close-up of a hand igniting a lighter (2). Then, the host's voice is heard introducing a message from \"my main man\" Hangman Page (2 again). Next, the speaker threatens to snap fingers and shove hair down someone's throat in front of metal ladders (4). The scene then cuts to a British-accented voice saying \"Villain, you're up,\" which tees up the match between Marty Scurll and Hangman vs. Kushida and Tanahashi (3). After that, the host declares it's time for the main event, says Kenny Omega beat Okada, and calls himself \"the man who beat the man who beat the man\" (6). Finally, a man wearing a Bullet Club tank top by a wooden door says Bullet Club is coming to San Francisco on July 7 and wonders who SF would love to party with (5).",

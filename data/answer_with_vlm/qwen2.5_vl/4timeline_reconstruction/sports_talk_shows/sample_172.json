    "model_answer": "The answer is B: 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3\n\nExplanation: The speaker starts by calling it \"one of the more incredible nights in Yankee Stadium history,\" mentioning DraftKings, as #99 stands with a bat pre-at-bat. This corresponds to event 2. Then, there's a mention of a first pitch fastball and the count building as #99 swings and misses against #29, which corresponds to event 4. Next, there's an excited call of a homer bouncing off the railing into the bleachers, where an away-jersey fan ends up with the ball amid a crowd eruption, which corresponds to event 5. Following this, there's a frantic stands scene where a man says \"I got it,\" tucks something away, and escapes while people shove, which corresponds to event 1. Finally, the speaker reflects on \"Judge 60th homerun,\" noting the easy swing, gentle bat drop, and lack of celebration as #99 makes contact and runs, which corresponds to event 3.",

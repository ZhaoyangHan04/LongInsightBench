    "model_answer": "The video starts by showing a diagram labeled \"quarterback\" where the speaker jokes about him selling insurance after retiring. This corresponds to option 4. Next, it shows a diagram labeled \"running backs\" with HB and FB, indicating that the speaker is explaining the different types of running backs, which aligns with option 5. Then, the video shows a wide receiver in blue leaping for a catch while the speaker explains wide receivers and the slot receiver, which corresponds to option 1. Following this, the speaker concludes with \"That's offense\" over a formation labeled offensive line, quarterback, and running backs, which matches option 2. Finally, the word \"defense\" is highlighted and \"4-3 defense\" text appears as the speaker describes tackles and ends, which corresponds to option 3. Therefore, the correct order is C: 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 3.",

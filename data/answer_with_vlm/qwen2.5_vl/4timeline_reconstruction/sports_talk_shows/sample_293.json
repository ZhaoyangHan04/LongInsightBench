Then he compares his uninjured and injured thumbs, noting pain with downward pressure (option 4). Next, he specifies using tearable rigid tape and starting from the back of the thumb (option 6). After that, he instructs to start taping at the back of the wrist “bump” and wrap over the thenar eminence (option 5). Finally, he warns not to tighten the tape too much around the wrist to protect circulation (option 1), and ends the tutorial with a brief music sting and says “See you next time” (option 2).",

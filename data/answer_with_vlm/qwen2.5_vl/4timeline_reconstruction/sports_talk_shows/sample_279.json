The summary is read stating no significant effect (3), followed by an EMG study showing that clipless pedals result in less EMG, but the study didn't assess efficiency (1). Finally, the host asks viewers to like, subscribe, and share, saying he'll see them in the next video (4).",

The video content seems to be focused on comparing clipless and flat pedals, and the audio mentions stationary tests missing climbing differences. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the correct chronological order based on the given information.",

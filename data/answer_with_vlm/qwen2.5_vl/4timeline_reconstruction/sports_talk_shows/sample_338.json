The opening of the video shows a black screen transitioning to white with the FanDuel logo and the word \"HURRY\" underneath it. This corresponds to event 3 in the list.\n2. After this, the host introduces Joe Raineri and mentions \"betting 101 tips,\" which aligns with event 5.\n3. The host then begins explaining spread betting using the Chiefs vs 49ers game, which corresponds to event 1.\n4. Next, parlay bets are discussed with the example of the Nets, Heat, and Lakers, which corresponds to event 4.\n5. The \"Teasers\" section is then introduced with six- and seven-point adjustments, which corresponds to event 2.\n6. Finally, the host thanks Joe Raineri and says \"good night,\" which corresponds to event 6.\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order is B: 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 6.",

This corresponds to option 4. Then, the over/under is defined as betting on totals higher or lower, with a stadium backdrop, which matches option 1. Next, straight bets are defined with an example about Patrick Mahomes, and the FanDuel menu is visible, which aligns with option 3. After that, parlays are explained using the Nets, Heat, and Lakers, with a large HURRY banner visible, which corresponds to option 5. Finally, teasers are explained with the Chiefs vs 49ers game, and the shots alternate between cityscapes and stadiums, which fits with option 2. Therefore, the correct chronological order is 4 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 2.",

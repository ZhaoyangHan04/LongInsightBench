The host starts by mentioning \"the good, the bad, and the downright ugly,\" which corresponds to the \"THE GOOD\" title card (Event 3). This suggests that Event 3 happens before Event 5, where the host says he won't recap matches and will cover \"the good, the bad, and the downright ugly.\"\n\n2. The host then praises victory laps and mentions the \"Logan Paul Levec era,\" which corresponds to the \"NEW CHAMPS’ VICTORY LAPS\" header (Event 6). This indicates that Event 6 follows Event 3.\n\n3. The host then says \"You forgot about us\" and wonders about Uncle Howdy's return, which corresponds to the \"LATEST UNCLE HOWDY EASTER EGG\" graphic (Event 4). This suggests that Event 4 comes after Event 6.\n\n4. The host mentions Tama Tonga's arrival and a Bloodline civil war, which corresponds to the \"THE DOWNRIGHT UGLY\" card (Event 1).

The green \"SOLID QUALIFIER MATCHES\" title (Event 3) is the first event mentioned in the audio, so it must be the first in the sequence.\n2. The host then mentions \"Match clips roll\" (Event 7), which follows the qualifier matches.\n3. The red taped text about The Rock vs Cody and a possible \"belt versus belt\" (Event 1) comes next.\n4. The red \"ANOTHER WWE CONTRACT EXPIRING SOON?\" card (Event 5) is mentioned after the contract expiration topic.\n5. The celebration segment announcing Jon Moxley’s achievement (Event 6) follows the contract expiration discussion.\n6. The Natalya montage (Event 2) is mentioned after the celebration segment.\n7. Finally, the host recalls Cody’s SmackDown promo (Event 4).\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order is B: 3 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 4.",

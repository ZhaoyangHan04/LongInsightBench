    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\n\nHere's the reasoning based on the provided information:\n\n1. The narrator introduces the tutorial on fixing Windows 10 sound problems (Event 1).\n2. The cursor right-clicks the speaker icon and selects \"Troubleshoot sound problems\" (Event 2).\n3. The Sound window opens to Playback devices showing Speakers as the default device (Event 3).\n4. The narrator explains to open Speakers properties, go to the Advanced tab, and test audio formats (Event 4).\n5. In Speakers Properties > Advanced, clicking Test triggers a \"Device in Use\" warning and the user confirms Yes (Event 5).\n6. The narrator reassures that if itâ€™s not working, there are still ways to fix it (Event 6).\n\nThe sequence of events follows the logical steps of troubleshooting sound problems on Windows 10, starting with introducing the tutorial, then moving through the process of opening the Sound window, accessing the Advanced tab, testing audio formats, and finally reassuring the user about alternative solutions if needed. Therefore, option B is the correct chronological order.",

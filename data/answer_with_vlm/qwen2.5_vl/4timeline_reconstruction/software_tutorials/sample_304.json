    "model_answer": "The correct order is C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\n\nExplanation: The speaker starts by introducing the website where VirtualBox can be downloaded, which corresponds to event 1. Then, the speaker selects the VirtualBox 4.1.14 for Windows host download, leading to a Save File prompt, which is event 2. After that, a folder named \"VirtualBox\" is created/renamed inside Downloads, indicating event 3. Event 4 follows, where the download manager shows both the VirtualBox .exe and an Ubuntu ISO downloading, and the speaker suggests checking the user manual while waiting. Event 5 comes after the download is almost complete, where the speaker notes the last few seconds of the download and mentions the next step is to set up on Windows 7. Finally, event 6 occurs during the setup process when a warning about network interfaces appears, and the speaker clicks Yes to proceed.",

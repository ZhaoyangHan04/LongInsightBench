Therefore, the answer is:\n\nanswer: Unable to answer\n\nExplanation: The audio does not contain any information about the specific steps mentioned in the question, such as configuring the modem, disabling Wi-Fi radios, or setting up the WAN type. Without this context, it's impossible to reconstruct the correct chronological order of the events.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\n\nExplanation: The events described in the video seem to follow this sequence:\n\n1. The presenter introduces disabling AT&T DHCP so a home router controls the network and says “get on with it” while the title is on screen.\n2. The speaker instructs to unplug the power cable before configuring the home router.\n3. The modem's back label (SSID/password and http://192.168.1.254) is shown while the speaker explains how to find the IP and notes a wired connection doesn't need the Wi-Fi password.\n4. An ASUS router login attempt shows an incorrect username/password error on its login page.\n5. On the ASUS LAN page, with background music, the speaker emphasizes the third number of the IP should not be \"1\" (e.g., use 192.168.2.1) and to apply/save.\n6. The video ends with a spoken good-luck wish over mellow synth music and a thank-you/disclaimer screen.",

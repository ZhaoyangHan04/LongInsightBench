Then, he sets a texture coordinate tiling default to 0.5 for micro variation, which is event 2. Next, he blends microcolor and microcolor variation into Base Color, saves, and previews the result, which is event 3. After that, he adds macro variation noise with a \"noise contrast\" parameter and compares results, which is event 4. Then, he remarks it's almost impossible to tell it's the same tiling texture, then demonstrates tiling on a long landscape strip, which is event 5. Finally, the Patreon supporters end card appears as he asks for a thumbs up and subscription, which is event 6.",

The audio only discusses breaking up tiling textures in Unreal Engine 5 and does not mention the specific steps related to the grass texture or the creation of a macro variation blend. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine the correct order of the steps.",

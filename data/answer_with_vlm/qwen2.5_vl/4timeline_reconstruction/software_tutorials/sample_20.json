Then, the on-screen text \"LICK 1\" appears as he talks about putting the index finger on the target note, which corresponds to moment (3). Next, there's a close-up on his hands while he explains bending on the B string to match another finger, which corresponds to moment (2). After that, he says he'll \"take this further\" and demonstrates another double-stop that squeals, which corresponds to moment (4). Following this, he describes pre-bending, plucking, damping, then bending up to pitch, and calls it \"really crazy sounding stuff,\" which corresponds to moment (6). Finally, he explains a tiny pre-bend on the B string to make the note out of pitch, then plays the horrible sound, which corresponds to moment (5).",

Then, he mentions a third type of pattern used by Joe Satriani (option 3). After that, he introduces LICK 3 and counts triplets out loud (option 4). Next, he advises starting with an upstroke and going \"100% up and down,\" then the melody is repeated faster (option 5). Finally, he explains how he ends fast phrases with a double staccato, followed by a brief brass-like burst (option 6).",

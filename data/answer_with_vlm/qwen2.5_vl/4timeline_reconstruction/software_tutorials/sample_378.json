    "model_answer": "The answer is C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\n\nExplanation: The video starts by introducing the five privacy programs, with PeerBlock being noted as Windows-only. This corresponds to event (1). Then, the presenter explains that on Chromium's incognito/new tab info page, it won't store history or cookies after the session, which aligns with event (2). Next, the presenter discusses how closing the window only protects local data when visiting Craigslist, which corresponds to event (3). Following this, the presenter explains how Tor reroutes traffic through multiple computers to protect identity, which matches event (4). Event (5) involves the presenter explaining that the Tor check page shows the browser is configured to use Tor, and it has incognito-like behavior. Finally, event (6) describes visiting Craigslist through Tor and how closing Tor is sufficient to protect the user's identity.",

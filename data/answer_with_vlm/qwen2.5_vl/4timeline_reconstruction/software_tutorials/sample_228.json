The speaker starts by introducing himself as Kevin Powell, which corresponds to event (1).\n2. He then mentions a one-line CSS solution to the anchor-link problem, which aligns with event (4).\n3. Following this, he states that he'll solve the issue using CSS first, then add a JavaScript and custom property approach, which corresponds to event (3).\n4. Next, he demonstrates scroll-padding-top using 300px, showing a visible gap after clicking a section, which matches event (5).\n5. He then notes the sticky navigation still covers the section titles when jumping to them, which corresponds to event (6).\n6. Finally, he reduces the scroll offset value to about 100px and remarks on the use of magic numbers, suggesting a variable instead, which aligns with event (2).\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order is B: 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 3 -> 5 -> 2.",

Then, he logs the navigation height in the browser console (3). Next, he describes using a CSS custom property fallback for scroll padding as a progressive enhancement (1). After that, he sets a custom property via setProperty and corrects it by adding \"px\" to the value (4). He then fine-tunes by subtracting one pixel for precise alignment and says it's working as intended (5). He warns about resizing and suggests using a ResizeObserver to update values (6). Finally, he thanks supporters/patrons and jokingly tells Intel to improve their internet (7).",

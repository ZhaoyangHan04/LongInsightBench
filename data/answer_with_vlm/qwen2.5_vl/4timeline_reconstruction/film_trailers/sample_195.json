    "model_answer": "The answer is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\n\nExplanation: The video starts with the host welcoming viewers and promising a breakdown (1). Then, there's a transition to on-screen text asking about the best music for videos while \"Artlist.io\" is typed, and a man suggests checking Artlist, ending with a jarring sound (2). Next, we see a male voice declaring, \"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you freedom,\" and a dance track starts as the editor in a yellow sweater works (3). Following this, the narrator describes the commercial's unique features while a pop hook sings \"It's all for you,\" and a shout of \"Freedom!\" punches through (4). Finally, the speaker explains the song's theme of creative freedom and quotes \"So fresh, so new\" and \"It's all for you\" (5).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7\n\nExplanation: The host starts by welcoming viewers and saying she'll break down a trailer (1). Then, the trailer opens on the Italian Riviera with a small fishing boat (2). Next, as an Italian version of “You Are My Sunshine” plays, the screen shows “FROM THE CREATORS OF COCO” over two boys by the sea at dusk (3). After that, a horror-music montage shows humans attacking sea monsters, including a statue fountain slaying one (4). Following this, Luca and Alberto leap from the ocean and transform back into humans midair (5). The wall-painted title “Luca” appears (6), and finally, a “SUMMER 2021” slate appears and the host thanks viewers, asks to like/subscribe, and wishes a magical day (7).",

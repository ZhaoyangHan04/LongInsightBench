    "model_answer": "The answer is B: 2 -> 6 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3\n\nExplanation: The narrator's voice-over provides the necessary context to reconstruct the sequence of events. The narrator first mentions turning off edit mode (2), then requests an OpenWeatherMap forecast window (6). Next, the narrator uses a browser-based Peak Finder view to identify the Eiger (4). Following this, the narrator adds a virtual geocache's coordinates as a waypoint with a comment (1). The track is then exported as a GPX file and saved to the GPS receiver (5). Finally, the narrator thanks the viewers for watching (3).",

Then, it transitions to the outdoor park where the man says \"enjoy the hunt\" (event 3), indicating that this is the next event after the treasure chest appears. Following this, the man is seen holding up a shiny item in a sauna, talking about an 18-karat ring with diamonds set in 14-karat white gold (event 2). Next, he is at the lake's edge, calling a \"78 signal\" and suspecting silver while uncovering a ring-shaped item (event 4). After this, he announces a \"90 signal\" and identifies a 1946 silver dime (event 6). Finally, he notes a foil-like sound and finds a Buffalo nickel on the surface (event 5), and he confirms \"14k\" inside a ring, with dramatic orchestral music beginning (event 7). Therefore, the correct chronological order is option A.",

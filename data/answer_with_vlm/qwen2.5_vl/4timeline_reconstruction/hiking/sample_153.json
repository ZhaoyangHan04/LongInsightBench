    "model_answer": "The answer is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7\n\nExplanation: The audio starts with the hikers introducing Baker Mountain as their first Saranac Sixer beside the trail sign, which corresponds to moment 1 in the list. Then, the hikers remark that the trail is \"pretty much straight up\" after a rainstorm as they ascend a rocky path, which corresponds to moment 2. As they continue hiking, the speaker mentions being \"over halfway there\" and anticipating \"hand over hand\" up a ridge, which corresponds to moment 3. Later, the speaker notes a steep incline, points out the village of Saranac Lake, and clarifies the visible lake is Lake Flower, which corresponds to moment 4. The speaker then says they are near the top, jokes about being \"Sir Edmund Hillary,\" and enjoys a panoramic view, which corresponds to moment 5. Finally, the speaker identifies themselves at the summit marker, which is shown with on-screen time info, and announces it's time to head down from the summit, which corresponds to moment 6. The last part of the audio shows them descending, which corresponds to moment 7.",

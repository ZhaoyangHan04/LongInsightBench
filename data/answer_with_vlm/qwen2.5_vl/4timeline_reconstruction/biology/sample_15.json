    "model_answer": "The answer is D: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9\n\nExplanation: The events in the shuffled list are related to the history of abiogenesis research. The speaker begins by discussing Harold Urey's calculations, which is event 1. Then, the speaker describes the 1953 continuous spark discharge experiment and lists amino acids, which is event 2. Event 3 follows, where the text confirms that key molecules of life could be synthesized on primitive Earth, tying it to the origin of life. Event 5 shows a diagram of the Miller-Urey apparatus, which is relevant to the experiment described in event 2. Event 4 mentions that the view of a highly reducing early atmosphere was challenged in the late 20th century. Event 6 notes that meteorite analysis revealed similar compounds, which is relevant to the discussion of the early atmosphere. Event 7 talks about the first cellular forms arising about 2 billion years ago, which is a later development in the timeline. Finally, event 8 concludes the episode by mentioning abiogenesis and promising future episodes on biodiversity, followed by event 9, where credits roll and music plays.",

The last event (3) is the skeletal muscle slide where the speaker describes striations and nuclei along the edges of tubular fibers, which logically comes after discussing the skeletal muscle itself. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is:\n\nA: 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6 -> 1 -> 4\n\nExplanation: The speaker begins with a black slide listing Excitability, Contractility, Elasticity, and then states that muscles only pull, not push. This corresponds to option 2. Next, the speaker moves to a slide on the basic structure of skeletal muscle, calling it an organ and noting that slides mirror concept checks, which aligns with option 5. Then, the speaker discusses the attachment of muscles to bones, defining tendon, origin, and insertion, and mentions the biceps example, corresponding to option 3. Following this, the speaker names various muscles, giving examples like gluteus maximus, deltoid, trapezius, and biceps brachii/femoris, which matches option 6. Finally, the speaker explains the naming system by action and fiber direction, defining terms such as extensor/flexor digitorum, obliques, and rectus abdominis, and defines \"costal\" as ribs, which corresponds to option 1. Lastly, the speaker mentions the external and internal intercostals being between the ribs and refers to \"spare ribs,\" which fits with option",

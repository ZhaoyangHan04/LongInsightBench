    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events is:\n\nA: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\n\nExplanation: The speaker begins by using an airport passport control analogy while the \"Cell Membrane or Plasma Membrane\" slide with bulleted functions stays on screen (event 1). Then, the slide changes to \"Structure of Cell Membrane\" with a colorful bilayer diagram as the speaker details lipids, proteins, and cholesterol (event 2). Next, a \"Membrane Proteins\" slide appears and the speaker states membranes are about 50% protein and 50% lipid by weight, with 5â€“10% carbohydrates (event 3). After that, a \"Fluid Mosaic Model\" slide shows three integral protein types while the speaker says they are embedded, folded, and span the membrane via alpha- or beta-helices (event 4). Finally, the \"Plasma Membrane & Disease\" slide with a healthy vs cystic fibrosis diagram is displayed as the speaker warns that damaging membrane integrity has severe consequences (event 5).\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they do not follow the logical sequence of events in the video.",

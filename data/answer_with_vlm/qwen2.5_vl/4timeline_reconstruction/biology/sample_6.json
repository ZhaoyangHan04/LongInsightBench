    "model_answer": "The events in the video occur in the following order:\n\n1. The male narrator identifies \"kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra\" as a hand labels them on a white urinary system diagram.\n2. On a side/back view, a hand labels T12 and L4 vertebrae while the narrator notes the right kidney's position relative to the liver.\n3. Bullet-point text of kidney functions appears while a female speaker mentions erythropoietin, renin, and active vitamin D.\n4. A rocky island \"brain break\" shot appears with the words \"brain break\" as somber piano plays.\n5. A kidney diagram fills the screen as a male narrator describes striated renal pyramids, the renal papilla, and minor-to-major calyces leading to the renal pelvis.\n6. A sunset yoga \"brain break\" scene with \"urinary system\" and Arabic text appears as narration gives way to a gentle folk song.\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order is option C: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The events described in the video follow a specific sequence:\n\n1. The video begins with a scene labeled \"Urinary System\" with Arabic text, accompanied by gentle folk music.\n2. The speaker then proceeds to enumerate the five kidney segments over a dual-kidney diagram.\n3. The speaker mentions that segmental classification aids in surgical planning for partial nephrectomies, and the view broadens to show a posterior body view with kidneys.\n4. The narrator describes ureter length and function, with upbeat electronic music starting and ending the segment with a distinct whooshing sound.\n\nBased on this sequence, the correct chronological order is:\n\nC: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4\n\nThis order matches the events described in the video, where the urinary system scene with Arabic text and music comes first, followed by the enumeration of kidney segments, then the broader view of the posterior body with kidneys, and finally the description of ureter length and function with music and a whooshing sound.",

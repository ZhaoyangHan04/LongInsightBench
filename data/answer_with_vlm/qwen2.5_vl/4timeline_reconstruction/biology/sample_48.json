The speaker starts by defining population density in terms of crowdedness and provides the formula on screen (sub-event 1).\n2. The speaker then compares Mumbai and Delhi's population densities (sub-event 2).\n3. The speaker moves on to discuss the challenges of physically counting everything and introduces the concept of density notes and formulas (sub-event 4).\n4. The speaker then shifts focus to discussing competition for resources and the impact of high population density (sub-event 3).\n5. Finally, the speaker introduces biomass density and compares the biomass of a banyan tree with that of carrot grass plants (sub-event 6), followed by the scene shift to the garden (sub-event 5).\n\nThis sequence logically follows the flow of the presentation, starting with the definition of population density, moving on to comparisons, discussing the challenges of counting everything, and finally introducing biomass density and its importance.",

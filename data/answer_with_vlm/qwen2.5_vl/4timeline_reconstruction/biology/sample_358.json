Then she proceeds to define reversible on/off gene expression, which is option 4. Next, she mentions the Hin recombinase flipping orientation, which is option 1. After that, she talks about the structural features of Salmonella, including the flagellum, which is option 5. Finally, she explains the importance of phase variation, including immune evasion and TLR5 stimulation, which is option 3.",

    "model_answer": "The events in the sequence should be reconstructed as follows:\n\n1. The narrator says \"take a glass of water\" and points out the ink–water interface is distinct. (This is the initial setup where the narrator introduces the experiment.)\n2. The blue ink droplet descends into the water as the narrator asks, \"how does this happen?\" (This event occurs after the initial setup, where the narrator poses a question about what will happen next.)\n3. The on-screen definition appears: \"Diffusion: The movement of molecules from a highly concentrated region to a less concentrated region,\" as the narrator names the process. (This event happens after the ink has been introduced into the water, and the narrator explains the concept of diffusion.)\n4. The caption \"Mixture becomes homogenous\" appears while the narrator says the molecules intermingle and the ink is diffused. (This event occurs at the end of the process, where the narrator describes the final result.)\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.\n\nFinal Answer: A",

    "model_answer": "The events described in the shuffled order should be reconstructed as follows:\n\n1. The porous pot is covered and hydrogen gas is supplied to the setup.\n2. With hydrogen, the liquid level in the closed end of the U-tube falls while the open end rises, explained as faster diffusion of hydrogen into the pot.\n3. The setup is changed to replace hydrogen with carbon dioxide.\n4. With carbon dioxide, the U-tube levels reverse, indicating decreased pressure, with a male voice noting CO2’s higher density.\n5. The equation \"Diffusion ∝ 1 / Density of diffusing gas\" is shown as the narrator concludes the inverse relation.\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order is B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.",

The video starts with the title slide \"Insights from the Genetics of Obesity,\" which corresponds to event (2).\n2. Following that, there is a slide titled \"Identification of leptin as a rare syndromic form of obesity,\" which corresponds to event (4).\n3. Next, a slide titled \"Syndromic vs polygenic alleles\" appears, which corresponds to event (3).\n4. Finally, the slide showing a brain-fat diagram with a red \"no\" symbol over leptin and mentioning individuals OB1 and OB2 corresponds to event (1).\n\nTherefore, the correct order is 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1.",

Then, the speaker introduces the concept of Western blot (3), followed by the explanation of temperature-dependent sex determination and climate impacts on turtle sex (2). Afterward, the speaker discusses the Western blot results showing AMH bands for males and Actin bands for females (4). Finally, the speaker concludes that AMH is present in males and absent in females, which is verified by laparoscopy, and a male voice responds (5).\n\nTherefore, the correct order is C: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.",

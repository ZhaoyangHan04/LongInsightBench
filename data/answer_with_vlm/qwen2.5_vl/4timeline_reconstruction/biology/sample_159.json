Next, the title \"Principle of anther and pollen culture\" appears with a red dot on the anther as the speaker describes diverting normal pollen development to a vegetative pathway (event 4). Finally, a slide titled \"Method of anther culture\" lists steps including 70% ethanol while the speaker explains collecting unopened buds and selecting anthers using the aceto-carmine test (event 5).",

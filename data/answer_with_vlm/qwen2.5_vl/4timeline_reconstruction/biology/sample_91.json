    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is B: 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The speaker begins by discussing the pancreas and its location, which corresponds to slide 2 in the sequence.\n2. Next, the speaker talks about the exocrine function of the pancreas, which involves the production of digestive enzymes that go to the small intestine. This aligns with slide 4.\n3. Then, the speaker moves on to discuss the endocrine function of the pancreas, specifically the interaction between glucagon and insulin. This is represented by slide 1.\n4. Following this, the speaker provides a microscopic view of the pancreas, highlighting the islets and acini. This corresponds to slide 5.\n5. Finally, the speaker explains how insulin works to lower high blood glucose levels towards homeostasis, which is shown in slide 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is B: 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3.",

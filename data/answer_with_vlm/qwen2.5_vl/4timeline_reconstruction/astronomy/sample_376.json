The audio starts with a starry sky and the title \"The Cosmic Companion â€” SPACE: 2023,\" but it does not provide any context or information about the other events listed in the question. Therefore, it is impossible to reconstruct the correct chronological order based solely on the given audio.",

The images seem to be related to space exploration and cosmic companionship, but there's no mention of a world map, an animated kangaroo, a large moon backdrop, a bright orange ring, an eclipse visibility map, or a Pale Blue Planet title card. Therefore, I cannot reconstruct the correct chronological order based on the given information.",

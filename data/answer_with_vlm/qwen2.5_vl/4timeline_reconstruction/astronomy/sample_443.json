    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is C: 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5\n\nExplanation: The events described in the audio and visuals are:\n\n1. The speaker talks about Ptolemy's geocentric system and epicycles, which is event 2.\n2. A diagram shows text about \"apparent motion\" and being \"simpler than epicycles,\" while the speaker says retrograde needs no epicycles, which is event 3.\n3. The speaker likens retrograde motion to a runner overtaking as Earth passes Mars, shown in a Sun-centered model, which is event 1.\n4. A static title \"Heliocentric retrograde motion\" appears as the narrator says it was \"not perfect\" but \"peeked the interest,\" which is event 4.\n5. Galileo is introduced on a split screen as the first modern scientist who tested claims via experiments, which is event 5.\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order is C: 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5.",

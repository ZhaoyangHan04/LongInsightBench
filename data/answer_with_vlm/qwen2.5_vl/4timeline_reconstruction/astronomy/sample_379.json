    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\n\nExplanation: The timeline begins with the white title card showing \"KAIRA Kilpisjärvi Atmospheric Imaging Receiver Array\" (event 1), which introduces the topic. Then, a second male voice explains about EISCAT running incoherent scatter radars to measure the ionosphere where the aurora occurs (event 2). Next, a map marks Tromsø, Kiruna, and Sodankylä as a speaker describes a unique tristatic radar that measures 3D vector velocities (event 3). Following this, a crane lifts equipment at a snowy construction site while a speaker announces EISCAT 3D and notes current radars' \"long beam pencil\" limitation (event 4). Finally, a speaker contrasts phased arrays with dish antennas as snowy wind turbines are shown (event 5).",

Therefore, the answer is:\n\nanswer: Unable to answer\n\nExplanation: The audio only provides a brief mention of Finland and the KAIRA project but does not include any of the sub-events listed in the question. Without additional context or information about the sequence of events, it's impossible to determine the correct order.",

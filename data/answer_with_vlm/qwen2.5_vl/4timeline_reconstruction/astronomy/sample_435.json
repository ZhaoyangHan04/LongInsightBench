    "model_answer": "The answer is D: 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2\n\nExplanation: The speaker mentions the time in relation to the lunar eclipse, so we can use that as a reference point. The speaker notes the eclipse started at 15 minutes past three, which corresponds to option 4. Then, the speaker mentions opening a window about 30 minutes later, which corresponds to option 5. After that, the speaker mentions a plane and thin reddish contrail crossing the moon at 10 minutes past six, which corresponds to option 1. The speaker then remarks the moon starts leaving the umbra while a brighter crescent emerges above rooftops, which corresponds to option 3. Finally, the speaker states at 26 minutes past six the moon leaves the umbra and the eclipse ends a minute later, which corresponds to option 2.",

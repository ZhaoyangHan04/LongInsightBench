An animated pulsar with magnetic field lines is shown while she says they are strong in X-rays.\n3. She says magnetar magnetic fields are a thousand times bigger than a typical pulsar's.\n4. A black-and-white photo of the student-built radio telescope appears as she recalls it covered 2 hectares.\n5. A sweeping aerial of many satellite dishes appears as she says the Square Kilometre Array should let us see all pulsars in the galaxy.\n6. A visualization of a black hole with an accretion disk appears as she says no pulsarâ€“black hole system has been found yet.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

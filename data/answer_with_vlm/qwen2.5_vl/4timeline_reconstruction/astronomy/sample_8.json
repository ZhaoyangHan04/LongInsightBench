Then, the narrator mentions Daksha and Chandra's story in a colorful court animation (5). Next, the blue, multi-armed figure with a trident appears to a meditator as the narrator links the tale to waxing and waning phases (4). Finally, the sky graphic labeled “Rohini Nakshatra” and “Ecliptic” appears as the speaker computes 360/27 ≈ 13.33° (2).\n\nThe audio does not provide any direct information about the sequence of events, but the visual cues and the narrative flow suggest that the events should be placed in this order.",

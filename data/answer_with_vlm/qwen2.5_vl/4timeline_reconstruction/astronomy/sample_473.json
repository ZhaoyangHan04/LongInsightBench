Then, the differences between a quasi-moon and a traditional moon are explained (4). Afterward, the speaker mentions Kamoʻoalewa, a quasi-moon, and encourages the audience to stay tuned (2 again). The next scene shows a ballet dancer, which could be interpreted as a metaphor for the celestial ballet of the moon's orbit (3). Finally, the video describes Kamoʻoalewa's orbit around Earth and the Sun (6), and the narrator mentions that it was discovered in 2016 and unusually close (5).",

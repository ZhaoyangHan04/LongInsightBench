The audio only contains a man talking about his telescope and the deck he's sitting on, but it doesn't mention any of the specific events listed in the question. Therefore, there is insufficient information to reconstruct the correct timeline.",

The first event mentioned is about outlining the test setup, which would logically come before any actual capturing or processing. This is followed by the capture attempt where a shaky bright object is shown, indicating that the initial setup was not optimal. Then, the person optimizes the options for planetary imaging, which is a step before starting the processing in PIPP. After this, they create a folder and start processing the captured images. The next steps involve setting alignment points and frame stacking parameters, applying wavelets and RGB align, and finally merging the photos and adjusting curves/saturation.",

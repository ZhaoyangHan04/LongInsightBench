    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is B: 4 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3.\n\nExplanation:\n1. The first event (4) shows a snowfield with a green flag, which is likely the opening scene of the video. This is followed by the second event (6), where a laptop with colorful spectra is shown, indicating some form of scientific observation or analysis.\n2. The third event (2) takes place in a control room, where a male voice discusses the quality of the spectrum due to atmospheric noise. This suggests that the previous scenes were related to astronomical observations.\n3. The fourth event (5) shows a fiery object labeled \"X2,\" which could be part of the astronomical observations mentioned earlier.\n4. The fifth event (1) features an intense fiery explosion, which could be a dramatic representation of the effects of the astronomical observations or a transition to a new scene.\n5. The sixth event (3) shows credits/sky maps, indicating the end of the video.",

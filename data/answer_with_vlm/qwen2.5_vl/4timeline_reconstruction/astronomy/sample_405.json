    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events based on the video content is:\n\n1. The male speaker enthusiastically introduces “gravity on other planets” while a rocket logo appears on a blue screen.\n2. The speaker mentions gravity being measured in Gs as a blue “1.0 G” circle appears on Earth with celebrating stick figures.\n3. A portrait of Isaac Newton appears while the speaker explains the Universal Law of Gravitation.\n4. The speaker describes Venus as similar to Earth and explains gravity differences as Earth–Venus comparisons (densities, 8.87 m/s², 0.916 g) are shown.\n5. The speaker says Apollo astronauts were “jumping around like they were on a trampoline” while an astronaut walks on the Moon.\n6. The speaker notes Mars’s gravity is about “0.38G” as Mars–Earth values are displayed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

The speaker states Earth’s gravity is 9.8 m/s² as a small object falls toward Earth with “9.8 m/s” labeled.\n2. The speaker details Mercury’s physical characteristics while “2,440 KM” and “3.30 × 10^23 KG” are shown.\n3. The speaker says Saturn’s gravity is near the same as Earth’s while Saturn’s ringed planet visuals and values are displayed.\n4. The speaker transitions to the outer solar system “icy giants,” discussing Uranus then Neptune as Neptune’s values (e.g., “1.14 G”) are shown.\n5. Inside a spacecraft labeled “To FGB,” the speaker talks about zero-g’s importance for long missions, invites viewers to the description, and gives thanks as orchestral music starts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

This is followed by showing a colorful galaxy image titled \"Self-annihilation signals\" as he maps simulated universes and then says \"no\" (Slide 2). Next, a fiery image with \"No.\" on top is displayed while he explains the Milky Way's central black hole and pulsars emitting gamma radiation (Slide 3). Then, a slide labeled \"Direct Detection\" shows the Milky Way/solar system as he describes a dark matter wind that is faster for half the year and knocks atoms flying (Slide 4). Afterward, the \"A better detector\" slide shows a sodium iodide crystal detector, and he says it glows more when moving with the sun â€” \"the principle of sailing\" (Slide 5). Finally, split views of Stawell and a SUPL poster appear as he says they're excavating 1024 m underground and will place the detector there next year (Slide 6).\n\nThe speaker's specific statements and the sequence of events in the",

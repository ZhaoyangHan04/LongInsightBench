Then, an introducer presents Kimberly A. Williams's credentials and the audience applauds, which aligns with option 2. After that, the speaker mentions that Calgary ranks 22nd and in the bottom five, which corresponds to option 3. Next, a slide listing the ranking criteria appears, which matches option 4. Following this, a Calgary Herald headline about poor pay equity and employment for women is shown, which corresponds to option 5. The speaker then asks about rates of violence against women in Calgary, which aligns with option 6. Finally, a map titled \"Calgary's Domestic Violence Hot Spots\" is displayed, which corresponds to option 7. Therefore, the correct chronological order is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.",

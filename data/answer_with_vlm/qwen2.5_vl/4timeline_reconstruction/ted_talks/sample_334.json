    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is:\n\n1. A slide appears stating \"EVERY PROCESSOR WILL COME WITH A GEMESYS AI CHIP.\" (Event 1)\n2. He explains current smartphone assistants are centrally trained and asks for personalization so his phone understands him. (Event 2)\n3. A split-screen slide lists \"OUR BUSINESS MODEL... TWO INCOME STREAMS\" with \"$1 MILLION\" and \"7%.\" (Event 3)\n4. He details licensing to semiconductor manufacturers and gives a Samsung TV example. (Event 4)\n5. A traction slide shows \"â‚¬3,000,000+ government grant\" and \"50+ years of research.\" (Event 5)\n6. He says they finished a simulation, built first hardware neurons/synapses, and next will build the first IC in a fab line. (Event 6)\n7. He says \"thank you,\" and applause follows as the stage wide shot shows screens and the session time. (Event 7)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.",

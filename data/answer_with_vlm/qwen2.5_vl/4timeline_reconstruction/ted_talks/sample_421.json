    "model_answer": "The answer is C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\n\nExplanation: The speaker starts by mentioning the URL \"http://www.wordle.net\" in relation to comparing different social networks, which corresponds to moment 1. Then, he talks about webs of humanity and how networks form and what they do, which aligns with moment 2. Next, he transitions to discussing what flows through networks, leading to moment 3. Following this, he mentions getting a bird's eye view of networks and refers to the human super organism, which matches moment 4. He then states that we are connected and that every friend makes us healthier, which corresponds to moment 5. Finally, he shows a comic strip that illustrates how weight gain spreads from person to person and involves friends and family, which fits with moment 6. Therefore, the correct order is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

The speaker then describes seventh grade as \"one of the hardest years of life,\" which corresponds to event 4.\n3. The speaker recounts embarrassing internet advice for surviving seventh grade, which corresponds to event 5.\n4. The speaker explains the move to one teacher per subject and that self-learning begins, which corresponds to event 6.\n5. A question mark on the screen shifts to a fist while she fires rapid questions like \"How do I know this is true?\", which corresponds to event 1.\n6. A blue slide is shown while she encourages being bold and to stop worrying about being cool, which corresponds to event 3.\n7. She ends with thanks, applause follows, and TEDxOrlando credits appear, which corresponds to event 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is B: 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 1 -> 3 -> 7.",

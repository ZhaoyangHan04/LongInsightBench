The title slide \"Floatation for Service-Induced Stress\" with a dedication to Lance Corporal Lance Leedham appears first, which is event 1.\n2. Next, Bek says cannabis and flotation were the most symbiotic and invites Michael to explain flotation, which is event 2.\n3. Michael then explains how floating relieved insomnia, night sweats, and night terrors, giving him needed rest, which is event 3.\n4. Michael adds that floating helped him reconnect with emotions and, with cannabis, reprocess trauma, which is event 4.\n5. Finally, the \"Weeded Warrior\" logo and contacts fill the screen as he introduces the organization and the audience applauds, which is event 5.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

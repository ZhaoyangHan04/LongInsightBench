Then, the speaker introduces the topic by mentioning building a WhatsApp chatbot called \"Glific\" and showing newspaper clippings (Event 2). Next, a city map of Bengaluru with many green dots appears (Event 5), which likely represents the data collected through the chatbot. The speaker then reports collecting 5,400 data points in three weeks and that the High Court accepted them to hold BBMP accountable (Event 3). Following this, a developer in a light blue shirt introduces himself and explains \"Glific\" as an open-source platform for NGOs (Event 4). Finally, the video ends on a black screen reading \"IndiaFOSS 2.0\" with calm music (Event 6).",

This is followed by a speaker explaining that AI will disrupt every sector and highlighting leveraging data with machine learning (6). Next, a speaker explains he pursued a PhD and frames AI as modeling the human mind after being asked why humans strive to perfect AI (4). Then, a male speaker says managing the change from AI is more important than AI taking over and mentions new ways we’ll relate, as in the movie “Her” (1). After this, a speaker discusses the possibility of something awakening to its existence, endorses embodied AI, and another speaker agrees machines can think without perfectly imitating the brain (7). Finally, a male speaker says “one of the long-term goals” about creativity and social intelligence leading to a robot with its own mind; an electronic sound follows (5). The host then thanks participants and asks viewers for opinions on Twitter while the closing graphic shows Digital Futures branding and “Powered by Telefónica” (3).",

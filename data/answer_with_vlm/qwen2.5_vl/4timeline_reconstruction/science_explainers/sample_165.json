The chronological order of these events can be inferred from the descriptions provided:\n\n1. Event (2): \"Upbeat instrumental jazz plays as a blue arrow points to Oxygen ('O') with a 'TRULY' triangle above it.\" This event mentions oxygen, which is likely part of the periodic table discussion.\n2. Event (5): \"Gold ‘Au’ is highlighted in yellow with the labels ‘GOLD’ and ‘AURUS’ while the speaker identifies symbols.\" This event involves identifying symbols, which could be part of the periodic table discussion.\n3. Event (6): \"A phone briefly rings while the speaker lists essential elements alongside visuals of the human body’s composition.\" This event seems to involve listing elements, possibly related to the periodic table.\n4.

    "model_answer": "The answer is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\n\nExplanation: The timeline starts with a close-up of the Vicks box on a kitchen counter (1), followed by the speaker introducing a long-standing technology used for automobiles/engines. Then, in a store-like view of the box, the speaker says, “This is an ultrasonic humidifier,” and that he will read how it works (2). Next, the camera shows the “How It Works” text as the speaker explains tank-to-tray feeding, ultrasonic atomization, and a fan (3). The humidifier is then put back on and emits instant visible mist with a light watery bubbling sound as the speaker notes “instant vapor” (4). The box shows model V5100NS while the speaker names the model and warns about potential ultrasound burns (5). Finally, a close-up of the humidifier on a stove accompanies the speaker’s safety reminder about gasoline experiments, ending with “thank you” (6).",

The images show a Vicks Ultrasonic Humidifier box and its contents, but there is no mention of a finger pointing at a filter/lever, a hand indicating a lever/switch, a close-up of a transducer housing, turning a dial, or the humidifier emitting a visible cool mist. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the correct chronological order based on the given information.",

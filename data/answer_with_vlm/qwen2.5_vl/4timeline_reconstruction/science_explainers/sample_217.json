Then, the host introduces the topic by mentioning oral sodium bicarbonate and asking if a lotion improves cycling performance, which aligns with event 2. Next, the host discusses a scientific article about sodium bicarbonate improving high-intensity intermittent exercise, which corresponds to event 3. Finally, the host warns about high individual variability and cites a meta-analysis with smaller effects in trained athletes, which matches event 4. Therefore, the correct timeline is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.",

    "model_answer": "The correct timeline of events based on the provided video content is:\n\n1. The narrator welcomes viewers to a vodcast on Earth’s rotation and revolution as space-view titles appear.\n2. The rotation table fills in “The spinning of the Earth on its axis” while the speaker defines rotation and notes the tilted axis.\n3. The slide shows “23 hours 56 mins / 1 day” as the speaker says people round it to “24 hours.”\n4. A day/night Earth view appears while the speaker says the U.S. is in nighttime and Europe/Asia in daytime.\n5. Star trails labeled “Evidence of Revolution: Star Trails” are shown as the speaker introduces star trails as the first piece of evidence of Earth’s rotation.\n6. A Foucault pendulum knocks pegs with “30 seconds later/90 seconds later” captions as the speaker calls it the second piece of evidence and then pivots to revolution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

Then, the speaker introduces \"ten rules,\" criticizing symbol-focused teaching and stressing relationships, which corresponds to event 1. Next, the speaker says \"math can't be taught,\" adding that children learn by doing with real objects, which corresponds to event 3. After this, the text \"It Happens in the Head\" appears with a brain character as the speaker analogizes to music and says math happens in people's heads, which corresponds to event 4. Following this, a boy plays the piano, then the scene transitions to the title \"Math Needs Years of Practice,\" which corresponds to event 5. Finally, the speaker emphasizes years of practice and mental arithmetic using the example of understanding the number eight, which corresponds to event 6.",

Then, the speaker states that by age seven, most children can comprehend the whole and also divide it into parts (sub-event 3). Next, a girl uses scissors to cut a framed picture of blue and orange animal faces into two parts (sub-event 2). After this, a child writes the word \"Eight\" on paper under the heading \"EXPERIENCES PRECEDE LANGUAGE\" (sub-event 4). The speaker then asserts that most people have language, not math, problems, citing \"street mathematics\" (sub-event 6). Finally, the speaker says math can be expressed in different languages, moving from objects/images to numerals (sub-event 5).",

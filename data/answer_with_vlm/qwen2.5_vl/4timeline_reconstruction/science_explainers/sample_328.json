Then, the host explains the object class as Euclid over an IKEA exterior (sub-event 6). Next, he discusses the interior of SCP-3008, comparing it to being bigger inside and noting no accurate measurements (sub-event 4). Following this, he mentions exits changing and that 14 people escaped and were amnesticized (sub-event 5). Finally, he explains the day-night cycle with ceiling lights and that 3008-2 shout \"the store is closing,\" as the store lights go off (sub-event 1). Lastly, he speculates 3008-1 might be a portal or wormhole to other dimensions, as network graphics and \"THANKS!\" appear (sub-event 3).",

    "model_answer": "The answer is B: 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 6 -> 1 -> 3.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. Sub-event 4 is the first event mentioned in the question, which is the news report about NASA's DART mission to alter an asteroid's trajectory. This is clearly the first event in the sequence.\n2. Sub-event 5 follows, where the speaker introduces Dr. Steven Greer and mentions a fake alien invasion staged by NASA.\n3. Sub-event 2 comes next, where the speaker questions whether NASA is conducting a charade and reveals a FIRE DEPARTMENT sign.\n4. Sub-event 6 follows, where text states that a false-flag alien takeover has been planned for 75 years, and the speaker quotes Dr. Greer while a melancholic guitar begins playing.\n5. Sub-event 1 is the next event, where the speaker references Orson Welles' 1938 \"War of the Worlds\" causing panic, over images of saucers above crowds, with ominous ambient music.\n6. Finally, sub-event 3 is the last event mentioned in the question, where \"To be continued...\" appears, and the speaker asks for likes/shares, thanks researchers, and encourages subscription",

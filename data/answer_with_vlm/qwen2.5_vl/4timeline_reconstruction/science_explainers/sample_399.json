This aligns with the narration mentioning that the concept was untouched in Europe and preserved by scribes.\n   \n2. **Scholars in white turbans gathering around instruments**: This scene suggests a focus on the Islamic world and India, which is mentioned in the narration as the source of the concept that was untouched in Europe.\n\n3. **The narrator references “1632” and Jesuits trying to ban a concept as Principia is shown with Earth in the background**: This scene likely represents the introduction of the concept to Europe, where it was met with resistance from the Jesuits, as mentioned in the narration.\n\n4. **A portrait of Isaac Newton is shown with Principia and Analysis**: This scene shows the culmination of the concept's journey into Europe, where it was eventually formalized and applied by Newton, as described in the narration.\n\n5. **A stamp of Augustin Cauchy appears as the narrator says that in the 1800s epsilon–delta proofs formalized the infinitely small, enabling innovations like",

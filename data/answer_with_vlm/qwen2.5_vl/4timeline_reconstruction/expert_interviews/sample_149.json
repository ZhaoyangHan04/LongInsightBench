    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events described in the video is:\n\n1. A black background title with the interviewer’s and author’s names appears beside a pipe-holding portrait as a narrator introduces the upcoming conversation.\n2. An illustration of an elderly man writing with a quill is shown while speakers discuss being “caught up” in The Hobbit and waiting to see which option is right.\n3. A black-and-white bookshelf interview shot is shown as the speaker insists complex stories need a map, mentions moons/suns, cites “1942,” says he wrote it in the ’30s, and recalls “1949” revisions.\n4. The author stands before a Middle-earth map in a forest as he answers a question about feeling guilt as a philologist, defends linguistic wisdom, and says the Shire is like the first world he knew.\n5. Images tied to his life appear as he recalls Warwickshire countryside, arriving in England at one and a half, and even bathing in the Indian Ocean at two.\n6. A Fellowship collage and quote appear while he clarifies Midgard is this world imagined ringed by ocean—not another planet—and ends with an acknowledging “yes.”\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 1 -> 2",

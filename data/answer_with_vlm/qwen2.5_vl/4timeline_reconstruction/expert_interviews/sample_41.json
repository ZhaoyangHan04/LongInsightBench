Then, the video transitions to a two-shot with the Hollywood sign visible, where the host asks Cynthia about her start and mentions the Enron collapse in 2001, which corresponds to event 2. Next, Cynthia recounts her experience in Houston, which corresponds to event 3. The host then reacts by calling Enron \"bonkers\" and mentions the documentary \"the smartest guys in the room,\" which corresponds to event 4. Cynthia then explains the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and its impact on auditors, which corresponds to event 5. Finally, they pivot to new-year advice, explicitly mentioning 2018 and 2019, which corresponds to event 6.",

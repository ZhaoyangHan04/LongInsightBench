The question \"How has Blizzcon been for you?\" (1) is asked first, followed by her response (2). Then, she mentions meeting at BlizzCon after chatting on Discord (4), which logically precedes her pride in representing New Zealand in esports (3). The next question is about differences in opinion during games (5), followed by her explanation (6). Finally, the last question is about the reaction in her community to her participation in BlizzCon (7). Therefore, the correct chronological order is 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.",

    "model_answer": "The correct order is B: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The video starts with an on-screen ID that labels Steve Scully with C-SPAN (option 2).\n2. The interviewer then introduces the advice topic by mentioning his work at various TV stations before C-SPAN (option 1).\n3. Steve Scully then gives his advice: \"get internships\" as the best piece of advice (option 3).\n4. The interviewer describes hiring a former intern for a C-SPAN position (option 4).\n5. The plaid lower-third again labels him \"Steve Scully\" during a close-up (option 5).\n6. The interviewer says \"some great advice... the fundamentals are still so important,\" and he replies \"that will never change\" (option 6).\n7. The interviewer asks about his future plans; he reflects on his long tenure, she thanks him, and he offers a friendly compliment (option 7).\n8. The video concludes with a wide shot framing both guests on black armchairs against the black curtain (option 8).\n\nThis sequence matches option B.",

Then, the scene changes to a gym-like room where he contrasts a subset of smart geeks and cites NSA, Google, and Microsoft (sub-event 6). Next, we see him in a whiteboard office where he describes reading Debian mailing lists to find people who shared his vision for Ubuntu (sub-event 5). Following this, he is back in the gym-like room where he concludes narrowing Debian's scope would be wrong (sub-event 3). Finally, he returns to the skull-flag office where he mentions Steve Jobs before disagreeing over licensing and access (sub-event 4).",

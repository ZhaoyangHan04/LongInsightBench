This corresponds to option 1 in the list. Then, the word 'Emergence' appears with a pixel effect as the emergence is explained, which corresponds to option 3. Next, a four-circle diagram of core areas appears as the speaker turns to self-organization, which corresponds to option 2. After that, 'Entropy' with binary numbers and a 'Sync' network are shown as the narrator links self-organization to information theory and synchronization, which corresponds to option 4. Finally, the title 'Nonlinear Systems Theory' appears as the speaker says he will move onto non-linear systems and chaos, which corresponds to option 5. Therefore, the correct chronological order is A: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.",

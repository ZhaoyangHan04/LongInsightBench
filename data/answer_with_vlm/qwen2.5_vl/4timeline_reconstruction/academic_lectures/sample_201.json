Then, Eske Willerslev introduces the topic by saying there will be a press release tomorrow about the first original Australian genome (2). Next, Dr Michael Bunce describes isolating DNA from hair shafts (4). Following this, Eske explains that they used a 1920s Southwestern Australian hair sample to avoid recent European admixture (3). Finally, Dr Michael Bunce compares sequencing to a \"billion-piece jigsaw\" (5), and Dr Joe Dortch adds that archaeological evidence extends the presence to \"70,000 years perhaps\" (6).",

The audio only mentions Professor Eske Willerslev speaking about early expansions eastwards and the subsequent movement into Europe and Asia, but it does not provide any context or information about the other individuals mentioned in the question. Therefore, it is impossible to arrange the events in the correct order based on the given audio.",

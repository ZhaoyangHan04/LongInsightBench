    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.\n\nExplanation: The audio describes the events in a specific sequence that matches option C. The title \"Plate Tectonics & California Geology\" appears first (event 1), followed by the 3D subduction-zone diagram showing oceanic crust subducting and a volcanic chain (event 2). Then, a satellite view highlights Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak with red arrows during the discussion of volcanic activity (event 3). Afterward, a shaking-intensity animation of the Bay Area plays as the narrator identifies the Loma Prieta earthquake (event 4). The distinct \"slam\" sound ends the segment after mentioning the San Andreas fault and subduction (event 5). Finally, a quiz slide with a yellow \"PAUSE NOW\" box appears as bluesy rock music starts and the narrator reviews plate-boundary topics (event 6).",

The audio seems to be a tutorial on plate tectonics and California geology, but it does not mention any of the specific events listed in the question. Therefore, we cannot determine the correct sequence based solely on the given audio.",

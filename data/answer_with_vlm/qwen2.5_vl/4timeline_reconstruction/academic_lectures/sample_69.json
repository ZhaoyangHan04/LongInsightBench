Then, the full Eighth Amendment quote is displayed on the screen while being read aloud (event 2). Next, the on-screen text \"EXCESSIVE BAIL SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED\" appears as the host defines bail (event 3). Following that, the on-screen text \"NO CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENTS SHALL BE INFLICTED\" appears as the host stresses it's \"and, not or\" (event 4). Afterward, a black-and-white bearded photo appears as the host discusses Furman v. Georgia (event 5). Finally, the host signs off, invites subscriptions, and the background \"la la la\" music fades out (event 6).\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they do not follow the correct sequence of events in the video.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events based on the visuals and narration provided is:\n\nA: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second event (2) shows a stick figure standing on Earth beside a spider and a bird with crossed-out speech bubbles, asking about the evolution of language abilities and saying \"Who knows?\". This is likely the opening scene of the video.\n2. The first event (1) involves explaining the comparative method's limits (~5,000 years) while showing Spanish/Portuguese pairs under a \"comparative method\" label. This follows logically after the initial scene, as it introduces a specific linguistic concept.\n3. The third event (3) presents a list reading \"Proto-World Existed / Sort of Existed / Didn't Exist\" along with a woman outlining scenarios and saying \"proto-world didn’t exist at all.\" This event comes next, as it discusses the existence of proto-world, which is related to the previous event about the comparative method.\n4. The fourth event (4) shows a divergence diagram of humans, chimpanzees, and bonobos (7 million YBP), with a female voice mentioning humans in Africa ~1",

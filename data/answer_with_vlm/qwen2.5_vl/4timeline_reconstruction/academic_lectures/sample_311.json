The click sound is heard right after the narrator introduces the lymphatic system's functions, which corresponds to event 2 in the timeline.\n2. The narrator then explains thoracic pressure and clears her throat, which aligns with event 4 in the timeline where the narrator says 90% diffuses back.\n3. The green lymphatic vessels labeled \"Lymphatic Vessels\" appear as the narrator notes the system has no heart, which corresponds to event 1 in the timeline.\n4. The \"Lymph Flow\" screen with moving arrows and \"Skeletal Muscles\" appears, and the narrator mentions skeletal muscles, which corresponds to event 5 in the timeline.\n5. The text \"One-Way Valves\" is added while the narrator explains thoracic pressure and then clears her throat, which corresponds to event 3 in the timeline.",

Next, a large blue virus appears next to the baby (5), indicating the process of T-lymphocyte maturation and the elimination of harmful cells. Then, the text \"secretes thymosin\" is shown in the body diagram (1), and finally, the low-pitched humming is heard while the narrator mentions that thymosin may stimulate lymphocyte migration (3).\n\nThis sequence aligns with the given options and the information presented in the visuals and sounds.",

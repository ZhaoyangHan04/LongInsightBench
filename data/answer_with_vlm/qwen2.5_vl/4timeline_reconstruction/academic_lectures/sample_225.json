This aligns with the speaker admitting their vague understanding but saying the word-boundary method gives a working algorithm. The upbeat musical interlude also fits here.\n\n2. **Visuals and Audio Cues for Event 4**: The video shows a light bulb labeled \"Syllable\" and blue-oval visuals appearing. The speaker acknowledges their vague understanding but mentions the word-boundary method provides a working algorithm. This is followed by a short upbeat musical interlude.\n\n3. **Visuals and Audio Cues for Event 1**: The video shows \"Hell Mit\" vs \"Helm It\" drawings while the speaker analyzes \"helmet\" and how the m sound changes by syllable position. This event is clearly after the previous two events since it involves a specific example and analysis.\n\n4. **Visuals and Audio Cues for Event 2**: The video shows three yellow ovals labeled",

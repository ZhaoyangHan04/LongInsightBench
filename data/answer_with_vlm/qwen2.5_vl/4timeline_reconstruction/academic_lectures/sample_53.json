This is the starting point as it's the initial statement about the topic.\n- Event (2) follows where the brain model is shown, highlighting specific parts like the limbic lobe and cingulate gyrus, which is a logical progression after introducing the limbic system.\n- Event (3) comes next as she introduces the hippocampus and shows it by opening the lateral ventricle, which is a step further in her explanation of the limbic system.\n- Event (5) is when she identifies the amygdala under the uncus and discusses its role in emotion, which logically follows the previous events as she continues to explore different parts of the limbic system.\n- Event (4) is when she explains the Papez circuit, which is a summary of the connections she has been discussing so far.\n- Event (6) is when she lists the ventricular horns and notes the inferior horn's location, which is a continuation of the discussion on the limbic system.\n- Event",

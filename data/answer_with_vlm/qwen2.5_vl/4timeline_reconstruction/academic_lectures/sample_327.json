Then, the speaker mentions that there will be ten comparisons, which aligns with option 2. Next, the speaker discusses the \"AHP Evaluate Alternatives\" table, which corresponds to option 3. Following this, the speaker mentions that price was not taken as a criterion to separate benefits from costs, which corresponds to option 4. The cost-benefit graph is then shown, contrasting Model 1 vs 3 and Model 2 vs 4, which corresponds to option 5. Finally, the speaker concludes with a slide about AHP's applications, followed by a switch to rhythmic music, which corresponds to option 6. Therefore, the correct sequence is A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

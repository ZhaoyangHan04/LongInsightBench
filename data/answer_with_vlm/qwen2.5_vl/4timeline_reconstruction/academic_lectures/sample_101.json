Therefore, the answer is:\n\nanswer: Unable to answer\n\nExplanation: The audio does not contain any specific details about the events listed in the question, such as the exact context or sequence of events related to the elasticity of demand examples. Without this information, it's impossible to determine the correct order of these events.",

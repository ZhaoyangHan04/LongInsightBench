    "model_answer": "The events described in the video seem to be related to a chemistry lesson involving potential energy diagrams. Let's analyze the sequence of events based on the provided information:\n\n1. The speaker is labeling energies on the whiteboard when a school announcement interrupts him. This suggests that the speaker was in the middle of explaining something on the whiteboard before being interrupted.\n2. The whiteboard graph is erased, leaving only the \"PE\" label, as he talks about the endothermic one. This indicates that the whiteboard had a graph on it, which was erased after the interruption, and then he continued talking about endothermic reactions.\n3. On a sheet of paper, he writes an equation and compares endothermics to adding money to a checkbook. This event seems to be unrelated to the whiteboard and could be part of a different segment of the lesson.\n4. He concludes his explanation with a statement about potential energy diagrams and a distinct slam sound as the whiteboard with the methane equation is shown. This suggests that he finished his explanation and showed another whiteboard with a different equation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct chronological order of the events would be:\n\nA: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3\n\nThis order follows the sequence of",

The white precipitate forming at the bottom of the test tube during the NaCl + AgNO3 demo (event 2) is the first event mentioned in the sequence.\n2. The \"Gas-Forming Reaction\" slide showing \"Sodium Carbonate plus hydrochloric Acid\" (event 4) comes next, as it's the slide that introduces the reaction.\n3. The page-turn sound (event 5) indicates the transition from the previous slide to this new slide.\n4. The jazz music interrupting after mentioning sodium carbonate and hydrochloric acid (event 1) happens after the slide change.\n5. The male narrator explaining limewater tests for carbon dioxide and saying acid is added to the flask first (event 3) follows the interruption.\n6. Finally, the bubbling and the limewater turning cloudy (event 6) occur as the gas passes through the limewater.",

The female speaker calls the acid-base demonstration exothermic (event 3).\n2. The yellow cursor highlights the word \"salt\" on the Acid-Base reactions slide (event 2).\n3. The \"Redox Reactions\" slide appears introducing electron transfer (event 4).\n4. A grinding/sanding-like noise is heard after the redox intro (event 1).\n5. Loud machinery with a male voice introduces copper and nitric acid, with bubbling (event 5).\n6. A slide shows red equations for copper reacting with nitric acid while a female explains copper nitrate and a brown gas (event 6).\n7. The final title screen with Department of Education and 2Enable.org logos appears (event 7).\n\nThe visual also supports this sequence as it shows the slides in the same order as described in the audio.",

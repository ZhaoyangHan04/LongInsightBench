Next, she talks about the replacement by hydroxyl group (slide 7). Afterward, she presents the reactions involving retention of diazo group â€“ coupling reactions (slide 4). Then, she mentions diazonium salts as intermediates for various groups (slide 5). Finally, she introduces the assignment (slide 1) and concludes with credits and disclaimer screens (slide 3).",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of the events based on the video content and narration is:\n\n1. The word \"PROPORTIONS\" appears while the narrator defines a compound as different atoms bonded together.\n2. CO and CO2 diagrams show mass ratios 12:16 and 12:32 as the narrator states CO2 is 73% oxygen and 27% carbon.\n3. A cartoon mole appears with \"Return of the Mole!\" as the narrator defines one mole as 6.022×10^23.\n4. The slide titled \"Empirical Formula\" gives the lowest whole-integer ratio definition as the narrator echoes that phrasing.\n5. A beaker fills while the narrator says water’s empirical and molecular formulas are both H2O.\n6. The screen shows HCl values (Cl 3.0, H 2.1) and ΔEN = 0.9 while the narrator begins talking about atomic radius as an average bonding radius.\n7. The \"Atomic Radius and Ions\" slide appears as the narrator explains cations are smaller than neutral atoms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> ",

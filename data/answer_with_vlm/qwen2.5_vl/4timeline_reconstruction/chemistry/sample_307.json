    "model_answer": "The correct order of events based on the provided audio and visuals is:\n\nA: 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 1\n\nExplanation:\n1. The upbeat intro music plays before the speaker introduces the spectroscopy series (Event 2).\n2. The 'spectroscopy' definition slide appears as he explains energy transforming in molecules (Event 4).\n3. A brown object and a red wave appear as he says the particle model is poor and waves are a better (but imperfect) model (Event 3).\n4. Two red wavy lines are shown as he defines light as oscillating electric and magnetic fields (Event 5).\n5. A red wave enters a complex molecular diagram as he discusses electric-field interactions and says magnetic ones will be in NMR later (Event 6).\n6. Graphs appear as he lists UV-Vis, IR, and rotational spectroscopy (Event 1).\n\nThis sequence matches option A.",

This is followed by the introduction of the goal (pure silicon dioxide/silicic acid), which is option 3. Next, we see the pouring of hydrochloric acid into the plastic bottle containing the sample, which is option 4. Then, the speaker discusses the amount of sodium silicate solution to be added, which is option 6. After this, the speaker notes that the mixture is now acidic, which is option 5. Finally, the injection of a substance via syringe into the bottle triggers bubbling foam that overflows, which is option 1. Therefore, the correct chronological order is 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5 -> 1.",

The audio primarily focuses on the synthesis of silicic acid and silicon dioxide, and does not mention the specific steps involved in the separation, drying, and final weighing stages. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nanswer: Unable to answer",

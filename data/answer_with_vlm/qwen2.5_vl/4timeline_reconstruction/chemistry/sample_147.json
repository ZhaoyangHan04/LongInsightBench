    "model_answer": "answer: C: 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3\n\nExplanation: The events unfold as follows:\n\n1. The video starts with the introduction of the periodic table, where the narrator calls it \"the most important tool\" and mentions calculators (event 4).\n2. The on-screen word \"Periods\" appears over a color-coded grid as the narrator explains rows numbered 1-7 and points out the two bottom rows pulled out in the long-form layout (event 2).\n3. The narrator describes the older Roman numeral A/B system and notes three columns labeled 8B (event 1).\n4. The title switches to \"Groups/Families\" and the narrator says columns are called groups/families with properties changing down a group (event 6).\n5. The table is recolored into red metals, purple metalloids, and blue nonmetals while the narrator introduces periodic properties and representative elements (event 5).\n6. The narrator says hydrogen \"acts more like lithium than fluorine\" and should be on the left as the three-color table remains on screen (event 3).\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order is 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5",

Then it moves on to group 2 (alkaline earth metals), which is option 5. Next, the narrator talks about group 17 (halogens), which is option 6. After that, the discussion turns to group 18 (noble gases), which is option 1. Following this, the narrator introduces the spiral table and discusses the transition and inner transition metals, which is option 4. Finally, the circular display is shown, which is option 3. Therefore, the correct chronological order is 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3.",

This is likely a transition slide or a break in the lesson, so it comes after the introduction but before the detailed explanation of stoichiometry.\n- Event (3) is the explanation of the Haber-Bosch process with a 1:3:2 ratio and mentions Windex, which is a specific topic within the lesson.\n- Event (4) is the definition of \"mole ratio\" and the balanced equation N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3, which is a fundamental concept in stoichiometry.\n- Event (5) is the question about the number of moles of NH3 produced when 0.4 mol of N2 is used, which is a practical application of the mole ratio concept.\n- Event (6) is the solution to the problem and the explanation of the result, which follows the question asked in event",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is:\n\nA: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\n\nExplanation:\n- The audio mentions that a male voice notes stoichiometry is found in many video games while a crafting interface screenshot is shown. This corresponds to event 1.\n- The next event mentioned is a slide with the chemical equation N2 + 3H2 ↔ 2NH3 and grey mole-info boxes, along with a female explaining reactants should equal products. This corresponds to event 2.\n- Then, the \"STEPS TO STOICHIOMETRIC EQUATIONS\" slide is on screen while a male says to identify the known and the unknown and ignore irrelevant substances. This corresponds to event 3.\n- Following this, a male discusses the 0.4 mol N2 problem, saying hydrogen will be disregarded when setting proportions as the table for X (ammonia) is shown. This corresponds to event 4.\n- Next, a female talks about the 1.6 mol NH3 problem, stating nitrogen is ignored and setting X for moles of H2. This corresponds to event 5.\n- Finally, a female states \"2.4 moles of hydrogen\" after cross multiplication",

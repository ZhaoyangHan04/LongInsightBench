    "model_answer": "The correct order of events based on the provided information is:\n\n1. The title screen for \"General Chemistry II Video Lecture 40 Dr. William J. Doria\" appears while upbeat jazzy music plays and the instructor begins introducing nuclear reactions.\n2. The first definition slide shows the word \"Fusion\" with a blue explanatory sentence beneath it.\n3. The equation \"12C + 16O -> 28Si\" is on screen as the speaker says carbon-12 and oxygen-16 react to form silicon-28.\n4. An aerial view of a large circular construction site is shown while the speaker explains that reactors are being built though the technology is expensive.\n5. On-screen text spells out \"International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor\" and \"ITER\" as the speaker talks about that specific reactor starting experiments.\n6. A close-up of the Sun with an on-screen UTC timestamp appears while the speaker pivots to fusion in stars, asks how such reactions begin, and background music fades in.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.",

    "model_answer": "The correct order is C: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\n\nExplanation: The events described in the audio follow a logical sequence that starts with the formation of a star from a hydrogen gas cloud (event 1), which is then followed by the process of hydrogen fusing into helium (event 2). This is then followed by the discussion of heavier stars and the Sun's lifespan (event 3), which leads to the formation of carbon and oxygen through nuclear reactions (event 4). The next event is the description of the red giant phase and the eventual formation of a white dwarf (event 5), and finally, the speaker mentions supernovas as a conclusion (event 6).",

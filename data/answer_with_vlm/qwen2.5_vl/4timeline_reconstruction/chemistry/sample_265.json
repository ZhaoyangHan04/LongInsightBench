This is followed by the statement that the dripping slows down after several minutes (4).\n- The filter paper with the dark solid is then removed and laid flat to dry overnight (5).\n- Finally, the next day, the dried product plus filter paper is weighed (6).\n\nThe on-screen text \"Several minutes later...\" in frame 4 provides the necessary timing information to place this event between steps 3 and 5.",

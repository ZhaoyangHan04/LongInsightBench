    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The first event is the screen displaying \"Heating Under Inert Atmosphere\" alongside a green balloon setup, which corresponds to option 1 in the list.\n2. The second event is the female narrator explaining that argon is preferred and describing how to fill an elastic balloon using a syringe or a three-way stopcock, which corresponds to option 2 in the list.\n3. The third event is the male narrator explaining how to connect a three-way stopcock to an inert gas cylinder, filling the balloon, inserting it into a flask, and purging with a vacuum line, which corresponds to option 3 in the list.\n4. The fourth event is the appearance of a graphic labeled \"Dean and Stark Trap,\" which corresponds to option 4 in the list.\n5. The fifth event is the female narrator explaining the Dean-Stark operation, including azeotrope collection and monitoring progress by water volume or milkiness, which corresponds to option 5 in the list.\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.",

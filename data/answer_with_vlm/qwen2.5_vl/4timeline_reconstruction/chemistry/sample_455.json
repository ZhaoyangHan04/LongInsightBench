    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is:\n\nA: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\n\nExplanation: The events in the video follow this sequence. First, we see two men talking about going to someone to demonstrate the process step-by-step (event 1). Then, the female narrator defines boiling point and shows a diagram (event 2). Next, the narrator mentions choosing a heat source and plans to use a Bunsen burner (event 3). After that, the Bunsen burner is lit and adjusted (event 4). Following this, a diagram appears showing thermometer placement and glassware clamped into the distillation setup (event 5). Finally, the narrator concludes by reviewing the steps (event 6).\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they rearrange the events out of their logical sequence. For example, option B places event 2 before event 1, which contradicts the video content where the two men are already talking when the narrator starts defining boiling point.",

    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order of events based on the provided information is:\n\nA: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\n\nExplanation:\n1. The speaker begins by discussing the synthesis of resveratrone and iso-resveratrone, mentioning cis-trans isomerization, cyclodimerization, bicyclohexanol, and fragmentation leading to resveratrone. This corresponds to event (1).\n2. The speaker then discusses a retrosynthesis/epoxide-olefination scheme with Li reagents, noting a problem requiring two equivalents, possible catalyzed rearrangement, and heat/survival concerns. This aligns with event (2).\n3. Next, the speaker talks about an epoxide olefination/boronate slide with a yields table, mentioning reducing the boronic ester to approximately 1.3 equivalents, having almost no regioselectivity, and separating regioisomers using reversed-phase HPLC. This corresponds to event (3).\n4. The speaker then shows fluorescence spectra comparing resveratrone and iso-resveratrone, stating that the resveratrone boronic ester was unstable and thus applied the synthesis to an isoresveratrol derivative for click labeling.",

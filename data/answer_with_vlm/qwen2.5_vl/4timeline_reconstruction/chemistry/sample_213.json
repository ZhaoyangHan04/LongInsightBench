    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is C: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6.\n\nExplanation: The process starts by adding benzyl chloride to the hexamine solution on the hot plate (event 1). This leads to the formation of distinct layers and crystals in the condenser (event 3), which is followed by starting the reflux (event 2). The addition of concentrated HCl causes thick fog, and plans for immediate distillation are made (event 5). After distillation, the organic layer is separated for further processing (event 4), and finally, the HCl is neutralized with water and CaCO3 (event 6).",

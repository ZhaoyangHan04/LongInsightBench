Then, the interviewer says the words \"vacuum distillation\" during the initial lab conversation (1). After that, the narrator begins explaining the mechanics of an oil-immersion rotary vacuum pump (3). Next, the pump diagram adds the label \"gas expelled\" with arrows indicating flow (4). The narrator then stresses the pump must never be open to the atmosphere and explains the need for a cold trap (6). Finally, warning text appears: \"Never draw air through a vacuum pump\" (5).",

    "model_answer": "The answer is D: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8\n\nExplanation: The video starts with a green slide reading \"Check for star cracks,\" which corresponds to option 1. Then, the narrator instructs to use flasks that withstand evacuation and to check for damage first, which corresponds to option 2. Next, the narrator says the joints are sealed with vacuum grease and the setup is tested for leaks, which corresponds to option 4. After this, a green slide labeled \"Receiver adapter\" appears, which corresponds to option 3. Then, the narrator describes connecting to the vacuum pump and regulating pressure while stirring for smooth boiling, which corresponds to option 6. Following this, a green slide lists \"Step 8: Open manometer, Record temperature, Check pressure, Close manometer port, Eliminate leaks,\" which corresponds to option 7. Finally, the narrator reviews reduced-pressure distillation steps, including heating slowly and collecting fractions, which corresponds to option 8.",

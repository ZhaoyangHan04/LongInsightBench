    "model_answer": "The correct order of events based on the provided audio content is:\n\n1. On the ENTHALPY slide, the speaker explains exothermic reactions release heat while endothermic reactions require energy, noting some only occur at higher temperatures.\n2. The decomposition equation CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g) with a positive ΔH is shown on the screen.\n3. The speaker emphasizes that limestone decomposes only around 1100 K and is otherwise non-spontaneous at STP.\n4. The ENTROPY slide presents the First and Second Laws; the speaker states energy is constant and cannot be created or destroyed.\n5. The \"ENTROPY ON THE MOLECULAR LEVEL\" slide lists adding particles/energy and increasing volume; the speaker describes these as ways to increase randomness.\n6. The \"ENTROPY + PHASES\" and \"ENTROPY + SOLUTIONS\" visuals appear; the speaker says gases have the greatest entropy and ions gain entropy when dissolving.\n7. The ENTROPY slide shows the Third Law; the speaker says a pure crystal at absolute zero has zero entropy and no motion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 ->",

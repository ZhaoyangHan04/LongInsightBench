    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The speaker starts by saying \"but let's start here,\" which indicates this is the first event (1).\n2. Next, the speaker uses experiment 1 values to plug into the rate law and solve for k (3). This comes before comparing experiments 1 and 2 (2).\n3. After comparing experiments 1 and 2, the speaker explains how to cancel out parts to clarify units (4).\n4. Then, the speaker writes the full rate law with K and says \"rate equals 210,000\" (6).\n5. Finally, the speaker emphasizes that k doesn't always have the same units and says he's coming to the end (5).\n\nTherefore, the correct order is B: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5.",

Next, the speaker mentions \"OUR IDEA\" slide with two bullets, which is event 2. Then, the speaker shows the outputs from their CNN on an X-ray and mentions that the model predicts pneumonia with 99% probability, which is event 3. Following this, the speaker introduces Grad-CAM and AZGC, which is event 4. Afterward, the GUI titled \"BRUGERVENDELIG GUI\" is shown, which is event 5. Finally, the speaker offers to take questions and the audience applauds, which is event 6.",

The speaker begins by explaining the GUI titled \"BRUGERVENDELIG GUI,\" which is option 5 in the list. This is the first thing mentioned in the audio, indicating this is the starting point.\n2. Next, the speaker discusses the X-ray images and the bar graph, mentioning \"Normal,\" \"Grad-CAM Heatmap,\" and \"Zones.\" This corresponds to option 3 in the list.\n3. Following this, the speaker explains how the Grad-CAM is divided into zones colored by red pixels, allowing radiologists to compare and agree/disagree. This aligns with option 1 in the list.\n4. Then, the speaker talks about automatically generating a box plot with zone names such as \"right lung mid,\" providing exact numbers. This matches option 2 in the list.\n5. Finally, the speaker gestures at three X-ray images and a bar graph, highlighting \"Right Lung Lower\" as the highest. This corresponds to option 4 in the list.\n\nTherefore, the correct chronological order is D: 3 -> 1 -> 2 ->",

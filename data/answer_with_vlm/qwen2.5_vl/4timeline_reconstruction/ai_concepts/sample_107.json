Next, he introduces out-of-network sourcing via Social Graph and mentions GraphJet (3). After that, he explains embedding users and tweets into a community space across many interests (4). Then, the Ranking using ML Model slide appears, introducing the neural network ranker (5). Finally, he describes filtering and blending to avoid repeats and mix tweets with ads (6).",

Next, the speaker mentions a slide titled \"Inverse Rendering with NePu,\" which shows four black horse silhouettes with given camera parameters, corresponding to option 2. Then, the speaker discusses optimizing a latent vector by minimizing binary cross-entropy and using multiple initializations, choosing the one with the highest IoU, which corresponds to option 3. Following this, the speaker mentions slides showing \"Target Mask\" and \"Pose Optimization\" examples for a human and a pigeon, which corresponds to option 4. The speaker then discusses zero-shot synthetic-to-real experiments with giraffes and a cow, which corresponds to option 5. Finally, the talk ends on a project page slide with a QR code, which corresponds to option 6.",

The presenter shows the CVPR 2018 paper “Sketch-a-Classifier” and introduces three models from it. This is the first event mentioned in the sequence.\n2. A diagram titled “MRN #2: Sketch(s) to Photo Classifier” appears as the narrator explains using a sketch to generate a photo classifier. This follows the introduction of the paper and models.\n3. The speaker says, “It’s pretty neat, right?” while discussing a fine-grained classifier. This statement comes after the introduction of the models and the diagram.\n4. A slide with an orange arrow labeled “Regularization Loss” is displayed, accompanied by light background music. This event is mentioned after the discussion about the fine-grained classifier.\n5. The audio details cross-entropy minimized with Adam while a “Sketchy Database” paper and retrieval results are shown. This event follows the display of the regularization loss slide.\n6. The speaker ends with a call to like and subscribe as upbeat electronic music plays. This is the final event in the sequence.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they",

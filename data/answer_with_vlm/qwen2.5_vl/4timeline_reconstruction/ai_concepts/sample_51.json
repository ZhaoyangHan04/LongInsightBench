Then, the video transitions to a grayscale robot, which matches event 2. Following that, the video shows two kids under a blanket with a tablet, which aligns with event 3. Next, a smart speaker with a blue ring is shown, corresponding to event 4. Afterward, a futuristic holographic \"AI\" interface is displayed, which fits event 6. Finally, researchers in lab coats around a laptop are shown, which corresponds to event 5. Therefore, the correct chronological order is 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5.",

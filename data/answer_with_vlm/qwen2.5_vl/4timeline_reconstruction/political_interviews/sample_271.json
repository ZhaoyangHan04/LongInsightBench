Then, Julia says she previously ran for Position 2 in 2018 on a “system change” platform (6). After that, a blue banner with Vote411.org and lwvpdx.org appears at the bottom (3). The moderator then asks about police–community relations, deadly force, and officer accountability while the split-screen shows both women (1). Finally, the closing segment thanks viewers, reminds them the primary is on Tuesday May 19, and dramatic orchestral music and credits play (4).",

The audio does not provide any specific timestamps or transitions that would help determine the sequence. Additionally, there is no clear indication of when each event occurs relative to the others based on the visuals alone. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the correct chronological order with the given information.",

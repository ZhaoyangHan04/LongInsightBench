This is followed by Rep. Paul saying there's no declared winner and that the race isn't over. Then, the caption shows \"PRIMARY IS FOR DISCUSSING ISSUES\" as he says he wants to debate the issues. After this, the anchor asks about a role in a Romney administration, to which Rep. Paul says it's unlikely but cordial, with differences in beliefs. Next, the Romney rally footage appears with signs as captions note a \"'CORDIAL' RELATIONSHIP WITH ROMNEY,\" while Rep. Paul critiques hawkish foreign policies. Finally, the anchor raises the Supreme Court Obamacare case, predicting a constitutional ruling and discussing the Commerce Clause.",

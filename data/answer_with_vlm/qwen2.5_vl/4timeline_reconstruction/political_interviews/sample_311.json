The detainee starts by explaining being blindfolded, handcuffed, and driven in circles in a blacked-out van until carsick (Event 2).\n2. This is followed by a brief rustling sound, indicating the arrival at a location where he was blindfolded, brought into a room, and then had the blindfold removed (Event 5).\n3. After removing the blindfold, the detainee describes sleeping on plywood without bedding for 60 days, using a corner hole as a toilet (Event 6).\n4. He then details an 8-by-9-foot windowless cell with a \"pigeon hole\" for food (Event 4).\n5. The detainee gestures emphatically while describing being walked through a lane with red lights to a room, and also mentions a green-lit \"green room\" (Event 1).\n6. Finally, he states that the second 60 days were debate-focused and ended with signing a long statement/confession (Event 3).\n\nThis sequence follows the logical progression",

This is followed by the narrator's description of being taken to a room (sub-event 4), where he recounts the interrogators asking for his entire life story (sub-event 1). The narrator then describes a language tactic used during the interrogation (sub-event 6), and finally, he describes the second 60 days of the interrogation process (sub-event 3).",

The video clips show a man speaking at a podium, but there is no indication that this is the Prime Minister of Pakistan or that he is delivering condolences on behalf of the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Additionally, there is no mention of the Prime Minister appearing in a formal setting with flags, nor is there any indication that the Prime Minister is analyzing the growth of Islamophobia or citing Salman Rushdie's book and 9/11. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the correct chronological order of the events based on the information provided in the video clips.",

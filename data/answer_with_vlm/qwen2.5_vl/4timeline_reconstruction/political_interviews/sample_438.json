Then, he criticizes one-party dominance in Hawaiian politics and mentions the need for more parties in the legislature, which aligns with event 2. Following this, he says, \"That's ridiculous,\" and asks how to pass legislation with only one party, which matches event 3. The scene then changes to a large hall where a woman named KIM COCO is speaking, which corresponds to event 4. She discusses adding representative democracy through house rules and criticizes the legislature's exemption from the Sunshine Law, which aligns with event 5. Finally, she states a preference for robust opposition parties, and the man briefly responds by thanking her, which corresponds to event 6.",

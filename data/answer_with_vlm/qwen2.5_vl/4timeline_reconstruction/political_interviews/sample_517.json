This is followed by a clip showing a man in a light blue shirt discussing the suffering caused by slavery, which aligns with option (4). The guest then stands on the side of truth and emphasizes teaching the \"awful legacy of slavery,\" which matches option (2). The host then moves on to note criticisms from Black Republicans, including Tim Scott and John James, which corresponds to option (1). The anchor then pivots to Trump obstruction charges over deleting security footage and asks about the guest's pardon stance, which aligns with option (5). The guest defines a \"process crime\" and says he would pardon Trump to move the country forward, which corresponds to option (6).

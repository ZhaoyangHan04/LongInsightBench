    "model_answer": "The correct order is B: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\n\nExplanation: The video starts with opening titles \"TENT TIPS\" appearing with upbeat music and the store location text (moment 1). Then, a calm male voice instructs to open the package and lay out poles while the on-screen label \"BILL--GLENN--TRACI\" is shown (moment 2). Next, the tent fabric is spread flat with audible rustling as someone says it's like unfolding a sheet (moment 3). After that, the instructor says \"we build this tent from the top down,\" sliding roof poles and doing the ring-and-pin step with a groan heard (moment 4). Then, the rainfly is walked over the tent and its underside Velcro is wrapped around the frame (moment 5). Finally, a speaker says the tent is fully upright and explains guy lines should extend at a 45-degree angle (moment 6).",

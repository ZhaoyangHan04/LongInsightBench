    "model_answer": "The correct chronological order is:\n\nA: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6\n\nExplanation:\n- The first moment (1) involves Kevin introducing himself on the Sahaj√§rvi trail and mentioning a small rope ferry, which suggests he is starting his journey.\n- The second moment (3) shows him setting up a tarp shelter, indicating that he has reached a location where he will spend the night.\n- The third moment (2) describes him arriving at a forest clearing and mentioning a nice view of the lake, which likely follows setting up the shelter.\n- The fourth moment (4) provides information about the temperature dropping overnight, suggesting it happened after he arrived at the forest clearing.\n- The fifth moment (5) shows him holding a yellow cup by the tent, indicating he is enjoying a morning coffee, which logically follows the previous events.\n- The sixth moment (6) describes him standing on the dock and saying he's back on the ferry to head home, indicating the end of his trip.\n\nTherefore, the sequence A is the most logical reconstruction of the events based on the provided information.",

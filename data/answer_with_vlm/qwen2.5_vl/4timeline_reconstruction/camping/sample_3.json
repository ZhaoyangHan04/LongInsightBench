Then, there's a close-up of flying insects against a blue sky, which matches moment 2. Following that, we see a view from a vehicle of a calm lake and distant island, which aligns with moment 4. Next, there's a continuation of insect close-ups, which corresponds to moment 3. Finally, the video ends with a lakeside scene and a campground rules board, which matches moment 5.",

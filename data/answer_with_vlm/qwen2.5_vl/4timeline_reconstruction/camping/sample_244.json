The audio mentions Anzac Day weekend, but it does not specify if this is before or after any of the other events. Additionally, there is no mention of a metal contraption, a white sluice/highbanker, or a pump being present in the video. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the correct order of events based solely on the provided information.",

    "model_answer": "The events described in the audio seem to follow a logical sequence related to the process of emptying a gray tank in a recreational vehicle. Here's how they might be ordered:\n\n1. The speaker moves to the front gray tank, attaches a hose, then pulls a lever; liquid dumping is heard. (This is the initial step where the process begins.)\n2. The speaker pushes levers in and warns about vibration opening tanks; the gray tank undercarriage is shown. (This step follows the initial action of pulling the lever and hearing liquid dump, as the speaker would likely check the tank after the initial pull.)\n3. Water is visibly flowing from the red hose under the trailer to the drain. (This step comes next, as the hose is now connected and water is being drained from the tank.)\n4. The speaker says, \"All right, I got it all out,\" followed by a whoosh as the hose is emptied. (This indicates the end of the draining process.)\n5. The gray tank lever at the rear is pulled while water is heard flowing. (This step occurs before the final statement, as the speaker would likely pull the lever again to ensure the tank is completely empty.)\n6. The speaker declares the gray tank dumped, clears the hose,",

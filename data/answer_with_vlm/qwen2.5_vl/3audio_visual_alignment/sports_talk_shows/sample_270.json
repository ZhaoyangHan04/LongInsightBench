    "model_answer": "answer: D: A wide shot of the L.A.X team standing at the approach while only “GO BOWLING” and “PBA League” logos are visible, without any speed/RPM data.\n\nThe audio mentions that the commentator introduces Anthony Lavery-Sphar to get things going and that LAX will start on the left lane. However, there is no mention of a close-up of Anthony Lavery-Sphar releasing a ball or a strike-track overlay showing speed and RPM. The audio also does not mention a static crowd shot or a full-screen match intro graphic. Therefore, option D is the most likely correct answer as it matches the description provided in the audio.",

The audio mentions a strike but does not include the exact phrases \"watch the numbers on the right\" and \"Wait a minute! Oh no! What on earth was that?\" Therefore, it's impossible to determine which on-screen visuals correspond to these moments.",

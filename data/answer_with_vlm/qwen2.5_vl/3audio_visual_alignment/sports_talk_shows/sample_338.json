    "model_answer": "The answer is B: Money line betting â€” picking which team will win; favorites cost more and underdogs can pay more.\n\nIn the audio, the man discusses the concept of betting on favorites versus underdogs, indicating that favorites typically have higher odds but lower payouts, whereas underdogs may offer higher odds and potentially higher payouts. This aligns with the definition of moneyline betting, where the goal is to predict which team will win outright, with the odds reflecting the perceived likelihood of each outcome. The other options (spread betting, over/under totals, and parlays) do not specifically address the comparison between favorites and underdogs in terms of odds and potential payouts.",

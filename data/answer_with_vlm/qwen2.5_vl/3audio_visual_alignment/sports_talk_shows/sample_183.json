    "model_answer": "answer: D: The hostâ€™s studio setup with sneaker shelves and neon signage, without the Twitter screen visible.\n\nReasoning: The speaker is condemning a meme related to CM Punk's WrestleMania main event 2024, which suggests that the meme is likely displayed on the screen behind him. However, the question specifically asks what is shown on screen at the same time as the speaker's condemnation, implying that the screen content is not directly related to the meme itself but rather the overall setting of the video. Therefore, option D is the most appropriate choice as it describes the host's studio setup with sneaker shelves and neon signage, which is consistent with the background seen in the video.",

There is no gym footage or any indication of being in a gym environment. Therefore, option D is the most appropriate answer.",

    "model_answer": "The audio does not provide any information about a cat being visible on the floor, so option A can be eliminated. There's no mention of a large, colorful astrological chart overlay appearing in the frame, so option B can also be ruled out. The speaker does not mention a cosmic-themed promotional card with contact details replacing the room view, so option C is not correct either. However, the speaker does mention a transformative time and suggests giving in to the 'title wave,' which aligns with the visual detail of the backdrop showing silhouettes of warriors with the text 'Mars Vs Pluto.' Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: D - The backdrop shows silhouettes of warriors with the text 'Mars Vs Pluto.'\n\nThis answer is based on the information provided in the audio and the visual details described in the images.",

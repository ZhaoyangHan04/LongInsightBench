The visuals described in the other options (A, B, and C) are not mentioned in relation to the speaker discussing legal barriers. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the screen is blank at that moment.",

Given this context, it is reasonable to assume that the screen displays the title slide related to the topic being discussed. Therefore, option D is the most likely correct answer.",

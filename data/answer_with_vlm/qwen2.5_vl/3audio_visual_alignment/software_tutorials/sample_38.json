The speaker mentions that a confirmation box should appear asking if they want to continue, which implies that the user has navigated to a point where an installation process is about to occur. However, the video shows a browser page with a white background and several empty boxes acting as placeholders, indicating that the user is still on the initial page of the browser, likely the home page or a new tab, before any specific action like installing an extension is initiated. Therefore, option D is the most accurate description of what would be shown on screen at that moment.",

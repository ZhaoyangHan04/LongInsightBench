The speaker is describing the process of aligning the exposed strands of two wires (one red and one black) to create a low-profile connection that will be covered with shrink tubing. The images show a close-up of these wires with their exposed strands, which aligns with the description in the audio. The presence of a blue connector on a metal surface further supports this observation.",

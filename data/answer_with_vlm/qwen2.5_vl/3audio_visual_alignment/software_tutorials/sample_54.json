    "model_answer": "Answer: A: A fit results panel/table displaying parameters including xc (center), A (amplitude), and w (FWHM), along with Reduced Chi-Sqr and Fit Status beside the fitted peak overlay.\n\nReasoning: The speaker mentions clicking \"fit until converged\" to complete the Gaussian fit, which implies that after this action, there should be a visual confirmation of the fit. This confirmation typically includes a panel or table showing the parameters such as xc, A, and w, along with other statistics like Reduced Chi-Sqr and Fit Status. Therefore, option A is the most likely correct choice.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is A: The Dialog Fit (Gaussian) window is open with settings/parameters while the graph shows two labeled peaks (B Peak 1 and B Peak 2), their individual fits, and the cumulative fit curve.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the information provided in the audio where the speaker mentions that they have the FWHM values for two peaks and that these values are being used to fit the peaks. This implies that the software is performing a Gaussian fit on the peaks, which would typically be done through a dialog box or window within the software. Additionally, the presence of labeled peaks and a cumulative fit curve suggests that the graph is displaying the results of this fitting process. Therefore, option A is the most likely scenario.",

The images only show the speaker talking in front of a fence and trees.

The fact that he mentions being kept in a concrete box with silent guards implies that this is part of a larger narrative or story, which would be more likely to be shared with someone else. The occasional look to his left could indicate that he is looking at the person who asked about exercise.",

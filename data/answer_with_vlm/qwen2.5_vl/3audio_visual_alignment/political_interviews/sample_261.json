    "model_answer": "answer: B: A close-up of a damaged nuclear facility overlaid with \"Crisis at Fukushima\" and \"Radiation measured at 10 times normal.\"\n\nThe question asks about the visual accompanying the Greenpeace radiation expert's voice during the event. The expert is explaining that people would exceed the maximum annual permitted dose in just a couple of days due to the radiation levels. The correct option B describes a close-up of a damaged nuclear facility with text indicating a crisis and high radiation levels, which aligns with the expert's explanation about the severity of the situation. Option A mentions a map and the Japanese flag, which is not mentioned in the question. Option C refers to the anchor in the studio, which is not relevant to the expert's explanation. Option D talks about a person in a hazmat suit, which is not mentioned in the question either.",

However, the provided images do not show any tables or columns being highlighted or outlined. Instead, they display text slides with titles and descriptions related to DBMS keys. Therefore, there is no information available from the images to determine which option is correct based on the audio content.\n\nanswer: Unable to answer",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is C: An attempted insert for a student with BRANCH_CODE ‘EIC’ is shown being rejected, alongside a DB error because ‘EIC’ is not in the Branch Table.\n\nThis option directly aligns with the information provided in the audio, where the speaker mentions that using a non-existent code like 'EIC' results in an error due to the enforcement of making BRANCH_CODE a foreign key. The on-screen visuals would likely show such an attempt and the resulting error message, indicating the enforcement of data integrity in the relationship between the tables.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: A thin stick is used to transfer red liquid from a small vial onto one of several transparent strips on a white surface, creating a small red line.\n\nThe speaker describes using an applicator stick to check for clots in a well-mixed EDTA tube. The visual shows a hand holding a vial with a pink cap, which is likely the EDTA tube mentioned in the audio. The hand then uses a thin stick to transfer red liquid from the vial onto a transparent strip on a white surface, creating a small red line. This matches option A, where a thin stick is used to transfer red liquid from a small vial onto a transparent strip, creating a small red line. Option B is incorrect because the stick is not just dipped into the vial and pulled out; it transfers liquid onto a strip. Option C is incorrect because the vial is not capped; it has a pink cap. Option D is incorrect because there is no mention of a slide or a staining jar in the audio.",

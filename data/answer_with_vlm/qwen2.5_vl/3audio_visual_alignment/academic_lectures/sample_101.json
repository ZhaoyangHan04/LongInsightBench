The correct option should show a graph or visual that illustrates an increase in total revenue following a price increase.\n\nOption D: A “REVENUES” graph with a rising green line, accompanied by the equation “TR = PxQ”, is the most appropriate choice as it directly depicts the relationship between price (P) and quantity demanded (Q), and how total revenue (TR) increases when the product of these two factors rises due to a price increase.\n\nThe other options do not represent a graph or visual that clearly illustrates the concept of total revenue increasing with a price increase:\n\n- Option A: A utility pole set against a bright blue sky with scattered clouds does not relate to the topic at all.\n- Option B: A simple drawing of a light bulb with radiating lines is too abstract and does not convey any specific information about total revenue.\n- Option C: A “SALES” graph where a red line shows a slight decrease after a rate increase contradicts the information provided in the question, as it suggests a decrease in sales rather than an increase.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: A “REVENUES” graph with",

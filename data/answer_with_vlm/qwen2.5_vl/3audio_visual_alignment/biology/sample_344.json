    "model_answer": "The correct answer is:\n\nA: A left-side cellular schematic showing rhodopsin signaling to phosphodiesterase and the conversion of cGMP to GMP adjacent to a cyclic nucleotide–gated Na+ channel.\n\nExplanation: The audio describes the process of light-activated rhodopsin activating phosphodiesterase, which then converts cyclic GMP to GMP, and this process affects a cyclic nucleotide–gated sodium channel. This description aligns with option A, which presents a detailed cellular schematic illustrating these processes. The other options either focus on different aspects of the visual pathway (option B) or are unrelated to the described process (options C and D).",

Phenylephrine is indeed an adrenergic receptor agonist that is commonly used in ophthalmology to dilate the pupils. The other options are not relevant to the content shown on the slide.",

Therefore, option D cannot be confirmed based on the given information.\n\nThe correct answer is: \nA: He explains that parasympathomimetic drugs stimulate a parasympathetic response via muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.\nB: He uses pilocarpine as an example and mentions its clinical use in constricting pupils.\nC: He defines a sympathomimetic drug as an adrenergic receptor agonist used to dilate pupils for eye exams.\n\nThese statements are supported by the content of the audio segment, where the speaker discusses the effects of parasympathomimetic drugs like pilocarpine on the parasympathetic nervous system and their use in constricting pupils.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: Insulin stimulates body cells to take up glucose and store it, while inhibiting glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, thereby lowering blood glucose levels.\n\nThis option aligns with the scenario described in the audio and visual content. The audio mentions that insulin is released when blood glucose levels rise, which is consistent with the visual showing hyperglycemia (160 mg/dL) and a subsequent drop to 90 mg/dL. Insulin's role in lowering blood glucose levels by stimulating glucose uptake and storage in cells, as well as inhibiting the breakdown of glycogen and production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, is accurately described in option A.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: A 100X magnified field where lighter-staining circular islets are marked by arrows alongside darker-staining acini.\n\nThis answer is based on the information provided in the audio. The speaker mentions that they are describing lighter-staining circular regions (islets of Langerhans) and noting nearby blood vessels and endocrine alpha/beta cells. This description aligns with option B, which states that there is a 100X magnified field showing lighter-staining circular islets marked by arrows alongside darker-staining acini. The other options either describe different magnifications, include incorrect details about the pancreas, or mention unrelated content like diabetes mellitus.",

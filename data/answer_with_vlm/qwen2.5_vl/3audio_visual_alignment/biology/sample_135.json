The image only shows a diagram of a ribozyme structure with labeled parts. Therefore, it's impossible to determine what audio event might have occurred based solely on this image.",

    "model_answer": "The correct answer is A: A diagram of pre-mRNA showing the branch-point adenine, labeled 5′ splice site, lariat formation, and exon ligation (Group II splicing).\n\nThis answer is chosen because the speaker mentions Group II intron splicing, which involves the 2′-OH of a specific adenine attacking the 5′ splice site, leading to the release of the intron as a lariat. The image provided shows a diagram of pre-mRNA with labels for the branch-point adenine, 5′ splice site, lariat formation, and exon ligation, which aligns with the description of Group II splicing.",

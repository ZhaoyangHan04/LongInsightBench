    "model_answer": "Answer: A: A probe is inserted into a large vessel of the heart while the specimen is handled on a blue tray, demonstrating a pathway from the right ventricle.\n\nThe speaker mentions putting a probe down into the pulmonary trunk to show how it connects to the right ventricle. This aligns with option A, as it describes the insertion of a probe into a large vessel (the pulmonary trunk) of the heart, which is consistent with the speaker's explanation.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: The person uses tweezers to manipulate and point at internal heart structures over a blue tray.\n\nThe speaker mentions using a probe to identify the pulmonary semilunar valve and the moderator band, which implies that the heart is being manipulated and examined internally. This aligns with option A, where the person is using tweezers to point at internal heart structures. Option B is incorrect because the speaker mentions using a probe, not scissors. Option C is incorrect because the speaker does not mention inserting a probe into the pulmonary trunk. Option D is incorrect because the speaker is actively manipulating the heart, not just showing on-screen text.",

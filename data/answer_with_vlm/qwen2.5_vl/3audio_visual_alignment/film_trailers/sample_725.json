    "model_answer": "answer: C: A suspension bridge at dusk silhouetted against an orange-pink sky.\n\nThe video shows a suspension bridge at dusk with an orange-pink sky in the background. The narrator mentions \"the trail has led to this discotheque,\" which suggests a transition from the bridge scene to a discotheque setting. However, the question asks about the setting shown on screen during the specific time frame mentioned, so we should focus on the visuals of the bridge. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",

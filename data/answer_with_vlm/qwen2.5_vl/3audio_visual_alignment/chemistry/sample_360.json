    "model_answer": "The hand in the video is pointing to the peak of the curve labeled B, which is marked as the activation energy. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: The peak of the curve labeled B, marked as the activation energy\n\nThis is because the activation energy is the energy barrier that must be overcome for a reaction to proceed, and it is represented by the height of the peak in the potential energy diagram.",

    "model_answer": "answer: B: The product energy line is drawn lower than the reactant energy line\n\nThe speaker mentions that 30 kilojoules of energy has been released, which indicates an exothermic reaction. In the diagram, we see that the product energy line (the lower horizontal line) is positioned below the reactant energy line (the upper horizontal line). This visual cue suggests that energy is being released from the system, as the products have less potential energy than the reactants. Therefore, option B correctly identifies the visual cue that indicates the exothermic release of energy.",

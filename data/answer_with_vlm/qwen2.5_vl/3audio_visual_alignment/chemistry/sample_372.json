The video shows a red litmus solution being added to a beaker, but there is no mention of a blue litmus solution or its reaction with an acid. Therefore, I cannot determine which option is correct based on the given information.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is C: That bases turn red litmus blue, and blue litmus remains blue in bases.\n\nThe speaker explains that when litmus is added to a base, it turns blue, and when added to an acid, it turns red. In this case, the left beaker turned blue, indicating it contained a base, while the right beaker turned red, indicating it contained an acid. Therefore, option C correctly describes the behavior of litmus in relation to bases and acids.",

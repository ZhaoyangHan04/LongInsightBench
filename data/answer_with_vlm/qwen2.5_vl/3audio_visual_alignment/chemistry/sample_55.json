    "model_answer": "answer: D\n\nThe speaker explains that thermodynamic analysis treats dissolution as a reaction, using sodium chloride dissolving in water to predict the equilibrium constant from the Gibbs energy change. The visual shown at this time is a single hydrated ion illustration showing only Na+ surrounded by water molecules with general solvation text. This matches option D.",

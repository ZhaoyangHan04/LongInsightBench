    "model_answer": "answer: D: A collage of tarot cards fills the right side of the frame.\n\nThe speaker mentions a report about Kremlin preparations and a possible 1951 attack on Yugoslavia, which aligns with option A. However, the speaker also says that an attack on Yugoslavia in 1951 should be considered a \"serious possibility,\" which suggests that the speaker is discussing a potential future event rather than a historical fact. This implies that the on-screen content should be related to the future, which is consistent with the tarot card collage appearing on the right side of the frame. Therefore, option D is the most appropriate answer.",

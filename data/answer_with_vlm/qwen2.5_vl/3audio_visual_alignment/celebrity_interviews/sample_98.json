The audio descriptions only mention a female speaker saying \"Let me shoot my shot\" and a male voice pleading for people not to bash Olivia, but there is no mention of a hand being raised or leaning closer to the camera. Therefore, it's impossible to determine which audio aligns with that specific moment based on the given information.",

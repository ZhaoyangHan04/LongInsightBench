    "model_answer": "answer: A: A portrait labeled “Newton” with a glowing bulb at center, yellow arrows radiating outward, and a white hand cursor pointing at the bulb.\n\nThe narrator describes Newton's concept of light as particles, comparing it to \"bullets coming out\" from a bulb. The visual on-screen matches this description, showing a portrait of Newton with a glowing bulb in the center, yellow arrows radiating outward, and a white hand cursor pointing at the bulb, indicating interaction with the visual representation of the idea.",

    "model_answer": "The answer is B: The text “Light -> Aether Medium” over a computer animation of a bulb with yellow dots and an inset image of a water droplet.\n\nThis option matches the description in the audio where the speaker mentions the \"aether medium\" and Huygens' consideration of light as a vibration carried by it. The visual elements described in option B align with this explanation, including the text \"Light -> Aether Medium,\" the computer animation of a bulb with yellow dots (representing light), and the inset image of a water droplet (representing the aether medium).",

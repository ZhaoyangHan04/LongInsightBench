    "model_answer": "The speaker is referring to the single-block free-body diagram labeled P, W, F, and N with tipping/slipping notes. This diagram shows the forces acting on a block, including the normal force (N) and the friction force (F), which is directly related to the normal force as described in the equation F_max = Î¼_s * N. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nAnswer: C",

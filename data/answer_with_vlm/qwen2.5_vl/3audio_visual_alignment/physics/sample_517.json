However, there's no mention of historical footage or a graph, so option B and A can be eliminated. Option C is also not mentioned in the audio, leaving option D as the most likely correct answer.",

    "model_answer": "answer: C: A neutral wide shot of the workshop focusing on the orange-and-black seat and gray exercise ball with no slide shown.\n\nThe speaker is explaining the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) by describing how acceleration components are combined. There's no mention of any visual aids like slides or objects being held up. The background shows a workshop setting with an orange-and-black seat and a gray exercise ball, which suggests that the focus is on the workshop environment rather than any specific visual aid. Therefore, option C is the most likely scenario based on the information provided.",

    "model_answer": "Answer: A: \"The goniometer moves into its starting theta and two-theta positions.\"\n\nReasoning: The narrator's statement directly corresponds to the on-screen motion of the mechanical device/goniometer moving into position to begin a scan. This aligns with option A, which describes the goniometer moving into its starting theta and two-theta positions, indicating the beginning of a scan. The other options either describe unrelated events (red lights illuminating, busy light turning off) or state a general fact about the instrument rather than describing the specific motion observed in the video.",

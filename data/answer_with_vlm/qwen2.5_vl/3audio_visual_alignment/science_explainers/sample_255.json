    "model_answer": "The correct answer is B: A surreal painting of a man in a bowler hat with a green apple obscuring his face.\n\nIn the audio, the narrator mentions food-borne diarrhea as an example of an infection that can be explained by the germ theory. The surreal painting of a man with a green apple obscuring his face visually represents this concept, as it suggests that the apple (a common food item) could be the source of the infection. The other options do not directly relate to food-borne diarrhea.",

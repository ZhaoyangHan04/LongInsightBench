This aligns with option D, as it shows the eclipse paths for both 2017 and 2024, which would be relevant to the discussion about the alignment of the Moon and Sun.",

    "model_answer": "answer: Unable to answer\n\nThe provided audio segment does not contain any information about cicadas, the solar eclipse, or Giant City State Park. The map shown in the image is related to the 2024 Solar Eclipse and highlights various cities and percentages across the United States. There is no mention of Makanda, Nineveh, or Shelby Park in the audio, so it's impossible to determine which locations are visually highlighted on the map at that moment.",

    "model_answer": "answer: B: An iceberg floating in the ocean beneath a bright sun.\n\nThe male speaker uses the analogy of an iceberg to explain that what we observe is just the tip of the iceberg, while there's much more hidden beneath the surface. This aligns with option B, which depicts an iceberg, representing the observable reality (the tip), and the ocean and sun, symbolizing the hidden potential matter (the submerged part). The other options don't relate to the iceberg analogy used by the speaker.",

    "model_answer": "answer: B: A global map crowded with airplane icons showing live air traffic\n\nThe question mentions that the narrator discusses how GPS is a military system with public aspects used to track air traffic, and it specifically references sites like planefinder.net. The on-screen imagery that would best reinforce this point would be a visual representation of live air traffic, which aligns with option B. This imagery directly connects to the use of GPS for tracking air traffic, as it shows the real-time movement of aircraft across a global map. The other options do not directly relate to the specific point being made about GPS and air traffic tracking.",

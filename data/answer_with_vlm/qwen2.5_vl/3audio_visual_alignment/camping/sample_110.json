The content of the audio seems to be about a man talking about something in a garage, mentioning a bucket and a sluice, but none of these elements match the scenario described in the question. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine which statement the speaker makes when the camera shows a hand pointing toward a section of the stream.",
